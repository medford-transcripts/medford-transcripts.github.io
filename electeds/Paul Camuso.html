 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2294.778s">Unmute.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2295.899s">Getting</a> used to this Zoom stuff, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2298.841s">Paul</a> Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2303.453s">First</a> of all, I want to thank Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on, you know, as, as a former athlete at Medford High School, I love to see that we're trying diverse to diversify the athletic programs and the recreational programs in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2320.246s">Just</a> a few years ago we were very lucky to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2323.208s">get</a> the recreation department into full swing, you know, and to expand it to include more diverse opportunities for Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2331.176s">It's</a> just a win-win, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2334.038s">I</a> really think that this is going to take off, you know, you look at the Barchi court, the old Italian Americans love Barchi for the most part, and a lot of other people are now becoming <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2344.608s">part</a> of that bocce league at not only the boat club, but also the new bocce courts here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2351.131s">For</a> many, many years, people would go over to the Italian club over in Malden to participate in bocce and to see bocce and now pickleball come to fruition, I think it's a great opportunity for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2362.555s">Furthermore,</a> just on a side note, we have a lot of snowbirds in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2366.557s">The</a> biggest voting blocks and the biggest group in this community, when you look at the numbers, are the senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2373.942s">And</a> to give them more opportunity to enjoy their golden years of retirement, I think you have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2379.305s">And</a> I really appreciate you making an effort to put this in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2382.587s">On</a> another side note, my mom is a snowbird, as most of you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2386.049s">And</a> down in Naples, they actually have a tournament that brings in thousands upon thousands of people that play. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2392.093s">And</a> they actually set up professional pickleball courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2394.834s">It's</a> a big facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2396.195s">And</a> three years ago when I visited my mom, I never even heard of pickleball, but it certainly is something that's taken off, not only here, but down in Florida where the retirees go down and enjoy the nice warm winters that we unfortunately don't have up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2412.759s">So</a> I just wanted to go on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2414.219s">If</a> I could too, as a former member of the council and a parent of a student in the Medford Public Schools, I think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2421.921s">I</a> used to put this on yearly when I was a member of your honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2425.542s">but</a> I think the safety audit of all the parks to make sure, especially now, because once the parks are up and running, I think you're gonna have more people out there this year than ever due to the fact of the COVID-19 situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2437.811s">So</a> if you could, somebody think about putting on the agenda or making a paper to have the parks department do the safety audit, just to go through the entire facility structures and check all the nuts and bolts so that we can prevent injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2450.34s">I</a> think it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2451.501s">no</a> win, it's a win-win for the community and we can't go wrong when we're trying to provide safety to the senior citizens and in this particular case, the youth of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2462.046s">So</a> once again, thank you to Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2466.349s">I</a> like when you guys think outside the box, you get down there on Tuesday night and you do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2471.271s">So</a> I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2473.612s">And</a> on another note, <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2475.333s">You</a> guys are showing leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2477.154s">You're</a> showing people that the country can still move forward under this devastating vaccine program that's before us now in the COVID situation by showing up on Tuesday nights and getting the people's business done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2489.161s">The</a> continuity of government has to be paramount. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2493.323s">And</a> the people that are there tonight are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2494.884s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3182.794s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3185.443s">Paul</a> Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3188.105s">Thanks</a> again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3189.986s">Just</a> I'd like to make a quick comment on the upcoming elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3193.528s">We</a> all know that with COVID and the last few election cycles, there's been some movement around the VFW is no longer a polling place, as well as some other minor moves. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3205.175s">The</a> temple, excuse me, not the temple, the American Legion. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3209.837s">And</a> I think it's important that you get the message out via all the communication <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3214.901s">that</a> you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3216.564s">Some</a> people received ballots last election that didn't put in for a mail-in ballot like myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3220.913s">I</a> actually brought that to the attention of the city clerk at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3224.159s">I</a> just think there has to be a <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3226.267s">very</a> good PR push to let everybody know what's going on, just because there's so many moving parts with COVID and the secretary of state just filed a bill for mail-in voting to become permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3237.231s">So</a> whatever direction it goes in, I just think the public needs to know, because not everybody picks up the Boston Globe and reads the papers and does all their research. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3246.274s">So</a> it's incumbent upon this city to do that aspect of notifications, I believe.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3v7haMF7rG4/2024-11-19_3v7haMF7rG4.html">City Council 02-16-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7585.195s">Hi,</a> my name is Paul Canuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7589.756s">First</a> of all, good evening to the Honorable City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7593.657s">I'd</a> just like to go on record, you know.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7597.878s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7598.958s">We</a> hear a lot lately of looking for additional ways to raise revenues and whether it's going to be a proposition two and a half or a debt exclusion by certain members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7610.261s">And</a> I'm all for things to make our city better. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7613.062s">But</a> what I'm not for is <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7615.682s">You</a> know, there's, this is a, this is, this as a proposed, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, it's going to be an additional tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7624.67s">You</a> know, I talked to my landscaper who does about 25 houses on our street, and they're talking about an extra a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars per household, because if they have to use rakes and not the proper equipment to do the job, then they're not going to be able to do it for the same price. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7640.163s">You</a> know, I'd rather see our money go towards the schools, go towards the fire department, the police department, and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7647.348s">With</a> all due respect, I think that this is an overshot of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7651.912s">I</a> think that this is going to put a burden on people that take their homes and their beautiful homes and try to make them better. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7658.657s">You</a> know, if the landscape prices keep going up, you're going to see people not getting it done because it's unaffordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7665.602s">And</a> I don't want to see that happen in my community that I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7668.528s">I</a> think this is an overstep of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7670.653s">And</a> I really believe that we should take a step back and really look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7674.97s">You</a> know, you drive by homes in this community, people can't maintain the properties as they are in some occasions, and it's not fair to the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7682.714s">But</a> with that being said, I just wanted to go on record in absolutely opposing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7687.817s">I</a> think you're gonna hear from a lot of the landscapers in the community, the DPW, and Michael Marks, you're right on target, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7693.84s">How</a> can you say that the city can do them next to Morrison Park, Placestead Park, and other parks, but you can't have your home cleaned? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7700.643s">It</a> doesn't make sense, Mr. President, but I just wanted to go on record and be against this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7705.406s">And</a> thank you for taking the time to listen to me.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_9sF78fOJr5I/2024-11-19_9sF78fOJr5I.html">City Council 06-23-20</a></h2>

President Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13019.015s">I</a> speak from my experience as a member of the school committee and as a city councilor for about 16 years here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13028.36s">First</a> of all, the budget that we received, I want to thank the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13031.921s">Read</a> it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13033.562s">It's</a> got a lot of information, a total overhaul of budgets of years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13039.867s">And</a> I'm glad that it was presented in the format that it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13043.551s">I</a> think it's a great collaboration from all the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13047.274s">The</a> narratives were great and the charts and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13051.177s">But</a> as far as the discussion that's going on regarding meeting in Zoom and meeting in the council chambers, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13061.04s">I</a> absolutely understand that there is a lot of value in meeting at the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13067.445s">You</a> know, yeah, when you have to look people in the eye on tough debates and things of that nature, and quite honestly, after watching this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13077.159s">and</a> some other meetings that are on Zoom, the decorum, the Robert's Rules of Order are in place for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13083.341s">And</a> it's a lot easier to keep an orderly meeting, I think, if you're at a public meeting rather than on Zoom, just because the technology is a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13094.385s">But</a> like I said, I do not envy any of you guys during this COVID time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13099.107s">This</a> city has stepped up amazingly, the city council, the mayor's office, the school department, everybody, to meet the needs of the people in our community with this COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13108.75s">It's</a> unprecedented, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13112.071s">And</a> I think that somewhere along the line, and I really got to credit the entire council tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13119.415s">for</a> the motion that was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13120.436s">I</a> believe it's basically for like a mediation with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13123.32s">I</a> don't know if that's the correct word to use, but Marianne O'Connor, who I've had the privilege of knowing over the years, she is a consummate professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13131.142s">and</a> as well as the members of the school committee, the council, the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13135.764s">If</a> there's a way to do a hybrid model, I think it would be the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13139.906s">Just</a> because of the fact, like you said, people can have both, you can come down there if your health allows you to, and you can also participate on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13149.81s">The</a> one good thing that I am encouraged by this evening is the participation, but <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13155.712s">The</a> name calling and stuff that was allowed to happen tonight on all sides of this issue, it's not Medford that we can be proud of, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13164.535s">We</a> should all be working together to move Medford forward in a way that we all love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13169.917s">Whether</a> you've been here for a hundred years or you've been here for a hundred days, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13173.978s">You</a> moved here because you like something in this community and it can always be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13178.052s">It</a> can always be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13180.193s">I</a> suggest, like I said, I hope tomorrow Vice President Caraviello, President Falco, with the mayor and other people can sit down and let cooler heads prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13190.318s">One</a> thing that has been frustrating on Zoom, just when I've watched it, is sometimes they have to call the roll three, four, five times to find out how people are voting and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13200.103s">The</a> technology is iffy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13202.904s">I</a> understand <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13204.714s">I</a> understand that it's a good tool, but at the same token, it's something that can... <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13210.413s">whether</a> it's a slow internet connection on a specific night or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13214.416s">Um,</a> it does, does can get challenging, you know, but, uh, for our community, for the Medford that we all love, let cooler heads prevail and, uh, let's get the budget and do it, uh, do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13226.426s">And</a> I, and I just would like to, uh, hopefully it's a hybrid if we can do it in a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13230.63s">And,</a> uh, as far as both sides of the issue, I understand, I understand both sides of the issue, but I cannot state loud enough the value of <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13240.135s">having</a> a meeting with people once it's safe to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13244.359s">So</a> I would encourage you, would strongly encourage you guys to try to do some sort of hybrid model, because this might be another year before we're out of the woods with COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13255.609s">The</a> numbers are going up and down as we see all over the country right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13259.413s">We</a> don't know where we're gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13261.495s">The</a> city has done a tremendous job getting the, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13265.59s">the</a> PPE out there and things of that nature, working with the partners in federal and state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13270.271s">But</a> we don't know where we're going down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13272.512s">So</a> people's individual needs can be met. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13275.273s">And</a> I've always been a big person for meeting the individual needs of constituents as we all are when we're elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13282.434s">But</a> if we have both, I think it would be the best because I think the decorum, most importantly, would be brought back to a place that we can all be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13293.325s">in</a> a setting less virtual, but also virtual for the people that do have health needs that may need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13300.171s">So</a> that's all I have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13302.113s">And</a> once again, just good luck with this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13304.675s">Budget</a> time is never easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13306.62s">Back</a> in early 2000, I was around when there was a serious budget crisis when you were on the school committee council, Falco, and we worked together and we did some unique things to make sure that we mitigated some of the funds that weren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13321.987s">And</a> we did that by working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13324.128s">We</a> didn't do that by the school committee and the council, not seeing eye to eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13327.129s">We</a> did that by working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13328.982s">And</a> we were able to put out a product that was good. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13331.383s">And</a> so that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13333.644s">I</a> miss all you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13335.285s">And</a> have a good night.<h2><a

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=449.618s">City.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3041.347s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3042.307s">Good</a> evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3043.608s">My</a> name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3047.069s">And</a> it sort of seems like deja vu. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3049.951s">But,</a> Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3053.612s">You</a> know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department, this is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3062.396s">You</a> know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3069.158s">The</a> fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3081.305s">By</a> laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks, I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3090.247s">You</a> know, week after week, we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3097.188s">And</a> this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3101.449s">You</a> know, the former councilor just referred to the salaries that city councilors are paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3107.55s">You</a> guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3112.324s">The</a> collections this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3113.806s">I</a> know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3117.071s">There's</a> a lot of money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3118.493s">There's</a> over $9 million in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3121.216s">This</a> community is stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3122.939s">This</a> community is thriving, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3126.702s">And</a> I think it's about time that you take a hard vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3129.583s">You</a> spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3132.483s">You</a> spend the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3133.404s">Give</a> the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3139.505s">The</a> NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3145.646s">We</a> only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3151.008s">And</a> some of those are outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3152.068s">Correct,</a> Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3153.513s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3154.594s">So</a> to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3163.584s">And</a> I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3174.81s">And</a> I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3186.407s">And</a> it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3190.742s">in</a> Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3198.605s">And</a> very easily that could have came north on Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3202.987s">And</a> Chief Gilberti could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning and we could have had it going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3210.05s">You</a> know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women and also to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3216.033s">And</a> on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3220.169s">Go</a> up the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3221.23s">We</a> have a thriving cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3222.772s">They're</a> actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3229.779s">I</a> know Councilor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3234.502s">I</a> know that that's been on the plate up there, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3239.045s">So</a> there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3242.008s">And</a> I think if you wait one week, I think it's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3247.412s">And</a> here's the other thing, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3248.973s">We</a> heard the young lady over here and the Commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3258.66s">There</a> has been price quotations that have been sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3261.772s">They're</a> coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3267.197s">And</a> furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said, let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3277.806s">Because</a> the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and financing equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3283.571s">And</a> he was very, very good at his job doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3286.533s">But</a> here we are this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3289.883s">We're</a> looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3299.029s">preferred,</a> the preferred method, as far as the council was doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3303.151s">So</a> I just want to say, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3312.276s">You</a> know, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3315.558s">And</a> it's great being down here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3317.679s">And</a> thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2376.81s">Oh,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2377.887s">Good</a> evening, Mr. President, uh, members of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2380.47s">My</a> name is Paul Camuso, a resident of one 14 Lincoln road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2385.916s">Um,</a> thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you this evening on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2391.102s">Um,</a> as we all know, we've seen an increase in air traffic over our community and uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2397.033s">My</a> personal opinions, being this close to Boston, we're going to see things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2402.495s">That's</a> what makes us one of the components of making a great community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2406.296s">It's</a> having the proximity to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2409.377s">But</a> with that comes the responsibility of our elected officials to advocate on behalf of our residents to make sure that we can do the best that we can as far as mitigating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2421.821s">The</a> interesting part of this conversation, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2424.978s">Currently,</a> runway 15 right at Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2428.859s">They're</a> looking to, as the gentleman said, to possibly divert more of the traffic to 15 right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2435.562s">For</a> those of you that don't realize it, 15 right is the landing path when it comes over like Winchester, right over the Lawrence Memorial Hospital in the Lawrence Estates, and then over the lower part of the Fulton Heights in Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2450.751s">and</a> that will certainly increase if, um, if the changes go through, uh, I'd be remissed if I don't thank, um, the mayor as well as the city council for, um, for making sure that we have a seat at the table next week, um, at these very important meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2467.282s">I</a> think the, uh, the FAA, uh, they're more worried about safety and things of that magnitude rather than noise complaints because at the end of the day, uh, safety is their paramount, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2479.15s">uh,</a> thoughts and feelings when it comes to, um, these type of decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2483.513s">Um,</a> I'm learning a lot more about the air traffic patterns and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2486.915s">My</a> brother is a commercial pilot for a major airline that flies out of Logan airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2491.317s">And,</a> um, and, uh, like he was explaining to me, certain winds and stuff dictate the runway takes off and takeoffs and landings, uh, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2500.442s">So</a> it's not just saying we're going to bury Medford with all the noise and give Milton a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2504.624s">It</a> all depends on some, uh, extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2507.77s">As</a> someone that does like to fly to go on vacation, I would rather take the safest route out of the airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2516.653s">given</a> the nature of being in an aircraft. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2519.354s">I</a> mean, it's common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2521.175s">But</a> I just wanted to get up here and thank the Mayor, Mayor Burke, as well as the City Council on this particular matter, because I think one of the best things that we have going for us is voices of reason sitting at the table and discussing topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2537.961s">The</a> other thing I know that should be a priority of people is if we're going to get more air traffic over our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2545.28s">We</a> should be entitled to more funding to put additional measures in people's homes, similar to Winthrop, similar to East Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2554.627s">So</a> I know that that's another important piece of the puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2558.269s">And</a> I just think it's very important that we look at this as a safety issue and as well as an issue of quality of life at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2568.776s">One</a> should not trump the other, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2571.399s">but</a> I'm just a one of many citizens in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2574.96s">So</a> I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this distinguished body this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2579.522s">And</a> I look forward to seeing how this goes along and the next coming months. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2584.364s">So</a> thank you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3042.068s">Once</a> again, Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, here in our lovely community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3048.334s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3049.653s">I</a> just would like to get up and thank this city council, as well as Mayor Burke and the DPW, the safety improvements at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3057.318s">And</a> as many of you are aware, my son is a second grader at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3066.903s">When</a> you look at just those minor changes, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3070.078s">It</a> certainly changed the whole traffic patterns down there, not as far as cut-throughs and all that, but as far as people traversing Route 60, those lights are incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3080.85s">Incredible.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3081.39s">And</a> to see them go up so quickly is a testament to our local government working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3087.096s">And</a> it was just, it's really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3088.938s">I</a> know there's more long-term <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3090.626s">planning</a> that's going on in that particular area through West Medford Square and the like, but in the immediate, the immediate changes have gone over very, very big with the parents and it's certainly given us a safer environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3105.253s">So</a> I just wanted to get up and thank you all as well.<h2><a href="../2016-03-28_HPv_ePzvD5E/2016-03-28_HPv_ePzvD5E.html">Medford Constituent Services meeting March 23, 2016</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=63.115s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=64.516s">And</a> it is a pleasure to be here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=67.615s">You</a> know, early on after the mayor was elected, she put together these teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=71.797s">And</a> right off the bat, she was adamant that we make sure that we include all different areas of this community, as well as the different demographics. <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=81.522s">And</a> I think that based upon the meetings that we had, the survey that was put out and completed by over 300 residents, as well as the public meetings, I think we accomplished that task. <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=96.088s">The</a> report that the mayor is going to highlight I think is inclusive of many areas where the city as well as the different department heads can improve as well as a focus on making sure that we're here to have the needs of each and every constituent met. <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=113.251s">I</a> want to once again thank the mayor and look forward to working with her administration as we move this city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=120.172s">It's</a> been an honor to serve with my fellow members here and once again thank you Mayor Burke.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_hBLcCaD3s_8/2025-03-21_hBLcCaD3s_8.html">Medford City Council - Dec. 22, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3109.569s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3125.96s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3127.06s">Um,</a> I don't even know where to begin, you know, uh, 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3133.763s">I</a> was two years older than Councilor Lungo, you know, and, uh, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3141.427s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3143.745s">For</a> the first time, I'm speechless. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3145.026s">You</a> know, Bob, you're really a fellow that's kept me young over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3149.908s">Sometimes</a> you'd think that we were two kids getting ready to fight at Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3154.491s">But</a> in reality, we were both just fighting for what we really believed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3159.454s">And</a> that's something that I admire about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3163.816s">I'm</a> going out this evening, retiring as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3166.698s">And</a> the council's not going to be the same without you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3171.673s">I</a> respect your loyalty, your tenacious ability to fight for what you believe in, and you've certainly been passionate over your tenure on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3182.719s">One</a> thing that I really admired about you, and I was going through a similar situation at the time with my dad, was when you cared for your lovely wife, Linda, and I saw a side of you that most people didn't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3199.109s">I'm</a> sorry, I'm just talking about my dad, I get a little emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3203.81s">But</a> you really are a good-hearted guy, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3206.151s">At</a> the end of the day, and the good part about it was, I'd see you at Bocelli's or something, after a meeting, you'd still tell me how much I stink, but we could laugh about it, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3218.695s">But,</a> like I said, I'm going out tonight, we're both going out as winners, we both won by fighting for the people of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3230.759s">didn't</a> want to make it sound, I'm in good company of leaving this room tonight with another councillor that I know left his best battle on the field and you fought for what you believed in and for that you should be very proud.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5064.357s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5065.257s">That</a> was a very nice send-off, nice speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5070.679s">You</a> know, I grew up in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5073.26s">As</a> you all know, basically the only two mayors that I remember are Mayor Parikh and Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5081.623s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5083.584s">Still</a> a little emotional, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5087.767s">During</a> my last 16 years as a member of the city council, you know, I had some of the best times of my life, but also some of the toughest times of my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5098.355s">You</a> know, a few people upstairs right now looking down that I know are proud of me are my dad, that many of you knew, Al, and my grandmother. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5110.263s">You</a> know, I remember the, uh, the parties, the election night parties at my grandmother's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5116.467s">And,</a> uh, we had some fun, you know, but, uh, you know, also in 2006, I married my best friend, Janine, you know, Janine, thank you for being there for me because as, um, as Susan knows, and the rest of the spouses of the, uh, Councilors, this is a full-time job, you know, and, uh, I, I, I had the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5140.32s">I</a> had the, the word I'm looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5145.528s">I</a> had the vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5147.269s">I</a> saw that I was spending too much time actually doing this job and not enough time where it actually was important on occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5155.131s">And</a> that's at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5156.832s">Because</a> this job does take a toll upon you and more your loved ones than you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5162.914s">I'd</a> be here fighting with my friend, and I'd be getting calls at my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5167.096s">You've</a> got good supporters. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5168.056s">They'd</a> call and yell at my poor wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5171.377s">But</a> you know the stuff that goes along with this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5175.32s">And</a> for that, I'm forever grateful, honey. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5178.301s">You've</a> been there through some of my biggest struggles in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5182.464s">And</a> you're the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5183.105s">I</a> love you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5192.751s">Moving</a> ahead a little bit, a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5195.913s">Next</a> best, well, they're equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5198.918s">Best</a> thing in my life is that little guy sitting in row number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5202.26s">Little</a> Jimmy, stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5204.122s">Stand</a> up, buddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5212.547s">As</a> Bob said, this is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5214.169s">It's</a> the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5214.929s">And</a> I'm really looking forward to just getting grounded again and getting back into some sort of sense of normalcy of not being out on, it's not just Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5226.687s">It's</a> many a nights and you know the constituent service part, we have people in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5231.431s">I'm</a> only as good as the people that have supported me and got me to where I needed to be at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5235.274s">And</a> a few people that I want to acknowledge from my family is my brother John and my brother Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5249.998s">You</a> know, I was very lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5251.218s">I</a> got great in-laws and, and, uh, they do more babysitting for me to get out and to do the constituent stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5258.341s">Um,</a> and, and, uh, you know, you're going to get a little more free time on your hands now too, Jeannie and Frank, cause I'll be home a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5264.864s">So,</a> uh, so thank you for all that you've, uh, done for me and my family, um, over the years and also my brother-in-law Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5272.427s">But,</a> um, you know, my original committee, they're mostly here tonight when I decided to run for office in 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5280.593s">I</a> gathered the people that were just closest to me and near and dear. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5285.314s">And</a> that's my aunt, my campaign manager, Carol Regan, who's right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5289.616s">Thank</a> you, auntie. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5295.137s">Another</a> person who's well known in this community from Medford Youth Hockey and just a real great person is Len Galeona, who's right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5308.747s">Also,</a> someone that is on the DPW, I don't know if he's still here, but Mike Nesta, another original. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5315.644s">One</a> of the original guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5319.023s">And</a> also my pal, Jason, you know, right from the very beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5322.924s">My</a> buddy, Jason Traviglione, he was there right from the beginning with several of my other cousins, Tommy, Terry, Tony, Johnny, Joey, and Artie. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5331.988s">You</a> know, we hit the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5332.948s">And</a> I'll tell you a funny story. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5334.349s">You</a> talk about walking the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5336.209s">I'll</a> never forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5337.09s">It</a> was one of your neighbors on Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5339.351s">We're</a> passing out the first literature. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5341.511s">Guy</a> calls me over. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5342.312s">I</a> like the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5342.872s">It</a> looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5343.652s">But</a> you spelt commitment wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5345.553s">I</a> go. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5346.436s">You've</a> got to be kidding me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5347.557s">So</a> instead of passing out literature, we're running back up the hill trying to take the literature back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5352.7s">And</a> of course, like any good politician, you tell a little fib. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5357.083s">I</a> blame the printer, but it was really my fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5362.315s">A</a> few City Hall department heads that have really been there for me over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5365.878s">That's</a> Roy Belson from the schools, Mark Rumley, who's in the room in the back there, as well as the past president of the Medford City Council, Bob Mayorko. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5375.484s">You</a> know, the people that were just very helpful over the years in giving me guidance, and I want to thank them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5383.77s">You</a> know, 16 years is a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5386.552s">You</a> know, I went back and just was plugging in the years on the computer, because I knew I had to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5391.113s">It</a> seems, uh, it was in 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5393.495s">That's</a> when, uh, the big race between Al Gore and George Bush, when we didn't know who the president was. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5400.261s">That</a> seems like many, many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5402.963s">A</a> few years later or the next year we had September 11th, you know, and, um, there was also the good things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5410.969s">As</a> I was an elected official, I was able to stand here and get my picture taken with the world series trophy, a Patriots trophy, and also a Bruins trophy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5419.336s">You</a> know, that's, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5421.485s">That</a> just tells you how long 16 years is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5423.807s">And</a> 16 years is a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5425.289s">I</a> couldn't do it, 38. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5426.99s">No,</a> sirree. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5430.413s">You</a> know, as far as the councillors, I mentioned Bob Mayorko. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5432.895s">Other</a> two councillors that I served with when I first got on, it was Councilor Bill Carr, who Bill was just another good guy, and Councilor Macarena, who I served with for a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5443.024s">I</a> just want to thank them, because I know how <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5447.37s">how</a> this is sometimes on your family life and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5450.271s">So</a> it doesn't go unnoticed, the sacrifice that all the councilors here have made over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5457.512s">Michael</a> Marks, you know, when we first started out, Michael Marks and myself, we were close. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5463.813s">We</a> were in that first little block of four who made Stephanie Muccini-Burke the president of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5470.315s">And</a> we drifted apart over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5472.695s">But</a> Michael, you're a stalwart. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5474.116s">You're</a> a good kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5477.12s">You've</a> got a good career ahead of you, and it's been a pleasure to serve with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5480.422s">And</a> he said he's going to be on that side, so you ain't getting home early. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5487.826s">Ricky,</a> what else can I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5489.047s">As</a> you said, you used to drive us to Austin Prep with Ricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5492.709s">We'd</a> be driving up to Austin Prep in the morning, and like screwballs, we'd put our hand out the window when it was 30 degrees so we could keep the hand outside the window longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5500.294s">Just</a> stupid, stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5503.536s">But</a> you'd be yelling at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5506.009s">I'm</a> freezing in here, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5508.65s">But</a> you're just a great, great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5510.572s">And</a> your wife, Carol, who certainly is also a big champion behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5517.487s">Fred</a> Dello Russo, when I first ran, I didn't know if I was running for the Medford City Council or running against Fred Dello Russo, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5523.952s">Everybody</a> in this city made it a Camuso-Dello Russo race when Freddy first ran for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5529.096s">I'm</a> sure some of you remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5531.198s">And</a> so as Fred stated, it was a rocky start, but you know something, Fred? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5537.022s">Me</a> and you became best pals here, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5541.244s">This</a> guy right here, he's there for people in their time of need, but he's also been there for me, uh, as a fellow city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5547.988s">And,</a> uh, and on occasion when I get ramped up, he'd tell me, Hey, calm down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5553.851s">And</a> I'd listen to him sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5555.442s">Other</a> times there was no stopping the kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5558.243s">But</a> Fred, you know, I really value our friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5561.524s">And</a> I know we're going to be lifelong friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5563.565s">And</a> your dad also was there for me when I first ran for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5567.347s">And</a> just you come from an outstanding family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5569.487s">And</a> thank you for being my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5574.93s">Adam,</a> thank God for that English test. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5579.834s">You</a> know, Adam, uh, Adam and I have been friends for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5583.475s">You</a> know, Adam was there for me early on in my campaigns. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5586.377s">And,</a> uh, I just wish I had more time to serve with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5589.118s">But,</a> um, as I stated a little earlier, I just, uh, I'm looking forward to a little time off and, um, and having a nine to five, uh, day rather than, um, I will stay up, watch about half the city council meetings, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5602.143s">But,</a> uh, but, uh, Adam, you're, you're just a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5606.196s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn, you know, went to Medford High School with Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5612.58s">And</a> just, you're just a good kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5615.863s">You</a> also fight, I call them kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5617.544s">I'm</a> only a year older than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5619.845s">You're</a> just a great person, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5621.506s">And</a> I've watched you over the years become a good councilor, but also a mom of three children. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5629.8s">I</a> find it tough with one child being a councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5632.843s">You</a> know, you really are just, you're a stalwart, and you get out, and you really work hard, and I want to thank you for your friendship over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5642.971s">Councilor</a> Bob, I've already said it, you're a good guy, and I'm going to miss our fights, because to be honest with you, I'm going to be honest with you, and if he wasn't there and I wasn't there, the meetings would be boring. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5657.043s">Fair</a> to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5665.275s">You</a> know, a few other people that I'd just like to. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5669.23s">to</a> congratulate and thank is right over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5672.351s">These</a> two young fellas over here, George Scarpelli and John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5676.933s">I</a> know that Bob and I leave this evening, and we're leaving it in good hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5681.495s">These</a> are two guys that are coming from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5683.636s">They</a> understand the complexity of issues, and it's not always a quick, easy fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5687.958s">As</a> Councilor Dello Russo stated a little earlier, the legislative process sometimes moves a little bit slower than people would like, but at the end of the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5699.25s">This</a> city's in good hands with the people coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5703.631s">Being</a> that person that just drives the DPW crazy over the years, I saved the best for last. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5710.373s">The</a> DPW, people don't realize the work that they do on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5715.874s">They're</a> not only dealing with the stuff when they get in in the morning that they have the long list of stuff, but they're dealing with seven city councillors calling them, they're dealing with residents calling them, they're dealing with the mayor's office calling them, they're dealing with just <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5726.818s">They</a> stop to get a cup of coffee and people are yelling and screaming, and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5731.044s">You</a> know, people don't realize that the snow plowing, they think that after the DPW plows the snow away from their driveway, that they just come by to get a chuckle and put it back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5740.757s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5741.198s">It's</a> to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5743.881s">It's</a> a job that you do very, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5747.943s">And</a> Steve Tanagli is in the back of the room, and he works as well with Mike Nestor and Paul Gere, who's our current commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5755.206s">And</a> thank you guys for meeting my individual needs, because I have always taken this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5761.769s">You</a> know, the big issues are going to be debated here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5764.21s">It's</a> the one by one is how you build friendships, relationships, and how you build bonds that you'll have forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5773.274s">Councilor</a> mocks Carol Bailey who was one of my closest friends over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5777.696s">I</a> met her her son is in college now He's ready to graduate and I met her when Michael mocks called me because she had one of those funky streets in West Medford Hercroft Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5786.239s">It</a> was the year Michael left the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5789.512s">Half</a> of the street went to the Gleason School. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5791.613s">If</a> you live right next door, you went to the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5795.116s">And</a> through Councilor Marks, I was able to build a bond by helping out Carol and her son remain at the Gleason School or get into the Gleason School. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5803.001s">And</a> one by one, that's how you build a good group, a good following behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5809.546s">And</a> I just can't say enough about the DPW because they're great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5815.79s">If</a> we can get a hand for those guys because they really are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5826.344s">The</a> last two people I just want to acknowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5831.846s">I've</a> got the wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5834.647s">You'll</a> laugh, I've got to make sure, because I'll never hear the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5839.629s">The</a> last two people I'd like to acknowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5841.69s">There's</a> one other person that's retiring at the end of this year with Councilor Bob and myself, and that's Mayor Mike McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5849.213s">People</a> seem to think that I've just got this rosy, great relationship with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5853.615s">People</a> don't realize how much we battle behind the closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5856.617s">And,</a> you know, and even Councilor Pente, I think you'd say the same about Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5862.375s">You</a> know, you can battle and battle, but he always tried to do what's right for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5867.376s">He's</a> been a great mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5868.776s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5869.297s">If</a> he wasn't doing something right, he wouldn't be the mayor overwhelmingly for 28 consecutive years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5874.638s">So</a> when you keep that into perspective, the man is retiring, the man's going to spend more time with his family, but I personally want to thank him for his years of service and the invaluable things he taught me over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5889.061s">So</a> Mike McGlynn, good luck in your retirement as well if you're out there watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5892.662s">You</a> know, it's sort of like some of those old TV shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5895.104s">No</a> one watches, but everyone knows what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5897.126s">He</a> still says he never watches it, but I think he's full of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5899.828s">I</a> think he watches the council meetings, and he just says that, oh, I heard of this or that, but I think he's watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5905.633s">And</a> if you are watching, Mr. Mayor, you've done a hell of a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5908.315s">It's</a> been a good ride, and best of luck to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5918.041s">The</a> next individual and in the last individual that I just want to recognize this evening, you know There was a race for mayor in this community the first time in 28 years and that's a long time 28 years it was former mayor Parika And then it was mayor Mike McGlynn for 28 years and in the new mayor-elect, you know as I stated <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5942.584s">Mayor-elect</a> Burke has been a former member of this Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5947.185s">And</a> you know, I hope that I'm saying this, but you know, people say, well, when she went to the mayor's office, she didn't do this or wasn't responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5958.287s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5959.187s">People</a> got to understand, she worked for another individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5962.468s">She</a> worked for another individual that called all the shots in that office, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5966.965s">So</a> I really think that this city is in good hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5970.248s">As</a> Councilor Penta said, there wasn't a mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5972.71s">It</a> was a very close election, but the people have spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5975.553s">And</a> I think this is the time that we all have to get behind the new administration and work to make Medford a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5981.258s">Because</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5982.078s">She's</a> in a position now where she can make things happen and not being the director of budget and personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5987.883s">And,</a> um, and for that, and last but not least, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5991.222s">During</a> this campaign, I was able to spend a lot of time with her and her family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5995.526s">And</a> I just got to see a side of them that I necessarily didn't over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5999.869s">And</a> other than my dad, my dad always loved her as a Councilor because she was sharp and she didn't speak all the time on every issue, but she knew the vote she was taking and was very smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6011.579s">So</a> I relied upon my dad's <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6018.158s">thoughts</a> over the years, and Stephanie Burke, you're gonna be a hell of a mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6023.604s">I</a> know you got big shoes to fill, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6026.487s">You</a> surround yourself with good people, be open-minded, and just always doing the right thing, and this community's going to prosper. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6034.735s">And</a> for anyone out there that may think differently, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6038.078s">Give</a> her a shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6038.959s">There's</a> always two years from now, you can take a look or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6041.983s">But</a> I have the utmost faith in knowing her brains, her intelligence, and her compassion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6048.05s">Because</a> in this job as mayor, you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6051.204s">And</a> this is very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6052.245s">I</a> admire the both candidates for mayor, because early on in the race, there were some things that made me ponder and say, I'm glad I didn't run for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6060.093s">And</a> that was when you had to make major personnel decisions based upon actions of people that may have did something within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6067.34s">The</a> mayor's office is a job that you're actually the CEO of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6072.843s">You're</a> saying people may not have a job tomorrow based upon some of their actions or based upon circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6080.888s">And</a> so you need to be, you need to have a lot of different characteristics for that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6087.112s">But</a> Stephanie, I look forward to, and the mayor-elect is here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6091.836s">If</a> you could please just take a bow. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6103.789s">But</a> I just want to thank everyone for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6109.392s">And</a> I know she texted me 30 times before, because I had to go get flowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6113.634s">But</a> I'd like my son and my wife to come up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6116.135s">And</a> I got little flowers for you, Whole Foods, but Dorico McGlynn was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6165.471s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6166.412s">Hey,</a> go ahead, ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6167.893s">What</a> did you just ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6168.594s">I</a> want you to know what I got him.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6174.038s">Yeah,</a> two more days. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6174.838s">Santa's</a> coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6175.899s">But</a> on an all serious note, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6178.621s">This</a> has been a hell of a ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6180.262s">And</a> I just want to thank everyone for coming here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6184.413s">for</a> me just because this is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6187.256s">You</a> know, you look around this room and there's 150 years worth of family and everything else, right James? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6194.523s">So</a> God bless everyone and Merry Christmas and good luck to the new city council, the new school committee and the new mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6201.51s">Let's</a> move this city in the right direction and I'll be on the sidelines watching.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6233.93s">One</a> last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6236.112s">After</a> I got here and I put the people that helped me get here, it's the citizens of Medford, it's the citizens of Medford that I owe a big thank you to because without them, none of this would have been possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6247.361s">So</a> thank you Medford and good night.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8924.069s">Just</a> one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8925.57s">We</a> say there was a flood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8927.031s">If</a> so, what teachers were not reimbursed and where was this flood? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8931.554s">In</a> a flood at the Roberts and a flood at the McGlynn over the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8934.836s">In</a> specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8935.276s">Do</a> the teachers have not been reimbursed for their own personal money putting out there?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8940.878s">Well,</a> we should want to look into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8943.319s">Can</a> the council at least give us the names after so we can get the superintendent to look at this as soon as possible?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8950.083s">You</a> don't want to say it on the floor, though, because obviously you don't want to throw the teachers out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8955.226s">How</a> many teachers in total on this?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8960.528s">And</a> when was this flood recently?

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8768.272s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8768.773s">I</a> believe the matter was reported to the school committee last evening, late in the meeting, but they actually negotiated a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8777.751s">with</a> the cafeteria workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8779.032s">So</a> Councilor Penta is, in fact, not correct.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9267.413s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9268.594s">Um,</a> first of all, um, just a couple of minor corrections. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9272.357s">The</a> school department has not ran on a deficit the last, I would say, at least five years, as long as I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9277.339s">We</a> have Louise Miller here who can verify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9279.86s">The</a> councillor stated that a million dollars overrun last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9283.242s">We</a> haven't bailed them out, I would say, since 2004 or 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9288.264s">That's</a> probably the last time that they had to be bailed out, and it was during tough economic times. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9293.386s">The</a> second thing is, this was done actually in open session, because I saw the same point where the cafeteria workers were discussed, so that was not true as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9302.361s">The</a> last thing is, I think the sketchy part of this whole thing is someone's talking about negotiation and legal matters out of executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9311.605s">I</a> mean, that should be investigated. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9313.185s">Obviously,</a> the councillor has her ear to the ground and someone is reporting to her about executive session stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9318.347s">Until</a> that is approved at the next regularly scheduled meeting, the minutes and stuff, it's not something I think, I mean, that's the sketchy part of this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9326.13s">So</a> maybe we could ask the superintendent of schools to maybe look into that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9330.677s">With</a> that being said, I'm being facetious on that, but obviously there's a purpose for executive session, and that's for negotiation and legal matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9342.367s">And</a> that's to discuss the pay raises, negotiation, legal matters, whether the teachers, the custodians, the secretaries get a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9354.216s">So</a> like I said, obviously there was a lot discussed last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9359.475s">in</a> negotiation and legal matters, as it appeared to be after the fact when it was back in open session. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9367.38s">So</a> I just wanted to point those few things out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9369.261s">The</a> biggest thing was, though, that the school department has not been a million dollars in deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9374.044s">I'm</a> glad to see the two new Councilors over there shaking their head, because they know the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9379.247s">They've</a> been around for quite some time, and that has not been overrun in at least, at least, I would say, six or seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9385.971s">I</a> don't want to go any further, because I know there was a rough patch where <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9389.524s">We</a> did have to bail them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9390.385s">I</a> believe it was before Louise Milleville. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9392.627s">And</a> Louise, you've been here how many years now? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9394.99s">Four</a> years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9396.031s">So,</a> but I think that those few factual things I just wanted to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9401.396s">Here's</a> the other thing, last but not least. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9402.998s">I</a> don't know much about the position, but a lot of people have been talking about we have to make the Medford Public Schools more attractable to people and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9413.396s">And</a> if this is a public relations, it's going to get people back from charter schools, get people back from maybe Minuteman, from other schools that we're actually doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9421.898s">I</a> mean, this position could pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9424.039s">But</a> like I said, as I have in all matters, since I've been on this city council, I do believe the school department and the school committee are tasked by the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9436.322s">And</a> if it's something that they're saying they need, then I support it wholeheartedly.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9561.876s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9563.757s">I</a> would just hope that this doesn't have to do with other unions and union leadership that may be bucking up at the school system, whether the secretary's union wants this in <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9573.906s">association</a> or other unions, because that certainly could be a person of the general... I want to use my wording correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9587.854s">A</a> person of the general mind could think that this is the union issue, similar to the Teamsters that we just talked about a few minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9596.619s">But</a> with that being said, I just want to say if the school committee and the school department <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9601.957s">I</a> think it's needed, and I support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9603.718s">They</a> were elected by the citizens of Medford, as were we. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9609.203s">Very</a> good, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10356.269s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10357.61s">I</a> would be remissed if I didn't say a few words about this gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10362.014s">You</a> know, when I came on the school committee scene back in 1999, I didn't really know Mr. Fresa. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10369.74s">But</a> when I met him, he was one of those guys that you pick up the phone, you make sure you go see, like Paul Kavanaugh, Honorable Justice Adam Alden, and just a real, real nice guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10382.35s">I</a> had the opportunity of getting close with Mr. Fresa <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10385.317s">through</a> my wife's uncle, Bob Mayorko. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10388.659s">And</a> so for the past 10 or 12 years, serving with Uncle Bob here on the city council, I got pretty close with Mr. Frazer to the point where I'd have coffee on Sunday nights once in a while with him and Justice Kavanaugh down at Brigham's. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10404.589s">And</a> just a real good guy, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10407.471s">But</a> when I got the call this morning, it's one of those things that you just didn't want to believe, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10412.84s">because</a> just this past weekend he was out and about, stopping shop, doing his shopping with former President Mayocko and just a really good guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10424.023s">I'd</a> also like to acknowledge, you know, Bob Mayocko was very, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10431.278s">to</a> Mr. Frazer, especially after he couldn't drive anymore and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10435.019s">Just</a> a real gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10436.079s">I</a> mean, you didn't see Al if you didn't see Paul Kavanaugh or Bob Mayorko on his arm. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10442.381s">So</a> for that, I'm sure that the Frazer family is very appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10447.263s">Where</a> Al's family, a lot of them were out of town, but he certainly had his Medford family. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10453.925s">And</a> I know I'll miss him over at Bob and Cheryl's house on some of the holidays and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10459.386s">So</a> may he rest in peace.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_IK8caXY8nKg/2025-03-21_IK8caXY8nKg.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 1, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1072.132s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1072.673s">And</a> thank you guys for coming down this evening, Mr. Daley, with your whole entourage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1078.617s">Just</a> a quick couple of questions on the bus stop relocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1081.799s">It</a> appears that the bus stop, the three options are going across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1085.442s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1120.436s">But</a> the bus stop itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1122.103s">Those</a> red dots that you have are actually across the street.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1140.593s">Can</a> you explain to people like myself that can't read construction maps, because it's very technical, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1148.039s">Whereabouts</a> are the three options so the viewing public will know? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1151.462s">Basically,</a> in layman's terms.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1158.947s">In</a> the middle of the overpass? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1160.588s">Underneath.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1162.61s">Lighting</a> will be approved and everything else if that happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1165.772s">I</a> have not looked into that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1168.893s">It's</a> docked there until you guys started. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1171.715s">Now</a> you have trucks under there with the lights at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1173.496s">So</a> that's, yeah, that's a, but you can't count that as a construction is not on for a day then. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1179.299s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1179.58s">So</a> that's the first location. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1180.94s">Next.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1192.247s">So</a> if you come from the restaurant and take a right, I'm assuming it's either on the left side of the street or on the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1199.2s">All</a> three proposed stops are on the same side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1201.921s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1202.621s">If</a> you're in front of the restaurant, you come up to the westbound on-ramp to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1206.722s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1207.342s">You</a> take a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1208.863s">Now</a> you're facing West Medford, down Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1211.964s">Is</a> it on your left or on your right compared to the restaurant? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1214.944s">If</a> you were standing at the very beginning of the ramp, it would be immediately to your left. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1219.246s">To</a> your left. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1219.846s">So</a> you'll actually have to cross the on-ramp to Route 16 eastbound to get to the bus stop from the existing location.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1244.757s">So</a> you're gonna have to walk by the work zone to get to the bus stops underneath the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1248.699s">If</a> you go there, you're just very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1251.32s">Forget</a> about the construction maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1252.6s">I'm</a> having a hard time.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1262.745s">So</a> where's the restaurant? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1265.426s">The</a> restaurant's not in the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1266.546s">I'll</a> get both points out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1267.407s">Because</a> I think we're all a little puzzled by looking at that map.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1301.007s">This</a> is the westbound on-ramp, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1303.898s">So</a> you'd cross the street and the crosswalk, and it would be right there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1307.621s">You</a> walk a little bit further on it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1326.017s">So</a> it's probably 50 feet from the existing bus stop, maybe a little more, 75? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1329.5s">A</a> little more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1332.045s">Could</a> you walk over the bridge?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1341.711s">That's</a> what I thought, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1342.711s">It's</a> about 500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1343.672s">500</a> feet, that's a lot for a senior citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1347.734s">We're</a> open to any suggestions, we'll put it wherever you want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1350.476s">Well</a> the problem is, we didn't even know it was an option at this point because the communication inside of this building <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1357.228s">is</a> certainly, there's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1359.87s">November</a> 18th, and trust me, I know how the MBTA and DOT work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1364.534s">You</a> guys are very good at notifying the community on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1368.697s">So</a> there's something else going on once it hits the network within City Hall, shall we say, the internal memos within City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1376.644s">But</a> this is the first we're hearing about the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1379.967s">So</a> I can understand the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1381.568s">They're</a> probably coming up with a game plan which is the best, according to the professionals, the chief of police, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1386.915s">OCD,</a> DPW, and then bringing it to the council for final approval, where we're the approving authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1393.017s">But</a> like you said, we were under the impression the bus stop was going to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1397.898s">But</a> that leads to my second question. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1400.718s">A</a> work zone right in front of the restaurant, that's a bigger concern as far as the restaurant, the insurance company, the real estate agent, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1411.695s">What</a> do you, when you define original?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1426.219s">So</a> if someone parks on, for lack of a better word, the old ring road or whatever, what do you call it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1432.4s">Clipper,</a> Clipper ship drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1436.382s">I</a> think that's what it's, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1439.427s">So</a> for lack of a better word, if you park on Clipper ship drive, you're still going to get access to the restaurant, the insurance company. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1445.528s">You</a> could still walk across the street and get on the sidewalk and then get in the restaurant, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1449.549s">It's</a> not going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1450.349s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1450.709s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1451.19s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1451.47s">When</a> you said work zone, I was just a little, uh, well, yeah, we, we can't have vehicles there though because so basically the barriers are just going to basically divert the road out towards because all the traffic coming towards Medford square from South Medford now is going to go over the new bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1467.472s">And</a> the traffic coming from Salem Street is now going to be diverted out, away from the restaurant, down to South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1476.659s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1477.639s">And</a> when you say work zone, it's nothing more than a diversion of 20 feet out, 30 feet out, 40 feet out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1483.764s">OK,</a> I feel a lot comfortable now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1487.386s">When</a> you said a work zone, I was figuring fences up, and those guys couldn't get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1491.89s">I</a> know Mr. Veneziano wouldn't be happy about that particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1497.15s">With</a> that being said, I just, I want to thank Mr. Daly and his staff too, because, uh, they, they, they obviously have been doing this communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1504.938s">The</a> breakdown has been from within the walls of this very building that we sit in this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1510.724s">So,</a> um, so if you could just keep notifying and, and, um, and I like councilor Dello Russo's idea, the green line, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1520.452s">I</a> mean, they've been keeping us abreast of the progress of that, probably weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1525.655s">Between</a> the DOT and the Mass Gaming Commission, I've never met two agencies that notify more on a consistent basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1534.922s">And</a> that's something, as far as transparency, I'm very happy about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1539.805s">The</a> only thing the Green Line hasn't shared with us is their finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1543.527s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1545.369s">And</a> hopefully, on a lighter note, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1547.829s">I</a> believe that's going to be in about a month or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1549.831s">They're</a> going to come out with the actual report. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1552.253s">Is</a> that fairly correct on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1554.534s">So</a> I read that in today's Globe, but you can't take the Globe and everything else for 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1561.12s">But</a> with that being said, if you could just please keep the notifications coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1564.723s">I'm</a> going to reach out to Mr. Daley tomorrow, give you some additional email addresses to get on the external communique. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1573.67s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1574.21s">And</a> one other person that has been <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1576.857s">Uh,</a> pretty good with this and put me in touch with different, um, agencies regarding the DCR and some of the other stuff going on there has been representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1584.898s">So,</a> um, I know early on in this project back in June and July, there was a concern about the, um, environmental and the river and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1592.92s">And,</a> uh, rep Donato, uh, put, uh, put the constituents from South street in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1599.001s">So,</a> um, that, uh, that's always a good avenue of communications on, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1605.376s">for</a> those people, too.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2539.198s">Yes,</a> Mr. Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2540.271s">I'd</a> like to take 15-432 off the table and receive it and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2546.333s">The</a> MassDOT was here this evening and that was for them to appear.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3355.071s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3355.691s">Um,</a> and I was going to basically make that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3357.913s">They</a> actually met before the city council met last week and the paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3363.25s">is</a> to move it from the account he's asking on the other part. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3366.913s">So</a> the proper thing, I think, as one voting member of the council, is to move the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3373.157s">And</a> I think we made it loud and clear at previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3376.859s">We</a> wanted it to come out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3378.56s">But</a> obviously, based upon the data before us, they took that vote last week prior to our committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3385.885s">So</a> on this particular paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3389.401s">I'm</a> going to not withdraw my motion for approval, because in the sense, in essence, what Councilor Penta is asking to do is take more money out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3397.427s">So</a> we have to take this to get to this point now anyway, so.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6159.396s">There's</a> obviously some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6162.037s">Why</a> don't we send this to the committee of the whole where we can have the department heads there? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6166.52s">Cause</a> it's, I just, there's some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6169.122s">So</a> I would make that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6170.082s">I</a> would draw a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6172.504s">Motion</a> to send it to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6174.385s">Councilor</a> Lococo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6450.375s">This</a> one here, uh, the city is pursuing litigation for the money that they feel is owed to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6456.138s">Um,</a> we have to pay this and move approval at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6591.446s">Contradictory.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7201.83s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7203.591s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7204.832s">This</a> is just a friendly reminder for anyone over 65 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7209.575s">In</a> the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we're the only state that has a law that exempts senior citizens from having to pay for a fee to use <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7222.772s">So,</a> if senior citizens see a fee on their bill for 411 directory assistance calls, it's usually $2.49. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7228.877s">If</a> you see that, give a call to Comcast at 855-270-0379. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7232.299s">Could</a> you repeat that, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7233.58s">1-855-270-0379.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7234.021s">And</a> Verizon is 1-800-974-4111. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7250.873s">6-0-0-6,</a> and you can get the forms, fill them out, and you can be exempted that fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7257.794s">So</a> I know it's not a lot of money, but $2.50 a month for an entire year, it's certainly something for a senior citizen that's on a fixed income, and just want to spread the word on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7269.857s">I'd</a> like to see more people take advantage of it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7683.105s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7684.386s">I</a> would be remiss if I didn't congratulate the gentleman on his appointment as vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7690.212s">And</a> sometimes people forget a community like Medford has over 500 members of the local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7696.739s">We</a> disposed of the matter.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_ptMnNu2KUwo/2025-03-21_ptMnNu2KUwo.html">Medford City Council - Nov. 24, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=760.765s">On</a> the motion approved by Councilor Knight, chair recognizes Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=766.328s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I definitely support this this evening and I want to applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=772.772s">You</a> know, all too often everyone sits behind this rail and in other elected positions throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=779.096s">We</a> say we're father veterans and we stand proudly with the veterans on Veterans Day and on Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=785.12s">We</a> honor the sacrifice that many have made. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=788.282s">But</a> this is a real tangible piece of <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=790.516s">legislation</a> that this council can stand behind boldly and send the message loud and clear that we're walking the walk, not just talking the talk when it comes to supporting the veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=800.243s">So</a> on behalf of the local veterans, I'd like to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up and I support it wholeheartedly.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1455.16s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1457.282s">And</a> I support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1458.664s">Thank</a> you, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1460.586s">If</a> she doesn't mind, I'd like to make a B paper that is in line with the fire department, but the new pieces of apparatus that were just purchased over the last 12 months, the rear step on the truck, unless you wear a size 4.5 shoe, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1475.787s">you</a> can't safely do your job when you have to pull hose and stuff off of the back of the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1480.669s">It's</a> about a thousand dollar part, I'm being told, I have not confirmed that, to extend the bumper so that a fire department personnel can safely stand on the rear step of these trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1493.053s">If</a> we could ask the fire chief to look into it and to get this fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1499.035s">In</a> the interest of public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1500.613s">because,</a> uh, this, this is certainly an issue I saw it firsthand down at engine two and, uh, someone's going to get injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1508.058s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1508.678s">We'll</a> do that as an amendment if it's all right.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2794.265s">Uh,</a> nope. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2794.826s">I</a> just have one another thing on the suspension and when he's done with his very good, uh, Councilor Knight.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3699.341s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3700.201s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3702.002s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3704.082s">And,</a> Jack, I certainly understand your frustration, as I indicated on the telephone earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3709.765s">I</a> believe there's a timeline that National Grid is supposed to stop digging unless it's for emergency situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3716.422s">And</a> I thought it was around November 1st or October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3722.166s">If</a> we could find out, first of all, who this gentleman George is, and secondly, once we do find out if a permit was issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3730.19s">And</a> I don't want to sit here and say we should put the whole project on hold, because I don't know if there's people on that street that are waiting for gas, for if there's leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3739.876s">I</a> don't know the circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3741.417s">But</a> to not notify the neighborhood well in advance, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3744.735s">well</a> in advance and come up with some sort of a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3748.098s">Um,</a> it's, it's mind boggling.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3786.0s">I'm</a> coming over your house for the winter then. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3788.502s">No</a> lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3788.922s">If</a> we could find out at least like, like you say, the city of Medford has control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3792.755s">the</a> permitting and as far as giving them the permission to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3797.739s">If</a> we could find out the circumstances surrounding it and we can get back to Jack tomorrow because he needs to let his neighbors know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3805.204s">I</a> know there's other people in the neighborhood that are concerned about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3808.726s">There's</a> some senior citizens that live on Dwyer and in Gordley that depend on the sidewalks and the infrastructure in that immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3818.613s">So</a> I just, I wish there was more communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3821.634s">And</a> it wasn't at four o'clock this afternoon, or earlier in the afternoon when Mrs. Coakley brought it to his attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3828.199s">But</a> if we could just get the answers and find out too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3831.981s">From</a> the engineering office? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3833.522s">From</a> the engineering office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3834.343s">And</a> if this is some upgrade for the purpose of convenience, and it's not an emergency, and it's convenience, that we do put it off until the springtime when the nice weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3847.292s">Because</a> the snow plows are going to be right behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3849.073s">They're</a> already talking about snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3850.696s">and</a> it's just going to create a problem after a problem after a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3854.74s">They</a> said gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3855.901s">So</a> if it is gas leaks, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3857.743s">I</a> mean, if it's gas leaks, it's gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3859.505s">We</a> see the stories of houses blowing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3861.146s">You</a> have to take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3862.628s">You</a> can't put the fire department or the neighborhood people in danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3865.831s">But</a> if it's not gas leaks, and it is just because they have 13 customers that want to sign up, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3871.712s">and</a> start selling gas.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3875.114s">Yeah,</a> and that was my second point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3876.615s">And</a> Jack had a very good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3879.457s">You</a> got Barry Park down the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3881.618s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3883.159s">You</a> have the new, I call it the new Dame Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3886.382s">The</a> Walnut Hill Properties owns a property there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3890.444s">If</a> maybe they would give us a couple spots, do something to alleviate the neighborhood's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3896.948s">And</a> last but not least, last but not least, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3901.405s">You've</a> got to think that between November and Christmas is not a good time to be ripping up a street that's going to last 30 days, other than an emergency situation with gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3913.15s">But</a> they knew about it two months before this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3915.231s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3927.417s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3929.097s">As</a> you know, I talk to you quite frequently and I will, uh, be updating with you tomorrow with what we can find out.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6768.77s">I</a> move suspension of the rules to clear up some of the old business on the council agenda that's been lingering since 2014 in some cases.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6882.946s">We're</a> waiting to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6883.626s">It's</a> just sitting on the agenda now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6884.846s">We</a> got the report We got a report back on that didn't we?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6926.184s">No,</a> but the solicitor has kept us updated along the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6929.485s">All</a> right, let him respond again.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7098.426s">That</a> was the money to cut the budget and then take it out of the other account. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7107.25s">The</a> budget passed.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7212.279s">I'm</a> just saying that, so if the gentleman does want to come back and appear, it's within the 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7216.862s">It's</a> right around the 90 days, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7219.684s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7220.364s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8079.041s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8081.328s">And</a> I certainly agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn's frustrations and the business owners that should have close to up to the minute what's going on with the project, especially when it affects their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8094.701s">But</a> I don't want to send out the wrong message that if the City Council votes for a cease and desist, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8099.902s">that</a> the trucks are going to pack up, they're going to leave, and there'll be no work that gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8103.544s">That's</a> just inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8104.865s">It's</a> irresponsible for us to let people think that we have the power to do that, because we do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8111.728s">Furthermore,</a> if we do delay it, if we had the authority for a cease and desist, it's only going to add additional days on the end of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8120.072s">So</a> it'll be two years and three days if we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8123.834s">So</a> as I stated, I think they have to work on their communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8129.18s">The</a> particular department that is overseeing this project, which is a state project, if not the City of Medford, the Mass Department of Transportation, as the President indicated, between them and the Gaming Commission, I'm getting emails twice a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8146.359s">with</a> updates on the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8148.26s">And</a> given that that's the same entity, MassDOT, I don't see why we can't get the same, and interested people like the restaurants, like the banks, like the auto schools and everyone else in the particular area can sign up for those alerts as well, as people along the Green Line Extension route receive weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8168.448s">So</a> if we could just ask for that, but I just don't want to send out the wrong message that a cease and desist <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8174.19s">is</a> something that we have any control over whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8177.591s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8690.475s">Councilor</a> Camuso, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8692.937s">What</a> do you think <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8694.921s">I</a> posed this to the body in the form of a resolution, having a committee of the whole and take up all papers that are in all subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8703.047s">We</a> have stuff in there from 2007 that just never dealt with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8707.631s">Or</a> they could have been acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8708.892s">They</a> could have been acted upon, exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8710.973s">I</a> looked at the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8711.854s">So</a> in other words, every time the clerk prints out the city council tracking sheet for subcommittees, committees of the whole, it's just wasting ink and paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8720.401s">Therefore,</a> I think that this, <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8722.107s">time</a> where, especially with two members of the council are moving on into retirement, it would be the appropriate time to clean up the business beforehand of this particular council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8731.956s">I</a> think it's a good idea, but whatever the council wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8736.2s">And</a> if we want to keep stuff in certain committees, you keep it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8738.562s">But</a> there is stuff that works itself out.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8749.657s">So</a> everybody has to call a subcommittee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8751.638s">So</a> the subcommittee meetings would have to be called.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8766.345s">I</a> mean, whatever procedurally we decide to do.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8774.237s">I</a> agree 100%, but I also think we have to do whatever the proper procedure is to clear up the council tracking resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8781.081s">It's</a> 17 pages long. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8782.861s">I</a> say that in a funny fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8785.423s">It's</a> not 17 pages, but it's quite lengthy, and it's stuff that we're talking about buildings that don't even exist in our community anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8792.226s">We</a> get papers, and they're talking about the DPW water building that burned down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8796.148s">The</a> water building is no longer there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8800.891s">Whatever</a> the proper procedure is, I think we should address all of it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8812.147s">If</a> not, you guys deal with it next year.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8822.234s">Do</a> you want to do it on a Friday night? <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8825.777s">No,</a> we can do it this Thursday, 10 o'clock, instead of going to Medford-Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8833.141s">Madam</a> Vice President?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_s9uJGZJhvT8/2025-03-21_s9uJGZJhvT8.html">Medford City Council - November 10, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=101.718s">Whenever</a> you're done, I'm sorry.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=103.499s">So,</a> Councilor Camuso, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=106.401s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=109.207s">As</a> we are all aware, we just met, and I joined my council colleague, Councilor Robert Penta, over the past three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=119.593s">And</a> we brought the name forward of Frederick Lasky as a member of the guiding commission to represent this honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=127.758s">And</a> I'm happy to say that it was a unanimous vote of the Medford City Council at the meeting, and I'd just like to make a motion to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=137.892s">on</a> behalf of Councilor Penta, myself and the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=141.674s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Musso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2323.418s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2324.478s">And</a> I certainly agree with all the sentiments of all of my colleagues this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2328.6s">You</a> know, this is very disturbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2331.622s">As</a> it was alluded to in prior comments, we're lucky that the only thing that happened was lassity of people's personal property and nothing more egregious. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2343.287s">And</a> just, it's very disturbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2347.689s">You</a> know, the parents are very concerned about this, and they very well should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2353.23s">I</a> think that they have to have some sort of round table. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2355.971s">I</a> know the chief of police and the police department is active in the schools, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2361.972s">We</a> actually, several years ago, there was the STARS program. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2365.773s">I'm</a> not so sure if it's still out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2367.413s">It's</a> the school threat assessment response team, and it's made up of all the area police departments and NMLAC and some of the other SWAT teams in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2376.036s">But</a> if we could just get an update too. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2379.616s">It's</a> unfortunate, but it's things, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2382.925s">of</a> this magnitude, when it happens, you sort of start thinking about other things that could possibly happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2390.25s">The</a> people that lived in the Watertown-Cambridge line never thought that there'd be a car chase in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2398.32s">involving</a> homemade grenades and bombs. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2403.261s">You</a> know, and we just have to make sure that every precaution is taken when it comes to the safety of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2409.923s">So</a> I just want to go on record in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2412.804s">And</a> this isn't something that should wait the 10 days for the mayor to get and then send off to the superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2418.886s">This</a> is something that we should get right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2421.747s">Also,</a> if we could ask the chief of police for an update, because the surveillance video <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2427.365s">that</a> they do have of the individual perpetrator, look like a pretty clear picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2432.728s">So</a> hopefully, with the public's help, if it hasn't been already, but with the public's help, they can identify and hold this person responsible, or persons responsible for this egregious behavior.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2766.917s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2769.238s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2771.466s">When</a> you look at the way the street sweeping is done in this community, there is a more intelligent way that it could be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2778.989s">First</a> of all, people still think that this is five years ago when you can just put the big pile of leaves in front of your house and they used to just come down and pick it all up. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2789.353s">Unfortunately,</a> if we remember that the equipment repair over those years when we did that was significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2799.298s">With</a> that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2800.578s">You</a> know, we have a bigger problem that we have to start thinking about, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2803.839s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello alluded to, the leaves are not even on the ground yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2809.12s">What's</a> going to happen is the streets are going to be swept. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2813.041s">The</a> leaves are going to fall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2814.541s">The</a> catch basins are going to get clogged. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2816.942s">The</a> streets are going to become a sheet of ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2818.922s">We're</a> going to have public safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2822.443s">So</a> hopefully the DPW, and they advertised the new commissioner's position the other day, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2830.464s">Hopefully,</a> we can get someone in there that can really tackle this, Mr. President, and tackle it quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2836.427s">Because</a> on the heels of street sweeping, it's snow plowing again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2840.129s">And</a> if you look back to last year's treacherous year, we're only asking for problems if we get half of the amount of snow that we got last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2852.335s">One</a> of the best pieces of equipment they own is that big snowblower that was purchased back in the 1970s or the 60s, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2857.818s">I'm</a> not even sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2860.667s">But</a> they had to take that out, get it up and running with Timmy McCarthy and the rest of the mechanics in the garage, and get that out there to widen the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2869.411s">Even</a> the small side streets, you couldn't get a fire truck down. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2872.272s">So</a> I'm just thinking ahead here, where if we start getting the catch basins clogged and icing up, we're going to have some major problems on our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2882.116s">And</a> this is late. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2883.617s">Normally,</a> the street sweeping is done even earlier than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2886.478s">But</a> unfortunately, Mother Nature and the <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2889.948s">The</a> changing colors of the leaves happen later this year, which we do not have any control of. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2896.21s">Last</a> but not least, this city council pushed far in the past to get later leaf pickup, which we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2903.093s">But</a> unfortunately, the last leaf pickup is going to be picked up before all the leaves are down. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2909.235s">So</a> that's another whole thing that we're going to be dealing with moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2913.496s">Maybe</a> if we can look at waste management, see if they can send an additional pickup as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2919.27s">after</a> most of the leaves are down. <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2920.63s">So</a> thank you for bringing this up, Councilor Knight.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_ysQghC7EzOg/2025-03-21_ysQghC7EzOg.html">Medford City Council - October 27, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=138.0s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=138.981s">And</a> I'd like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=143.303s">You</a> know, this is becoming a major problem in the West Medford area, not only for the business community, but also for the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=150.79s">And</a> unfortunately, these things over the last few weeks have been knocked down at the height of rush hour, whether it's five o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=159.734s">It</a> comes to a total gridlock every time the trains are coming by. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=163.495s">They</a> have to get the police cruisers out there, stop the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=166.277s">It's</a> just becoming a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=169.198s">I</a> think it's about time, given that it's a state road, Route 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=172.5s">that</a> the Department of Transportation has to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=176.843s">There</a> has to be a total look at that whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=179.165s">We</a> still have those things down the middle of the road that divide the road that we had to put in in lieu of the horns being blown every time a train comes by. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=189.032s">But</a> at this point, I think we have to look at a major upgrade of the entire West Medford train station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=196.018s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=198.72s">In</a> the coming few years, there's <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=202.824s">excuse</a> me, in the coming few years, there's going to be possibility down in that area for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=206.967s">Have</a> we ever looked at putting the train platform on the other side of the train tracks so that it stops behind, say, the liquor store in that area, so that it doesn't have to keep the gates down for a long time, that it stops before the gates, and then it, when it's coming from Lowell, it would go by the gate and then stop <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=226.471s">I'm</a> not so sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=227.211s">I</a> don't know if we have the room, but with all the projects going on here from the DOT and our community right now, whether it's Craddock Bridge, whether it's the Green Line, I think we have to take a serious look at the West Medford train station because it is becoming a nuisance, not only this particular matter, but just the amount of foot traffic in the area, which we encourage for environmentally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=249.388s">We</a> want to have people take the train, but at the same token, we want to have it the safest possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=254.485s">And</a> the best aesthetically pleasing that we can do as well, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=258.587s">So</a> just food for thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=261.308s">We</a> are going to have to do a big cleanup of that parking lot at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=264.81s">And</a> it may be the appropriate time to tie all this in together, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=270.905s">If</a> there's people in that immediate area that are looking to maybe sell their property, might be an opportunity for an economic development engine too, where you could actually reconfigure some of the area down there, build brand new storefronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=284.554s">There's</a> a million things you could do down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=287.636s">It's</a> over an acre of land if you take the, what is it, Stevens Auto Body? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=293.44s">The</a> West Medford parking lot and, like, that whole area, it's over an acre of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=297.562s">So</a> the development possibilities are endless. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=301.063s">So</a> it's something to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=303.264s">It</a> also abuts the Medford Housing Authority, which is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=306.365s">So</a> I think it's something long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=308.646s">We've</a> got to have a long-term vision in this community, and I think it's one area we could look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=312.447s">But</a> on the immediate concern that Councilor Caraviello brought up, I think it's something that has to be looked at sooner than later.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=718.045s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=719.205s">Um,</a> I think that this should be sent to the transportation subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=722.788s">Um,</a> there's a couple of papers in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=724.309s">Uh,</a> Councilor Penton is the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=726.612s">There's</a> one paper in there from October 2014, a year ago, to discuss bicycle safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=733.236s">And</a> that hasn't been called yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=734.737s">Maybe</a> we can put that, as well as the Craddock Bridge discussion that was supposed to take place in the Transportation Subcommittee from March. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=741.461s">Maybe</a> if we have one meeting, if Councilor Pentos thinks there's a need for it, call a meeting as the chairperson and take all three of these matters up on the same evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=752.087s">But</a> there's been quite some time has surpassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=756.828s">And</a> there's also a couple other ones on the committee of the whole regarding the bus stop down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=762.552s">Maybe,</a> do we want to move it all into the transportation subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=766.014s">I</a> don't know if we can parliamentary, but.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1400.486s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1403.163s">This</a> petition was before us last week looking for action on the bollards, actually a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1408.63s">And</a> this council was pretty vocal getting the bollards done in a quick fashion from the meeting moving forward, not a quick leading up to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1420.783s">Obviously,</a> we're all aware that somewhat created World War III down there, as you just alluded to, the businesses and the neighbors and there's a lot of friction right now and there's some animosity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1434.949s">being</a> thrown at some certain members of this city council, too, which is unfair, because council has fought for what they believe was the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1441.714s">But</a> I think once and for all, maybe we slow these modifications down, the loading zone and the bus stop, and get in a traffic engineer that actually we can pay, the city can pay, and they can look at it and find out what the safest, the most business-friendly solution <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1462.376s">is</a> that certainly will help the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1465.458s">Because</a> the chief of police, the DPW commissioner, Cassandra up in engineering, they're all very good professionals at what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1474.183s">But</a> only a traffic engineer can come in and tell us that, hey, you're going to get the best impact, the safest cutout in the curb is in this spot here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1484.969s">That</a> the loading zone should actually be at this spot here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1489.251s">And</a> if we spend $5,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1491.419s">for</a> a consultant to come in here and give us an actual framework on what the best solution is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1498.641s">At</a> that point, it's totally on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1501.102s">It's</a> not the neighbors against the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1503.063s">It's</a> not the businesses against the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1505.243s">It's</a> the city taking the leadership role and taking the ball right out of your court, so to say, and doing what is needed in that immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1514.546s">Because</a> I can tell you right now, there's already a lot of animosity about this current paper on here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1519.748s">And</a> it hasn't even been heard yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1521.46s">until</a> about five minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1524.923s">So</a> with that being said, I think we should put the brakes on and ask the mayor to bring in a traffic engineer and come up with a solid plan that no one can be blamed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1536.391s">Because</a> quite honestly, as I said last Wednesday, when those bollards went in, I spoke to several city councilors and the phones were ringing off the hook to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1546.243s">And</a> quite honestly, I don't even think that's over yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1549.204s">There</a> may be some legal action with those bollards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1553.425s">Businesses</a> feel that the city shouldn't have come in and did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1557.786s">But</a> that's a situation for our law department to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1561.627s">So</a> with that being said, I just think the professionals need to come in and make these determinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1567.808s">And</a> quite honestly, if we're getting them in here, we should have them maybe in West Medford look too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1573.15s">Bargain</a> spot lickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1575.285s">Right</a> now, they're a little upset with the parking lot closing down in a few weeks, where they have no parking in front of their store. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1585.767s">Maybe</a> we look at some of these squares as a whole, including Medford Square, and have a traffic engineer tell us, tell the city representatives where these bus stops should be, and not moving them because someone picks up the phone and haphazardly calls us and asks us to move a bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1601.63s">We</a> can make an educated <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1603.193s">decision</a> on it based upon fact and not hearsay and people's personal preferences. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1610.159s">Because</a> one thing I know about this, it's like permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1612.641s">You</a> do this street, and they love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1614.943s">The</a> next street now starts, it's the trickle-down effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1617.585s">And</a> you do that, it's the same thing with bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1619.727s">You</a> put it in front of one business, and then the bank gets upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1623.209s">And</a> then you move it from the bank, and the next store gets upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1626.712s">So</a> if we could look to hire a traffic engineer, I just think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1631.863s">It's</a> the most professional way to proceed at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1707.604s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1712.86s">The</a> two papers that are before us are to move a bus stop, and then the second one is to possibly the amendment was to add a loading zone, loading dock, loading zone area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1722.364s">That's</a> not going to affect pedestrian traffic at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1725.106s">Those</a> are both on the main street and not the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1728.827s">So</a> I'm just not really hearing how it's going to affect the pedestrian traversing.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1751.494s">Well,</a> with all due respect to the Councilor, the trucks are blocking a street and a sidewalk that are not even on the bus route, and they were asking for a loading zone to be placed on Main Street and not Harvard Street, because there isn't the room on Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1766.184s">You</a> couldn't get two trucks by if one truck was parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1768.806s">And</a> with the bollards now, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1770.748s">They</a> can't do that if you put one more, like you said, down at what, 259? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1775.351s">Did</a> you say 259 Harvard Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1777.113s">You'd</a> like to see the bollards go down to? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1779.434s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1779.574s">Which</a> was the address you said on Harvard? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1782.656s">215,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1783.097s">So</a> 215. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1786.379s">So</a> as I stated, the pedestrians traversing these bus stops moving in a quick fashion in the loading zone does not affect the pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1794.465s">Dealing</a> with the problem at hand on Harvard Street <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1798.004s">We'll</a> do that, but I think we're making some progress with the bollards, but they have to be extended.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2334.597s">And</a> this evening, as I suggested, we send this to the Subcommittee on Transportation because the paper before us by Councilor Penta is to move the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2344.204s">And</a> for us to do anything without, as you stated and as Mr. Silva stated, you want to work together, everyone should be at that table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2352.807s">as</a> the last process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2353.767s">So</a> the appropriate subcommittee is the transportation subcommittee where these things can be hashed out collectively and as well take up some of the stuff that's been left over hanging in there from 2014 and early 15 that has not been addressed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2368.391s">Maybe</a> we can have like a marathon meeting and get some of it cleared up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2376.834s">That's</a> not my committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2378.014s">That's</a> not my committee.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2804.027s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2805.427s">I</a> want to thank my colleague, Councilor Penta, for putting this on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2809.668s">We</a> all know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2810.809s">Castagnetti.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2812.191s">just</a> a wonderful person a great teacher in our community and of course her husband who's not only a biggest biggest fan of all the city councillors, but also a friend of my aunt Carol, so just want to want to congratulate you and your lovely wife for this honor and thank you for councillor Penta for Bringing it up this evening giving her the recognition that she deserves Thank You Councilor Councilor Marks
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3537.328s">Thank</a> you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3539.289s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3540.07s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3541.17s">And</a> this isn't about statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3544.692s">This</a> isn't one in 30, one in 60, one in 10, one in five. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3548.734s">This</a> is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3550.195s">It's</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3550.962s">If</a> it's one person in the city of Medford that we can help save their life and put them in the right direction, then we support it or we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3558.585s">We're</a> all entitled to our vote this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3561.026s">The</a> statistics, as far as I'm concerned, are semantics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3565.788s">This</a> is something good that the Medford City Council can get behind to save one life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3571.705s">One</a> life is enough, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3574.047s">You</a> know, you go up to Medford High School, you go to Somerville High School, you go to Woburn High School, you go to any number of high schools around here, and the kids will tell you, it's easier to get pills than it is to buy a case of Budweiser down at the liquor store. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3584.754s">It's</a> easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3587.276s">It's</a> easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3589.257s">So,</a> when there's a paper like this before us, and of course, on first face value, when I got my packet this weekend, I reached out and I discussed this with Councilor Knight, and just, I wanted to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3601.125s">that</a> kids that are suffering with terminal ill cancer, kids that are suffering with diseases that are going to ultimately be fatal, whether there is still mechanisms in place that they can be prescribed the needed doses of pain medication so that they can die with dignity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3621.46s">And</a> in my little research I did this weekend, there is many. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3625.843s">Whether</a> it's Dilaudid, whether it's morphine, there are other substances out there that can <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3631.267s">be</a> used, but I think this is a positive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3635.268s">Just</a> look at collectively as a city council, this council as a whole, all seven of us stood in unity a year ago to push for the hiring of a full-time substance abuse coordinator for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3650.513s">We</a> stood strong <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3652.831s">And</a> the mayor took our collective recommendation from all seven members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3659.072s">That</a> is in effect today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3660.433s">We</a> didn't hire a full-time $80,000 a year salaried position that had unanimous support from the seven members of this council and the city administration because topics that we're talking about right now are not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3673.395s">It's</a> a major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3674.735s">This</a> is something we can get behind on the ground level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3677.936s">We</a> can be, and I get passionate about this obvious for obvious reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3682.513s">You</a> know, but if we can get behind this and it can save one life, one life, then as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the best votes we can take as a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3691.841s">We</a> were arguing about bus stops a half hour ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3693.983s">We</a> were arguing about other stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3697.286s">This</a> is the real deal stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3699.148s">And</a> I ask my colleagues to all support this this evening in the interest of saving one life here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3705.313s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4454.258s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4455.338s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4457.079s">If</a> I may, if Councilor Knight and the President would allow me just to give a brief update of the Middlesex District Attorney Opiate Task Force that I was appointed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4467.262s">Just</a> real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4469.723s">The</a> task force is really getting into this epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4476.845s">Just</a> to give a quick background, it's leaders that Middlesex District Attorney Marion Ryan has put together of <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4483.505s">It's</a> law enforcement, health care providers, doctors, nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4487.047s">The</a> two lead hospitals are Hallmark Health and the Leahy Clinic's conglomerate out of Burlington, policy makers and elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4497.371s">One</a> of the key doctors that brings a lot of the science and the statistics to it is Dr. O'Connor out of Middlesex Recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4504.574s">He</a> has quite a very, very interesting story. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4508.636s">And</a> he's bringing the science behind addiction so that people can understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4513.85s">One</a> of the big pieces is the task force is working on the stigma, the stigma that people that are addicted to drugs are given. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4522.956s">And</a> unfortunately, it's easy to forget that they're human beings that are dealing with issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4530.981s">And</a> that's being worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4533.063s">Two</a> big things that I found very interesting, dentists, dentist officers and <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4540.843s">What's</a> the other one that's back here, where they do the root canals?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4547.328s">Oral</a> surgeons, yeah, and endodontists are a major area where people get these pills. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4554.473s">Second</a> thing that I would never even think of, the Middlesex DA's office is working with the realtors in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4560.477s">You</a> have open houses on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4562.138s">People</a> come through the house looking at the house, oh, beautiful home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4565.04s">They</a> go into the bathroom, they open up the medicine cabinet, Oxycontin sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4570.307s">These</a> are things that you'd never think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4574.668s">So</a> the education piece is getting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4577.248s">Hallmark</a> Health has been a leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4579.649s">They're</a> doing a study right now on back pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4582.049s">Anyone</a> that goes into the emergency room with back pain, the most that they can be prescribed is 72 hours worth of pain medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4590.471s">And</a> then it's up to them to go to their primary care and actually get good follow up on the source of their pain and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4599.96s">What</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4601.381s">Middlesex</a> district attorney is working with the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4604.542s">Representative</a> Donato is on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4607.503s">With</a> Senator Lewis out of Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4609.543s">Middlesex</a> DA has a bill right now to limit to 72 hours supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4614.105s">It's</a> a bill that's going to be heard this legislative session, 72 hours supply of <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4621.566s">opiate</a> pain medication out of the emergency rooms, once again, until you see your specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4625.809s">So</a> it's real good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4628.27s">Just</a> this last meeting, addicts that are in recovery were brought in and talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4633.993s">And</a> it was young mothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4635.754s">Young</a> mothers, you would never in a million years think that these people were addicted to heroin or other opiates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4642.979s">And</a> it's just amazing hearing their stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4645.42s">And</a> it's educating the people in that room that can make a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4651.057s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4653.518s">If</a> anyone else has any specific questions regarding that task force, please feel free to ask me and at least we'll put you in touch with someone that can answer other specific questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4662.381s">But</a> the Middlesex DA, Marion Ryan, really is taking a leadership role on this in the county. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4667.843s">It's</a> the second of two task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4669.224s">The</a> other one is in Northern Middlesex County, which is Lowell and Bill Ricker and up near that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4674.626s">But</a> this is something that I'm honored to serve on because <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4682.124s">working</a> collectively, if we can work collectively as elected officials in this room and with the DA's office, with Representative Donato and Senator Jalen and the other representatives, and get the right data into the hands of the people that can make a difference up on Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4698.333s">Governor</a> Baker just came out with his bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4701.595s">Very</a> impressive, some of the stuff in his bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4704.077s">So</a> this is something, and it's nonpartisan, because addiction does not discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4710.485s">There's</a> no Democrat next to an addict. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4712.086s">There's</a> no Republican next to an addict. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4716.487s">It</a> doesn't discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4717.948s">So</a> it's a work in progress, but one day at a time, hopefully you can get people the data to make these decisions and the laws change that need to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4733.073s">But</a> we're doing what we can on the ground floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4735.413s">And</a> I want to thank my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4737.235s">Because</a> this is one issue, one issue that we stood tall on, each and every member of this Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4743.578s">We</a> hit it head on collectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4745.238s">We</a> sent a strong message to the mayor that it's something that's going on in our community and we all work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4750.641s">And</a> we all should be proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4752.601s">So</a> basically, that's it, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7795.542s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7797.223s">Um,</a> as we're all aware, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7800.603s">About</a> a month, month and a half ago, I think it was, the city council, upon the recommendation of the mayor, enacted an ordinance to establish a new garden commission here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7814.991s">As</a> I did support that, and then it became law, and at this point the mayor has appointed his two individuals to become members or commissioners of the garden commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7830.634s">Upon</a> him appointing his people, Amanda Bowen, very, very active in the gardening club, reached out to city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7839.501s">And</a> at this point, we have a committee of the whole in the upcoming weeks, I'm assuming? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7844.566s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7845.627s">With</a> that being said, I would like to bring the name of Frederick Lasky forward with Councilor Penta for the commissioner that is appointed by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7860.243s">Mr.</a> Lasky has done an outstanding job down at Riverbend Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7865.347s">Many</a> a Saturday mornings when I'm down there for either soccer or T-ball with my son, we see Mr. Lasky in the garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7872.893s">He</a> does a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7875.875s">I</a> approached Mr. Lasky and asked him if he'd be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7879.14s">I</a> just think he'd be a wonderful addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7880.681s">We</a> all know his commitment to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7882.822s">You're</a> not going to find anyone, uh, that's more well respected than, um, direct Alaska. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7887.865s">So,</a> uh, I would like to respectfully put his name, uh, before the subcommittee, um, sorry, before the committee of the whole for the city council appointment on the motion of council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7985.757s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7987.397s">I'd</a> like to congratulate the distinguished gentleman to my right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7992.859s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7993.299s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, this is the first time in the Medford-Kiwanis history that the same gentleman or lady was elected president for two times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8004.541s">So</a> I want to congratulate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8006.822s">Thank</a> you.

the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1608.525s">You</a> know, this last week's debate, there was something that we haven't seen, the enthusiasm in that room for both candidates, all Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1618.33s">It</a> was just something that we haven't seen in a long, long time in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1623.848s">You</a> know, when I first got sworn in as a member of the Medford School Committee, that was the venue when Governor Salucci was out here and he swore all of us in, both school committee and city council and mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1635.297s">And,</a> you know, it was just a wonderful place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1639.18s">And</a> I remember, you look at some of the old photographs from the swearing in in 2000, and you can see just in the photographs the upgrades that have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1649.44s">since</a> the year 2000 or so at that very beautiful place that we call the Chevalier Theater in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1659.302s">You</a> know, as we left the debate and traversed Medford Square going to grab a bite to eat after, all the restaurants were packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1669.024s">Carol's,</a> Salvatore's, the overflow was down at Bocelli's and Razo's. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1673.905s">It</a> was just something that <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1676.332s">that</a> the businesses can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1680.094s">And</a> think of the meals tax that was brought in just that evening by the influx of people that were out spending their money in the squares that not necessarily come out on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1692.9s">But</a> I mean, I'm speechless. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1697.922s">You've</a> got to just really think about what that place can be, especially the colonial theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1704.168s">is</a> owned by Emerson College now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1706.15s">They</a> just took it offline for the next few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1709.173s">They're</a> not so sure where they're going to go with the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1715.159s">The</a> BU owns a theater that <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1719.069s">Not</a> really sure what they're going to do with their theatre right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1721.651s">And</a> as the premier real estate agent in our community just said, the money's not in the theatres. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1727.475s">The</a> money's in condominiums inside these theatres. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1730.938s">And</a> that's something certainly that we're not looking at here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1735.261s">But</a> as that happens throughout New England and the greater Boston area, as the gentleman spoke earlier, there's going to be a need for theatres like ours that hold 1,200 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1747.841s">And</a> as I said, the investments that have been made there as a result of Representative Donato, who came through a few years ago and all the seats were done over, the acoustics, I believe, the organ was repaired, or is in the process of being repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1762.791s">It's</a> a lot of good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1764.412s">But</a> the night of that mayoral debate, not only the dignity and the respect that was shown for the two candidates to one another on that stage, but the enthusiasm and the Medford pride that <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1777.022s">was</a> exhumed through that whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1780.864s">The</a> restaurants and everything else, it was something that I was actually very, very proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1785.246s">I</a> went in there thinking we were just gonna see a debate and go home, but I saw a lot more. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1789.087s">I</a> saw a lot of Medford people that are excited that there's an election, are excited to participate, watching that debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1795.61s">And</a> last but not least, the first I'm hearing about it this evening is about the debate not being played. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1802.843s">They</a> made it loud and clear that that was going to be on the public access channel, I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1807.928s">So</a> if we can get an update from the mayor, because certainly I think it's very important that the debates be played just as the Tufts University events are being broadcast on the local access channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1821.459s">So</a> if we could get an update from the mayor's office on that particular piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1825.403s">And</a> also, if we could send out a thank you to the Somerville Community Access TV for coming in that evening and providing quality camera work and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1836.348s">I</a> know the sound from what I heard was a little bit off at the beginning, but they tweaked it throughout the debate, and it was just a great production. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1845.312s">So</a> I want to commend my colleague, Councilor Penta, for participating that evening, as well as our former colleague, Stephanie Burke, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1854.238s">participating,</a> because it takes two candidates to have a debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1857.239s">And</a> both of them stepped up, did something that's not that easy, and brought a lot of Medford pride to the Medford community last week.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1901.309s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1906.01s">Who</a> is saying that this event's not being played? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1908.131s">I</a> mean, they've been publicizing it that it's going to be getting replayed and replayed the beginning and Mr. Veneziano, the whole group, that was the intent from Jump Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1916.056s">Otherwise</a> they wouldn't have brought in scat and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1918.658s">Does</a> anyone know who's saying this from the city or do you have an answer Rob? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1924.662s">Do</a> you know where this is being said?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1931.68s">Well,</a> we can't govern on rulings.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3197.502s">Just</a> waiting to take the vote, that's all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3839.188s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3841.509s">And,</a> uh, appreciate you being here again, Mr. Zamparelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3844.591s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3845.307s">I</a> don't have any specific questions at this point, but you guys are being very, very proactive, being here a couple times, holding the other community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3855.592s">I'm</a> very impressed, to be honest with you, because sometimes we get the calls after the fact to clean up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3863.216s">And</a> you guys are being very proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3865.777s">And</a> based upon that, I know that if I do get any questions, I'll be calling you at your office for specific residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3871.36s">But</a> thank you for being upfront, open, and <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3875.567s">Very</a> accessible so far.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6475.112s">If</a> I may, can we also send to the superintendent of Y is in the DPW commissioner on behalf of the resident to check the manhole covers currently at between Walcott and Woburn on high street, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6486.979s">If</a> they can do something to tidy them up so that, especially now that the snow plowing and stuff is going to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6491.142s">I</a> hate to even think about it, but within a few months, so.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7562.067s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7563.607s">Just</a> for the record, because we're talking about an individual, there was no allegations of beating anyone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7568.329s">No,</a> no, but I'm just saying.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_VQ37Ro1sDkM/2025-03-21_VQ37Ro1sDkM.html">Medford City Council - October 13, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=37.266s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=38.907s">I'd</a> like to suspend rule number 33 to take papers 15-693 and 15-694 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=41.528s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Camuso, suspension of the rules to take
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=85.777s">Can</a> we explain what we're voting on? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=87.158s">I</a> didn't hear the council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=834.334s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=836.135s">Um,</a> if it's okay with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=837.936s">Fritz,</a> um, she knows that this city council has been very active, particularly in the South Medford area to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=846.421s">Uh,</a> I would suggest we send this to the transportation subcommittee because nine out of 10 of the issues that she's presented our, um, transportation issues, number one, and number two, uh, like the, the spots next to Oasis, we have to get a ruling from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=860.41s">If</a> it's private property, if we can restrict them from parking there, <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=864.203s">and</a> all of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=865.744s">So</a> I would say I'd like to make a motion to send this to the Transportation Subcommittee if we could meet within a week or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=871.667s">What</a> is that feedback?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=994.198s">That's</a> one of the busiest businesses in South Medford right now, though, by Medford residents.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1002.444s">But</a> if you talk to the gentleman that runs that business and some of the other businesses, they say maybe the condos were too much for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1009.289s">So</a> you hear both. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1011.41s">I</a> mean, I understand your concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1015.805s">But</a> that whole block has predominantly been a C2 and a C1 district, commercial.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1023.971s">My</a> thing is, if Oasis didn't go in there, it may be another bakery or another business. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1028.514s">It's</a> not going to be a rental unit for housing or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1032.497s">That's</a> zoned, commercial zoned.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1646.9s">Do</a> you actually have the minutes with you, Ian, that we can take a look at of the votes <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1650.513s">Because</a> I know one thing that you stated regarding refurbished secondhand signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1656.338s">I</a> don't believe that is 100% accurate, because Steve Tanaglia does the signage.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1670.009s">They</a> reuse signs and re-letter them, but we don't purchase them secondhand.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2535.236s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2537.657s">There's</a> two motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2539.518s">I</a> think we've heard the complaints at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2541.799s">We</a> want to get action. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2543.359s">There's</a> two different ways that people think would be the best possible way to go about doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2548.602s">One</a> is through the subcommittee process where you can actually have the DPW commissioner in front of us and the city solicitor that can tell us if the bollards are legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2557.238s">The</a> building commissioner can be there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2560.26s">Because</a> right now, I don't know if the spots next to the jewelers and next to Oasis are legal spots or illegal spots based upon zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2568.945s">And</a> these are the questions that I'd like to know, because the traffic commission may have taken a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2573.927s">And</a> I do see that, and I appreciate the minutes of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2576.989s">And</a> they have taken an affirmative vote to put the ballads up. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2579.891s">But</a> are we going to get people that are property owners to come after the city now? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2586.452s">because</a> it's taken up a pocket spot that goes along with the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2588.833s">These</a> are the things I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2590.233s">So</a> my recommendation is to still send it to the transportation subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2594.474s">And,</a> um, and, and I know there's another recommendation on the floor, but at this point I suggest we take a vote and whatever way it goes.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2746.956s">Does</a> the chair have a motion?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2798.618s">And</a> over the past, I've been working with you over the past five or six years, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2803.359s">I've</a> only lived in Medford five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2804.759s">So</a> five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2806.06s">And</a> oftentimes I say, have you called the police?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2809.742s">And</a> when the police are notified of a specific situation, they do send someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2813.604s">It</a> may not be instantaneously based upon other stuff going on in the city, but they eventually do.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2840.059s">I</a> can tell you right now it's not that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2842.181s">They</a> may be tied up with other stuff, they eventually do come.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2848.485s">If</a> you have a truck parked on the sidewalk, <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2851.581s">and</a> they don't come, then I expect you to call one of the members of this council, any of the seven sitting here, or the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2857.183s">She</a> has. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2857.583s">And</a> I can assure you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2858.303s">I</a> have. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2858.883s">Well,</a> I can assure you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2859.824s">I</a> call him. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2860.884s">If</a> he didn't get a hold of someone to get down there, shame on him.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2866.446s">Yeah,</a> the police department has someone go down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2868.626s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2869.507s">They</a> haven't when you called? <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2870.407s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2873.908s">This</a> is an enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2874.908s">If</a> this was going on on my sidewalk, I'd call the police, or anybody else in this city would call the police, and they would be down.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2887.188s">And</a> that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2887.908s">We're</a> acknowledging that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3305.16s">There's</a> also a request to move a bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3309.061s">Councilor</a> Penta chairs the subcommittee on transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3312.202s">There's</a> several items in there that the meeting hasn't been called. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3314.782s">So</a> this is, a lot more has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3318.874s">The</a> bus stop moving has to be done at that level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3322.515s">That's</a> our, we said it a few weeks ago about moving the bus stops in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3326.576s">That</a> falls under the city council's domain. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3329.357s">So</a> if nothing else, we should have the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3330.997s">Vote</a> on it right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3334.938s">You</a> don't have to send in some mystery committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3336.318s">Sir,</a> don't interrupt the council, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3337.899s">So</a> as I said, the chairperson should call a meeting to discuss some of these other issues that are present in itself.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3546.23s">The</a> role is called. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3547.811s">I</a> would ask respectfully that chairperson Penta holds a subcommittee meeting to discuss the bus stop <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3553.699s">and</a> the rest of the papers that have been lingering in that transportation subcommittee for some time, uh, fought with so that we can take up the stuff that actually has the domain here at the city council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3623.256s">That</a> the chairman holds a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3624.717s">He's</a> stuck lingering in there for a long time.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4112.604s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4113.105s">If</a> you refer to our budget on page 13, we funded the negotiated salaries account, which was line item 5110, for $265,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4122.366s">That's</a> a number that we all should know.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4701.243s">Yes,</a> I'd just like to thank Mr. Veneziano, as well as the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4705.065s">And</a> also, if we could send a acknowledgment and a congratulations to Margaret Weigel, who was just appointed by the mayor to a three-year term on the Chevalier Auditorium Commission.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4718.253s">If</a> we could make that as a motion, please.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5129.301s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5130.502s">I</a> just want to announce <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5133.165s">This</a> Sunday, October 18th, 2015 at 2 p.m., there's going to be the groundbreaking in the coalition AFTA that's going to feature entertainment, and it's going to be a somber day in memory of Crystal Campbell, but it's also going to be a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5151.911s">It's</a> the beginning of keeping her memory alive forever in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5155.752s">The</a> mayor has worked very, very hard to get us to the point we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5160.759s">in</a> collaboration with the Medford City Council, where there were several votes last year that were before us to move the project forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5168.281s">And</a> it's just going to be a real nice day to keep Crystal Campbell, Lingzi Liu, Officer Collier, and Martin Richard, to keep their memories alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5177.542s">So</a> I want to just announce it's Sunday at 2 PM, right here at the corner of Riverside Ave and Ring Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5184.064s">And</a> everyone is invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5187.204s">I</a> hear the Givino sisters are going to sing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5189.465s">Yes,</a> they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5190.635s">And</a> they were beautiful the other day at Mr. Scarpelli's funeral up at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5195.557s">Francis</a> Church. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5196.897s">And</a> the Giovino sisters, they always nail it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5200.359s">Voce</a> Angelorum.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_sEpbONopS5E/2025-03-21_sEpbONopS5E.html">Medford City Council - October 6, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=415.891s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=416.832s">And</a> I certainly think that this is a positive move, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=423.678s">And</a> my only concern when it comes to this, I do plan on voting for it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=429.523s">But</a> my one question is, you said outside people are still allowed to use their fishing and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=436.249s">Parkland,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=437.03s">Parkland,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=439.232s">Is</a> there a dollar amount that we're not going to be getting at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=442.741s">Has</a> that been looked at as far as fees and stuff in the past?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=463.475s">Well,</a> the reason I ask, I want to make sure that because of this move this evening, next year people aren't going to be looking at a substantial increase in the fees because we are limiting certain resources to Medford residents only. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=476.406s">So</a> I think that's a fair question and it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=482.131s">But</a> I do plan on supporting this this evening.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=833.24s">If</a> we could also just send a little note of thanks to Representative Donato for offering the services of the House Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=840.845s">I</a> would say that this has a favorable shot of getting passed when it hits there where they were an integral part of drafting the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=847.05s">Yes,</a> they were quite helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=849.091s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4504.997s">If</a> the vote's going to take place this Friday, why don't we table it for one week and take it up next week?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5369.96s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and thank you for your monumental efforts to get this on the ballot, because definitely there is pros and cons of this as we speak to different people throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5381.384s">So</a> there's no better way than to get an actual gauge than to have people actually participate and take that vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5390.327s">Coincidentally,</a> Governor Baker this morning was in the Great Hall up at the Statehouse, and he was <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5398.282s">having</a> a little gathering to celebrate the 15th year anniversary of the signing of the original bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5404.306s">I</a> believe it was on the Governor Salucci back in 02? <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5408.448s">Swift.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5408.808s">All</a> right, Governor Swift. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5409.649s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5410.189s">Yeah,</a> 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5411.99s">Governor</a> Swift. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5412.771s">So</a> that took place earlier today up at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5416.553s">But</a> with that being said, I actually look forward to the results of this portion of the ballot question that's going to take place in November, because it's certainly going to tell <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5428.857s">the</a> elected officials moving forward, where the interests are, I think, throughout the community as a whole, if people are behind the Brooks Estate, say, that we just discussed, or behind other areas like the Royal House that would be eligible for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5446.472s">So</a> it may give a better picture moving forward on moving certain projects forward and maybe not so much as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5455.24s">So</a> I think that the <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5457.115s">The</a> results will be indicative on where people want this community to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5462.238s">So</a> I'm looking forward to that as a bigger piece of the whole picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5465.7s">But</a> like I said, I just want to thank you for your commitment to get the signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5470.663s">I</a> know often over the last 16 years as an elected official here in our community, we often heard people say, we're going to get the signatures and we're going to put this on the ballot and this and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5480.203s">And</a> it really never comes to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5482.625s">But</a> you and other members of the public out here.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5490.552s">I</a> must have seen Mimi more over the past two months than I've seen her in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5496.316s">I</a> think since Tom Birmingham's election, way back when, when she was a big shot at the SEIU. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5502.181s">But</a> with that being said, I just want to thank you all for your effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5506.084s">And</a> I look forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5508.206s">working</a> with you, whatever way this goes, at least for a month or so, because I'll be retiring at the end of December. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5515.59s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5517.191s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9040.197s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9042.538s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9044.179s">I</a> think that this is similar to the question that was before this honorable body several years ago, and it was in-law apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9051.706s">And</a> at the time it presented itself, there were residents in the community that wanted to be able to have in-law apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9058.61s">There</a> was a lot of pushback from the building department at the time and different boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9064.965s">I</a> think we have to find a direction where the body wants to go before we do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9070.489s">So</a> I would suggest, like Councilor Marks, I think Councilor Knight may have said it, send this to the appropriate subcommittee and hash out, because I'd hate to say any work get done on it if there really isn't some direction as a result of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9085.82s">And</a> Councilor Knight is looking to start the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9088.843s">I</a> think there's merits both to and <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9091.618s">for</a> and against on the conversions itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9096.002s">Currently,</a> right now, I don't know what the restrictions are. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9098.824s">I</a> don't know if you have to have separate boilers, separate meters, common areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9102.928s">These</a> are all good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9104.289s">Quite</a> simply, this could be done just through the zoning, some of the zoning issues, I'm sorry, zoning restrictions as well, through the permitting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9113.416s">So</a> we may not even have to do a total ordinance on it, but we could say, okay, you have to have a separate and distinct boiler. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9118.601s">Another</a> restriction is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9121.11s">Minimum</a> amount of square footage per unit is X. Minimum amount of bedrooms is X. There's a lot of different variables. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9128.373s">So</a> I would suggest, like Councilor Markshead and Councilor Knight, I believe, sending this to the housing subcommittee and discuss where at least we want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9136.656s">Because</a> quite honestly, I don't know enough about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9140.458s">I</a> know that there's sometimes parking problems and stuff that may arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9144.599s">But</a> if you have a two-family house now and you're renting it to a couple with a baby, <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9149.783s">It's</a> no different than if that couple is paying a mortgage payment each month. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9153.54s">for</a> that same unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9154.361s">They're</a> going to have the same number of vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9157.964s">So</a> I'm looking at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9159.745s">I</a> really don't see the advantages and the disadvantages. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9163.448s">Quite</a> honestly, someone would maybe rather buy it so they can write off their interest on their mortgage payment per month rather than paying rent, which you can't write off. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9174.937s">And</a> there's just so many different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9177.059s">I</a> just think the appropriate place to vet this out and see where we're going is the <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9182.49s">is</a> the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9183.61s">In</a> Councilor Penta's question, that's a valid question. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9186.631s">That</a> could be answered that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9188.392s">City</a> solicitor might say, as you indicated, no, this can't be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9193.113s">And</a> then we can look at maybe restrictions, the separate boiler, the this, the that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9198.495s">So</a> I know there is some state laws I'm not 100% sure on, but water meters, I believe you have to have separate <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9205.511s">electric</a> meter maybe, but I'd be only fooling all of us if I pretended to know what I'm talking about on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9213.873s">So</a> I just think we should vet this out at the appropriate subcommittee.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9290.618s">Well,</a> point of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9291.979s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9293.9s">With</a> all due respect, if the young lady wants to discuss a topic, and that's her discretion, it's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9302.128s">To</a> say that councillors should not discuss the topic that's brought up, I can't support that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9308.094s">And</a> this is a city council meeting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9313.219s">It's</a> a valid point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9316.202s">And</a> with all due respect, this is an open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9318.424s">So</a> anyone that wants to run for office can come right through that door, just as you did last election.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9324.95s">No,</a> you can come down and discuss these issues.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=640.801s">Just</a> to clarify for Councilor Penta, they came before us on April 28th, and we tabled the matter pending <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=646.937s">the</a> Board of Appeals as well as Mass State Lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=649.598s">It's</a> actually unfinished business still.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2906.112s">I'll</a> yield to the gentleman.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3450.416s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3451.417s">And</a> I already said a little bit earlier regarding my support, but I'd just like to back up my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3458.653s">I'm</a> looking at this as somewhat of an economic development of the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3463.536s">Just</a> last week, there was some discussion regarding a sign and certain members of the council wanted to shut a sign off at the new Marriott that's coming to our community at certain times. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3472.562s">That</a> was thrown out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3474.023s">And</a> at that point, I was a little concerned because I think we have to be, show that we're with the times, so to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3483.068s">I</a> look back, I have another paper on later on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3486.125s">to</a> discuss another piece of economic development in our community that was not supported by the Medford City Council, other than myself and I believe Councilor Knight at the time, and that was the bank across from the Medford Fire Station for a drive-thru. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3500.551s">And</a> there was an arrangement, an agreement with all the neighbors in the area on Thomas <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3504.798s">And</a> that did not have the votes, and now we're sitting here with an empty building for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3509.281s">So,</a> I do have concerns of moving the city forward in the economic development piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3515.245s">But,</a> you know, as we look around the community, we have some great restaurants now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3518.627s">We</a> have Carroll's, who's not so much in a residential neighbourhood, but we have Razzo's and Bocelli's that are right in the heart of neighbourhoods very similar to Lambert Street area and Spring Street Extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3531.436s">For</a> some time, my wife and I owned a corner <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3533.854s">Irving</a> Street in West Medford, which directly abuts West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3538.895s">And</a> although we didn't have the late hours, we also knew when we moved in there, there was a potential for the Bistro 5 to petition for later hours and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3549.898s">And,</a> you know, I just look at this as an economic development piece for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3555.119s">You</a> know, last week, too, there was some talk about parking, and certain people are for and against the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3560.061s">and</a> I got the numbers from last week, the meals tax has actually been up by a good amount when I compared January 1st of 2014 to 8-31-2014, and then I ran the numbers for the same time period of 2015, throw in the worst winter we've had in probably the last 35 years in the city of Medford, and to have the meals tax up during that same period of time, <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3587.859s">and</a> say that the businesses are suffering and lacking and are really getting hit because of the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3595.742s">It</a> just didn't make sense and I wanted to take it to the next level and actually get data to back that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3600.764s">And</a> when I did that I was quite surprised because if you look back at the winter that we had, it was one of the worst winters in the history of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3616.93s">As</a> far as this particular establishment, like I said, I can go along with the review, but I think we have to give them an opportunity to operate with the later hours if something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3630.199s">I</a> understand the gentleman that came up and talked about crime and the drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3633.401s">I'm</a> not sure where he went, but that's all over this community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3637.443s">We</a> just hired the other day, the city of Medford hired the first time outreach coordinator to deal with the opiate problem that we're dealing with here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3645.31s">She</a> was just hired within the last two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3647.431s">And</a> so I think the city is doing our best to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3652.733s">I</a> think part of the problem you have in some of these areas at night is because at a certain time it's shut down and it tends to attract people that may want to do not so good things, whether it's in a parking lot in a vehicle or somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3667.678s">And</a> this will actually act as a deterrent from things of that nature with having a little bit more viability <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3675.26s">going</a> on at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3675.961s">I</a> certainly understand the concerns of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3679.043s">I</a> certainly understand it, but I firmly believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3682.005s">And</a> you look at Mr. Karofalos, a gentleman that came here, it's the American dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3686.689s">He's</a> worked hard his whole life, his whole life, and he owns that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3690.912s">He</a> owns that building, he's a Medford resident, and he understands, he would be the last person that wants the neighbors that he's been next to <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3699.228s">for</a> all these years to have these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3703.55s">But</a> I just feel confident through the proper restrictions, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3710.873s">And</a> as far as the other things that the other gentleman mentioned, these are serious police matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3715.975s">And</a> if you see people drinking in the parking lot in vehicles, it's a serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3721.537s">But</a> it's not something that's going to get any better or worse because of the permit that's before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3728.507s">So</a> for those reasons, I just think that we should give them a shake and an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3735.094s">And</a> quite honestly, as I said last week, I just think Medford's getting the, and it's partly because of City Hall and this city council on occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3745.93s">People</a> don't want to come to Medford as much as they want to go to other communities that are willing to listen, and to open the door, open the avenue, and be for new things, or move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3757.192s">You</a> know, we're at a very, very critical juncture in this community over the next 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3761.933s">We</a> have Mr. Wynn, who's breaking ground on a casino right over the line in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3769.454s">And</a> the entrance and exit to that casino is going to be on the Charlestown side. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3774.702s">So</a> there was a lot of misinformation at first that it was going to be at the circle over on this side. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3779.905s">And</a> that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3781.726s">The</a> case is it's going to be on the Charlestown side with a ramp coming from the highways and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3787.028s">If</a> indeed the building permits are issued, which it appears it is, the last hurdle was taken up by Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3794.472s">But</a> as I talk about the critical juncture, you know, I want to see people that have capital that want to <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3801.533s">bring</a> something vibrant to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3803.613s">I</a> want to see them come here, because they know they have a city hall that wants to move Medford forward, whether it be in the corner office, whether it be department heads under the mayor's lead, whether it be the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3814.976s">I</a> think we want to send the message that we want people to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3817.756s">We</a> have many lots on Mystic Ave that are going up for sale every few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3822.577s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3824.097s">I</a> want to see more Marriotts come to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3828.191s">As</a> I said last week, when we start talking about the Marriott shutting their sign off at a certain time because the roast beef place next door has to do it, it's night and day as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3839.024s">It's</a> night and day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3840.105s">So</a> if we could send that vision, and I think this a lot starts in the economic development office, but as I said, we're at a very critical juncture. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3849.143s">I</a> think we're going to have opportunity because of that casino that we have never had in the last 50 years in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3856.348s">We're</a> going to have people that want to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3858.109s">We're</a> going to have people that go on the internet and see a room at the casino for $500 a night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3863.713s">OK,</a> let me stay at the Marriott or the Sheraton on Mr. Gavin Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3867.395s">And</a> I'd rather see them here in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3869.944s">than</a> over in Chelsea or in Somerville or other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3873.027s">You</a> know, we've got to have vision like Mayor Curtatone, a vision of Assembly Row. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3877.331s">You</a> know, you go down there, whoever thought that legal seafood would be opened up on the Mystic River a quarter of a mile from the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3884.999s">Never</a> in a million years I thought that was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3887.762s">But</a> I certainly hear the neighbors loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3891.185s">If</a> you have specific police <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3893.42s">Police</a> issues, if you could please either talk to one of the councillors after the meeting, or we'll get you in touch with the chief of police, because those issues aren't going away, whether you have them or every business in the community closed at 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3907.726s">Those</a> issues are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3912.828s">No,</a> no, and I understand that, but we have to take the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3916.349s">We</a> can't make the permit become <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3920.198s">The</a> permit's separate and distinct from the issues you're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3923.281s">And</a> I just think that we have to police that area a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3928.285s">And</a> I just think that we should give them a shake. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3930.267s">I</a> know the councilor mentioned, what did you mention for a review, 60? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3932.829s">60</a> days. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3934.27s">A</a> 60-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3935.351s">And</a> at that point, we can look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3936.893s">And</a> if it's creating a major havoc, believe me, the chief of police will be the first one that will be down here petitioning the council to get rid of the license if it's going to create a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3946.9s">On</a> my end, I'll just finish with saying this has come up before with RAZOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3951.122s">I</a> remember the liquor hearing for RAZOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3953.663s">I</a> remember other hearings for businesses of similar nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3956.784s">And</a> there hasn't been one of them that have been back before us to have the license pulled or anything as a result of the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3964.768s">So</a> with that being said, I just wanted to give a little bit more background on why I continue to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3972.751s">And</a> I would hope the council has the vision to at least give them the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3976.678s">with</a> the full expectation that they stay to the high standards as their father and mother have done over the past 25, 30 years, as Mrs. DePaola indicated.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5242.83s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5245.831s">I</a> just wanted to let the gentleman know the chief of police and all the other department heads have signed off, and that's where they normally say they would concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5253.474s">Signed</a> off on what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5254.674s">I'm</a> going to give you the whole packet in two seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5256.815s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5256.955s">You</a> can take a look at it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5705.894s">Can</a> we just let the gentleman speak first? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5708.496s">He's</a> been waiting patiently at the microphone.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5950.884s">On</a> the motion for tabling, at this point, I'm just going to take a little different stance, because I think we're charged with the responsibility to either vote this yea or nay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5960.547s">Obviously,</a> it's a very, very nice neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5963.167s">Lambert</a> Street has hundreds of people living on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5966.148s">We</a> have several residents here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5968.568s">But</a> I think in the best interest of <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5971.742s">the</a> whole city in that particular area, I'm ready to take a vote on it and with the reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5977.624s">So</a> as far as tabling it, I just don't see anything coming out of it this evening, to be honest, because I don't think anything's going to be said that's going to say people, OK, do you have a few points? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5987.528s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5988.008s">But</a> I'm going to vote no on the tabling. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5990.369s">I'm</a> going to vote no on the tabling for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5992.83s">I</a> think we're charged to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5996.757s">move</a> it forward, because there are a lot of people that live in that immediate area that aren't here for them or against them, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6002.32s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6003.36s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6196.899s">These</a> are not the property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6198.059s">These</a> are the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6199.059s">The</a> property owners are in there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6201.06s">Oh,</a> you just said property, so I just wanted to make sure we're getting apples to apples.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7305.549s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7306.629s">And</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7307.909s">I</a> think this is a great, great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7311.03s">And</a> I want to applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7314.791s">City</a> of Medford, 1-1-2015 to 8-31-2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7316.331s">Meals</a> tax, $349,605.74 in meals tax for people participating in eating in our establishments in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7332.912s">If</a> they get an abatement for a new business, in that case, a restaurant to come in, you give them something, an incentive to start up costs, basically, like other communities do, this goes hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7348.042s">Like</a> you said, urban renewal, development, it's what cities and towns are doing to get creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7355.947s">Look</a> at Somerville, many, many, many years ago, 1980s. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7357.748s">1980s.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7361.957s">It</a> was all these little establishments, and people got incentives to clean up and make it vibrant. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7370.36s">Now</a> you look at it, and it's a mecca of walking to all the different squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7376.801s">It's</a> just, at the end of the day, Mr. President, if we give an incentive, just in this particular instance, say if it's a restaurant, you're going to make it up in the meals tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7388.033s">So</a> I understand what John's trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7391.334s">But</a> at the end of the day, this is what's going to bring quality business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7393.955s">It's</a> going to put people to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7395.836s">It's</a> going to continue to grow the tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7398.357s">And</a> it's going to get a storefront that is currently maybe vacant, something in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7403.218s">And</a> that's the intent of it, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7404.779s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7405.759s">And</a> I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7407.039s">I</a> think that this is a heaven vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7409.0s">I'm</a> thinking outside the box, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7410.861s">So</a> I do support Councilor Knight on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7718.174s">And</a> I'm glad Councilor Marks brought up Huff's Bakery. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7721.609s">Because</a> interesting enough, Hoffs Bakery was before this Medford City Council for the TIF, which was a tax incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7729.692s">And</a> it was not unanimous vote of this city council to give them, some people had the vision to see that they were gonna put, like Councilor Mock said, X amount of people to work, gonna clean up a development behind 9th Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7742.656s">That</a> was a program that became before the city council, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7746.465s">It's</a> just another fact that this city council, and we're all entitled to our votes, there's no question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7753.728s">But</a> check the record on it, it was not a unanimous vote of this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7757.049s">And</a> now, unfortunately, because Malden is offering them a tax incentive similar to what Councilor Knight is looking to do here, they are moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7765.913s">But</a> the TIF on the Hoffs Bakery was before this city council a few years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7770.774s">But</a> thank you for bringing that up, Councilor Marksley.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8103.363s">I</a> just want to wish Robert Emmons Carey Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8106.624s">Good</a> luck in his retirement and give him more time to be around the schools and helping out our children.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8513.484s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8515.125s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8517.147s">Tony</a> Bova, just don't even know where to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8519.548s">I</a> echo the sentiments of Councilor Penter and Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8525.252s">Just</a> a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8526.973s">And</a> it's kind of ironic, too, because we saw him at the community day a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8531.056s">He</a> had the table for Medford Youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8533.557s">And</a> when I was shooting the breeze with him, I says, hey, you look the exact same as you did as when I was a mite. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8540.12s">He</a> hasn't changed a wink. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8541.081s">He's</a> one of those guys that just looks the exact same. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8545.146s">Lost</a> a little hair, right, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8546.768s">But</a> Tony's just a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8548.75s">You</a> know, I played for him when I was a mite. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8551.313s">And</a> I went right through, played at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8553.796s">And</a> he was always a big part of the high school team and high school athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8557.801s">And</a> it didn't stop with hockey, as the Councilor noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8560.866s">started</a> the figure skating. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8561.947s">It</a> was under his leadership that girls hockey was started at the youth level, and then Councilor Lungo took over and got it initiated at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8571.574s">But</a> just a great guy, and I do support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8574.276s">And</a> also to piggyback on what Councilor Penta said, there are other people that this council has looked to honor over some time, and maybe now the mayor can take some of those under advisement, and if he sees <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8589.314s">true</a> that they're deserving, as this council has, to move forward with some of them.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9224.463s">point</a> of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9226.344s">I</a> know this year the big race is the mayor's race. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9229.586s">So</a> chairman Donato will be notified to come down on behalf of the democratic candidate, which is, well, I don't want to get into politics, but there's a democrat and a republican running. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9240.532s">So</a> the republican individual who's here this evening, Mr. Capucci, will come down on behalf of the republican candidate for mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9247.236s">Is</a> that how this works?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9285.696s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9384.341s">The</a> next part of the questions was? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9387.103s">It</a> should be all candidates.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9389.584s">It</a> should be all 16, all 15, whatever it is.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9953.729s">I</a> understand that we're asking questions here, but we haven't had these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9962.567s">There's</a> never been a question of ethical standards during an election that I've heard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9967.95s">I</a> just, I don't know, I'm getting a bad taste, almost like it's conspiracy theory here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9975.255s">I</a> understand that we have to obviously make sure that the ethical standards are upheld. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9983.678s">I</a> don't know of any particular situation that's leading up to these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9988.343s">If</a> so, this should be brought not only to our clerk, but to the Secretary of State's office, who oversees the elections in Massachusetts.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10017.877s">Councilor</a> Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10020.819s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10021.859s">Councilor</a> Penta just said that all the Councilors should be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10024.701s">I</a> think you have to take it one step further, because that would be someone that's not a current Councilor may look at that and say, well, why can the Councilors be notified? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10030.805s">I</a> would like to make a blanket. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10032.386s">Everybody's</a> notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10033.286s">Anyone</a> that's going to appear on the ballot, <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10035.767s">But</a> no, you just said that the council is getting notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10037.688s">And</a> I think you just didn't add to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10041.009s">But</a> with that being said, I think that everybody that's appearing on the ballot in November, and I'm not one of them this year, with that being said, I think everyone should be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10053.072s">That's</a> all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10097.063s">We're</a> going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10099.404s">So</a> as people are coming back in, I think an arrangement was made for a 90 day at midnight and then the 91st day it would be the one o'clock if there's no problems.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10392.666s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10393.106s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10394.847s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10396.288s">And</a> first off, I want to commend Councilor Marks because I really didn't see Kula Hedge prevailing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10402.132s">So,</a> nice job, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10405.374s">So,</a> a motion for approval for the first 90 days <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10411.53s">open</a> till midnight, the 91st day to the 365th day, 1 a.m., with a restriction of 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10420.656s">karaoke</a> stops, and that we ask the city to upgrade the lights in the parking lot, and when I say the city, that's the mayor, because he has the purse strings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10430.783s">That's</a> gonna be a separate issue.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10433.245s">We'll</a> do that as a separate paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10434.326s">Do</a> it as a separate paper, so motion for approval with the conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10439.205s">In</a> the probation, the one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10441.026s">One</a> year review. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10441.727s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10443.388s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10444.089s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10445.149s">One</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10447.031s">With</a> the butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10448.172s">Actual</a> butters, not computerized butters.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10475.881s">That</a> won't be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10477.121s">You</a> don't want to let people in that late, because they were there for obvious reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10480.083s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10481.644s">All</a> the bars are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10483.273s">The</a> bars in Malden and everywhere else, they shut the doors at a time before that, so they're not just getting the refresh.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10500.013s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10500.713s">If</a> there's bouncers, the year review. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10503.477s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10504.748s">If</a> there's bounces, there may be a review before that year is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10507.95s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10563.868s">And</a> next year, they'll cater the fishermen's feast fire in the North End.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10731.727s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10733.248s">On</a> this particular matter, if we could send the road renovations to the DPW Fort Worth? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10738.493s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10738.653s">Because</a> over the next 30 to 45 days, there is major renovations going on in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10743.157s">And</a> just on that as well, ask that people be patient, because they're grinding down a significant amount of roads that they didn't plan on doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10751.043s">So</a> if we could ask for people's patience, because there's going to be a lot of roadwork going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10755.247s">On</a> that motion, all those in favor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11401.273s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11402.274s">If</a> we could send a request to the Building Commissioner to find out the status of the permits, <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11409.782s">and</a> everything else that goes along with that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11412.843s">It's</a> the building right next to Tedeschi's. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11416.865s">And</a> what's the wedding place by the dresses? <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11421.267s">Teresa's</a> boutique, exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11423.989s">It's</a> been sitting vacant for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11425.629s">There</a> really hasn't been that much activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11427.71s">So</a> if we can get an update, and if they don't have an update, if they can reach out to the developer and find out what's going on with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11434.979s">Very</a> good.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Q7cD9OP2TNA/2025-03-21_Q7cD9OP2TNA.html">Medford City Council - September 22, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=416.641s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=418.321s">And</a> I'd like to commend Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=423.302s">I</a> do believe it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=425.403s">When</a> this program first went into inception, a gentleman by the name of Don Ouellette at the time said that we would have similar software to detect leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=434.984s">And</a> also that unnamed city engineer from a surrounding community who brings a wealth of knowledge to our community as a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=443.286s">I</a> want to commend her and thank her as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=446.262s">With</a> that being said, I support this wholeheartedly, and I think this is something that can't wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=451.546s">Because</a> just over the past few weeks, I know two people, one in particular with a water bill that went up about $1,000 in the water bill because of a leak in the lawn sprinkler irrigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=464.677s">It</a> just kept going, going, and going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=466.198s">So</a> I do support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=468.34s">And</a> once again, I'd like to thank Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1557.026s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1558.307s">Yes,</a> I was able to track that back through my emails, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1562.409s">It</a> was a violation that was issued MDC 5482. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1565.09s">It</a> was issued on 8-15-2015 at 5-16 in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1571.233s">So</a> that was turned around within a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1573.674s">So</a> there may be something going on with the specific ones in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1578.016s">But</a> the notice that someone sent to me saying that the adjudication and stuff took place, that is the date that the violation was issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1586.182s">on</a> the ticket in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1589.283s">So</a> I'm starting to think maybe that's one person that's not doing their job possibly, but we have to investigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1597.186s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1597.906s">We</a> need that report and we certainly need that committee meeting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2086.773s">I</a> just wanted to let the residents know the city of Arlington put out a press release last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2093.356s">They're</a> going parking kiosks and meters, the entire <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2097.032s">City,</a> Massachusetts Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2098.873s">Right</a> now they're in the parking lots and they're actually putting them out on Massachusetts Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2101.995s">They're</a> rolling it out according to the city manager in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2106.559s">So,</a> just as a point of information.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2314.794s">One</a> week, we want to get out of the contract because it's broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2318.176s">This</a> week, there's maybe recommendations to do stuff that was well within our right, like giving senior citizens passes where they're exempted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2328.862s">Let's</a> make up our mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2330.423s">Are</a> we either going to follow the contract or do within our right of the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2334.826s">I</a> wholeheartedly support giving senior citizens free parking privileges in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2339.969s">These</a> people no longer have children in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2342.723s">These</a> children, the senior citizens of our community, have made Medford great the way it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2349.027s">So</a> to sit here and go against something that's positive and say that the company, the company, the company, I just feel that I think we have to do what's right by the residents and the city of Medford, not the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2361.814s">I'm</a> not worried about the company.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2518.918s">Also,</a> it's my understanding in talking to the mayor, meters are going to be starting to pop up, the regular old-fashioned meters that Medford Square had back in the 80s within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2532.71s">So</a> there's going to be the regular standalone meters that Chris alluded to, where you just throw the quarter in, and those are going to be starting to get sprinkled around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2544.339s">The</a> elephant in the room here is twofold as far as I'm concerned with the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2548.564s">to</a> just get out of this pocket, and it's going to cost us, as of today, $1.1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2551.665s">$1.1</a> million to get out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2553.086s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2580.465s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, um, the evening that the business owners were at our meeting, when this council voted seven to nothing to send out the, um, to negotiate with Republic parking, it was a seven to nothing vote of the Medford city council that evening and included in that was kiosks and meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2599.715s">clearly</a> in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2600.595s">There</a> was businesses throughout the community that came up that evening and made mention that they would like to have regular meters in front of their stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2607.458s">I</a> know several in West Medford, several in Medford Square have approached the city, would be interested in having the quarter meters in front of their business because it's the type of business where you're just running in in one quarter and rather than going to the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2620.763s">So</a> with that being said, like I said a few minutes ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2625.112s">To</a> get out of it and wipe this out totally, it's $1.1 million as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2630.794s">$300,000</a> in estimated receipts.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2698.993s">Unfortunately,</a> I think the council is confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2701.696s">There's</a> $300,000 that was in our fiscal year budget that we're operating right now, estimated receipts from this parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2709.522s">So</a> you take the $800,000 that's amortized for the actual equipment plus the $300,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2715.508s">that</a> is in estimated receipts, minus a quarter of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2719.429s">So</a> rather than 1.1 million, it's probably around 1 million, say, to buy it outright right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2726.39s">To</a> say that the city council did not support it, we supported it on two occasions, seven to nothing vote, seven to nothing vote, loud and clear, it has to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2735.372s">The</a> mayor did have a thing with that, that it came back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2739.833s">We</a> met in this council office over here, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2743.119s">before</a> the mayor signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2744.38s">I</a> don't know the exact date, but we met in that council office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2747.583s">Some</a> of the people that are in the room this evening were at that meeting as well as a lot of other businesses throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2754.309s">The</a> place was jammed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2755.651s">It</a> was packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2756.211s">We</a> were actually going to move the meeting into the council chamber, but we couldn't because there was another meeting going on in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2761.436s">So,</a> uh, it was a seven to nothing vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2763.518s">It's</a> seven to nothing vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2819.234s">Mr.</a> President, Councilor Cusack. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2821.678s">Like</a> I said, the records of the Medford City Council don't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2824.239s">It</a> was a seven to nothing vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2825.759s">People</a> can pretend they didn't vote for it, did vote for it, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2828.3s">I'm</a> not gonna argue any more about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2829.581s">It</a> was seven to zip. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2830.961s">Anyone</a> can go down to the city clerk's office, see the minutes of that particular meeting in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2835.563s">It</a> was seven to nothing vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2837.403s">It</a> only needed five votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2839.804s">I</a> believe it might have needed five or four. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2842.345s">I'm</a> not really sure because it was for up to 10 year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2845.946s">Seven</a> years up front, three years in the rear if the city decides to <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2851.794s">renegotiate</a> up to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2853.955s">So</a> it was a seven to nothing vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2856.076s">And</a> he mentioned the council resolution numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2858.198s">Anyone</a> out there that's watching can go down to the city clerk's office and see the vote of the council was unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2863.721s">So,</a> uh, that's a really, you can't, you can't beat the dead horse anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2868.644s">It</a> was a seven to nothing vote of the Medford city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2871.445s">It</a> was actually one of the few times that we're actually all unanimous behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2876.988s">As</a> we know, we often vote, um, our separate ways and, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2880.192s">That</a> was one that everyone supported.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3034.754s">Point</a> of information as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3038.535s">Based</a> upon the reports that we got from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue as well, as recent as a couple of months ago, the sales and meals tax has jumped dramatically from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3051.177s">So</a> unless the price of meals is double or whatever is going on, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3055.658s">That's</a> actual statistical data from the Department of Revenue.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3328.109s">The</a> Press Jimmy, just so you know, the number I'm basing it off of is the revenue that <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3333.164s">The</a> city of Medford gets back from the Department of Revenue based upon the sales of male's tax.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3340.888s">I</a> can bring, I got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3342.148s">Maybe</a> not your business, I'm talking citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3344.329s">I'll</a> get you the numbers, I'll bring them in your store.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3357.776s">I'll</a> get last year's and this year's.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3360.551s">every</a> month, state, for my business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3362.893s">I</a> can print. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3363.714s">I'm</a> just talking citywide, Jimmy.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3366.195s">There</a> might have been more restaurants that started. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3369.258s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record, sir.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4167.763s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4170.376s">I</a> have to agree with my council colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4172.578s">The</a> traffic is starting to get pretty rough down there, especially during the commuting hours, five o'clock early in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4182.145s">The</a> fact of the matter is this is a state, Department of Transportation is overseeing this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4187.489s">I</a> asked for the MBTA to come forward with a solution within the last three months or so, I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4194.774s">We</a> still have not heard back from them on that particular item. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4199.378s">But</a> it's obvious that something has to be done because people shouldn't be expected to wait for a bus and be breathing in the debris, whether it's jackhammering and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4213.608s">So</a> I think something has to be done, whether it be temporary or a more permanent solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4219.912s">But</a> definitely something has to give on this particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4224.115s">So</a> if we could have them in to discuss this, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4227.31s">Also</a> to discuss some of the express buses that so many Medford residents in this community rely upon to get to work every day into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4237.564s">They're</a> the subject right now of privatization. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4241.093s">with</a> the MBTA, and I'd like to just get a status on where they're going and if the service is going to be as good, because quite honestly, I think the 326 and the 325 bus operated right now does a tremendous, brings tremendous value to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4258.898s">And</a> it's on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4262.86s">It's</a> packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4263.9s">The</a> express buses are packed every single morning going into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4267.748s">So</a> I'd like to hear their plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4269.169s">Maybe</a> I'll put that on at a later meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4272.331s">It's</a> a separate issue because the bridge is more time consuming now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4277.235s">And</a> I do support the councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4278.936s">So</a> I'm going to withdraw that at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4281.618s">And</a> I'm going to bring it forward in a later motion.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4883.937s">As</a> a city, we're striving to bring in quality business and economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4887.739s">To</a> tell a worldwide chain hotel that we can't have their sign lit up all the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4895.134s">There's</a> no way I can support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4896.575s">If</a> I supported that, it would be one of the worst votes I've ever taken as a member of the Medford City Council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4937.915s">Councilor—</a> Point of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4941.856s">Mr.</a> President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4943.437s">I</a> think this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4944.477s">Councilor</a> Camuso, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4946.798s">Councilor</a> Penta stated it's a like business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4949.779s">It's</a> not a like business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4950.879s">One's</a> a 24-hour lodging establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4952.899s">The</a> other one is a roast beef joint. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4955.18s">It's</a> not a like business.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5140.529s">I'm</a> just a little bit... <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5142.359s">disturbed</a> that the comments were made this evening regarding a hotel with the name Marriott on it that's looking to come in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5150.764s">We're</a> trying to entice business into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5154.066s">We</a> have a hotel right out here that faces 400 units of senior housing developments right behind City Hall here that's illuminated 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5165.093s">Quite</a> honestly, when the sign ordinance was written by members of the City Council over the last 30 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5171.504s">It's,</a> I think, getting to the point where it's outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5175.747s">When</a> a place like Meadow Glen Mall had to come before us a few years ago to have a sign that was basically comparable just to keep them in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5184.251s">We</a> got to have a vision moving this city forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5187.553s">And</a> to say that a 24-hour hotel that we want to see come here, I mean, the hotel is going to generate <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5194.672s">taxes</a> every single evening, every time a room is occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5197.894s">The</a> hotel is going to generate economic development as far as people spending their money at Kelly's Roast Beef, at all the stations landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5207.799s">They're</a> going to be using stuff over and Somerville is going to benefit by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5211.941s">Medford</a> Square possibly will benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5213.902s">This</a> is the vision we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5215.283s">We</a> need vision to do Medford Square over and to sit here and to talk about not giving a 24-hour establishment, marry it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5223.807s">I</a> mean, we're lucky that this didn't come up at the beginning of negotiations because a big company like Marriott may not even entertain coming here if they saw that we would even not entertain a sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5235.158s">And</a> the sign is not overly bearing on the neighbourhood at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5239.401s">Quite</a> honestly, there's more lighting coming off over here of the Hyatt right out back of our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5246.846s">In</a> the interest of economic development and trying to move this city forward, I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5251.889s">And</a> to be honest with you, I'm not going to support the six-month review, because I think it's done very tastefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5258.032s">I</a> think it's a win-win for this community.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5403.405s">I</a> just want to wrap up by saying, you know, we're at a very unique juncture here in our community of either moving forward or moving backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5410.411s">We</a> have a big development coming right across the city line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5414.575s">It's</a> going to be known as the Winn-Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5418.238s">We</a> want to let businesses like the Marriott know that Medford wants them to come here and negotiate with us in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5426.078s">and</a> potentially build something on Mystic Ave or wherever they find a parcel of land that may be good for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5434.9s">Because</a> it has to be good for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5436.74s">But</a> I just don't want to send the wrong message out there and have businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5441.381s">Because</a> I've heard over the years, over the last 30 years in this community, people have been... People... I want to choose my words correctly and be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5452.89s">We</a> have heard that people feel uncomfortable sometimes when they come before some bodies here, particularly the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5460.293s">And</a> I just think that in fairness for economic development views and where we're going with our neighboring community, I think we're at a juncture where we just have to show that we want to move the city forward, whether it be liquor licenses, whether it be hotel establishments, whether it be restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5481.118s">I</a> just think we're at a great juncture to move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5484.36s">And</a> quite honestly, I just want to send the right message. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5487.061s">And</a> that Councilor Knight took the words out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5489.102s">I</a> do support the sign, naturally, but not the review at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5493.904s">It's</a> done tastefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5495.085s">So</a> if we could just sever it and then move on with the issue.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6322.809s">We</a> can ask a motion to get the update as Councilor Marks <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6326.977s">As</a> for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6327.737s">So</a> on the motion of Council Mark seconded by Councilor Musil.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6377.892s">Send</a> that to DPW, too.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6419.746s">Just</a> FYI, the sidewalks, massive sidewalk <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6426.405s">The</a> plan that's been in the works is going to be taken off within the next two weeks or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6431.069s">They're</a> waiting for that second bid to come in and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6433.191s">So</a> if you notice, a lot of them are actually getting dug out right now by the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6437.134s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6437.735s">So</a> you'll see them actively doing a lot of sidewalks over the next, until it gets cold out.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk/2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk.html">Medford City Council - August 11, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=288.721s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to move suspension of the rules for item 15-616 and also the paper in relative to the Garden Club Commission.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=362.617s">Move</a> approval on the appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=364.678s">And</a> if we could do two papers after this that are relative to the Medford Housing Authority under suspension <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=372.843s">while</a> the representative is here.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=516.352s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=518.268s">First</a> of all, congratulations on your appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=521.51s">This</a> is the most important appointment, I think, on that board, because it brings a perspective from the tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=529.254s">We</a> often hear complaints, but I've been getting a considerable amount of more complaints recently, just to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=537.098s">Tempone</a> Manor recently just had a pretty nasty assault down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=540.719s">There's</a> the ongoing drug problems in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=546.494s">There's</a> people drinking out on the steps of Canal Street when people are traversing the neighborhood, and this is public housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=553.042s">Willis</a> Ave, all you have to do is pick up the police blotter each week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=557.617s">and</a> see some of the problems that are ongoing down there and walk on court as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=562.618s">These</a> are quality of life issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=565.658s">Quality</a> of life issues that will affect the senior citizens down here at our high rises in Medford Square, as well as Bradley Road and all the other units that are under the authority and jurisdiction of the Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=577.56s">I</a> think that the leadership, as far as the executive director and the board, have to really get involved with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=586.706s">and</a> get their hands around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=590.148s">Not</a> to get too much into specifics, but one of the situations with a recent assault, another assault took place with the same people a year or two ago, and they're still living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=604.46s">These</a> are our senior citizens and our residents that deserve a better quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=609.203s">So</a> if we could just ask the Executive Director to issue a report to us on what he's doing to clean up these housing developments, it would be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=617.77s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2430.076s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2430.757s">Um,</a> the first thing is, um, if you'd allow me just to briefly discuss the $10,000, this is money that's coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2440.563s">That's</a> going to be user fees slash money from the gardeners to cap it at $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2446.247s">If</a> they're putting their own money into this revolving account, which is not appropriated through the city budget process, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2451.455s">I</a> don't see why we should be capping it at $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2454.356s">We</a> should give them at least the $10,000, the same that the artists are allowed to spend at a bare minimum, the same that the parks and recreation has in a revolving account. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2465.76s">But</a> to limit it, I don't see that being proactive for this startup. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2471.282s">I'd</a> also like to make an amendment if the council is amenable to <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2475.293s">The</a> amendment that the city solicitor made to have the Riverbend Park not part of this, I would think it would be prudent for this council to do it for three calendar years after the start-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2489.28s">At</a> some point, they should not be running their separate and distinct operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2493.662s">It</a> should encompass under the Garden Club, I'm sorry, the Garden Commission at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2499.464s">Mr.</a> Lasky and that crew has done a phenomenal job down there, but I just have a hard time <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2505.235s">keeping</a> one entity separate and distinct in the long term in the city where everything else is going to fall under this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2514.51s">It's</a> similar to a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2515.532s">We</a> can't say, well, all the schools are going to fall under the school committee except one school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2519.789s">We're</a> going to keep that under the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2521.61s">It</a> just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2523.092s">Would</a> the city administration be amenable to a three-year phase out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2528.296s">So</a> your amendment to make it so that the Riverbend Park is not part of this, that it would not be part of this for the initial three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2538.204s">After</a> three years, which is 36 months from now, they will become part of this ordinance as of that effective date.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2577.718s">But</a> we also could put the language that effective upon its passage that that particular portion expires on a specific date, 36 months from the date of passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2586.384s">I</a> just don't think it's fair, to be quite honest, and I think that the people that are already at Riverbend Park should have the opportunity to continue, but at some point, it should encompass all of the gardens in the city.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2631.635s">Unfortunately,</a> it's, um, the paper before us is your amendment that you added. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2636.417s">Um,</a> unfortunately it's the vote of the council this evening, which will send it back to the mayor for enactment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2641.399s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, uh, I just can't, um, I just have a hard time, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2646.995s">segregate</a> in one current garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2648.356s">I</a> appreciate everything that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2650.636s">That's</a> why I'm giving them, I think, reasonable as three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2654.778s">And</a> then they'll come under the auspices of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2658.86s">I</a> just look at all the parks in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2660.681s">If</a> we take one park away from the park board and now call it a separate park, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2665.058s">It</a> just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2667.0s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2668.741s">So</a> I'm going to make that motion in whatever way it goes that we either suspend it or give them 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2676.106s">I</a> feel more comfortable doing it with the 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2678.788s">And</a> I disagree with the city solicitor in this particular matter, because language is written all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2683.212s">Matter</a> of fact, we go back to the mills tax that was done here, and we put a date on it where the mills tax would be reviewed after several years and come back to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2694.722s">It</a> happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2696.082s">At</a> the state level, the MBTA now has a control board, and it expires certain regulations within the control board, expired at a certain date upon the effective passage of the legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2707.285s">So</a> I respectfully disagree with the solicitor in this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2710.826s">I</a> think that we can do it upon its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2713.667s">It's</a> 36 months from the date of its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2716.087s">And</a> I just think it's in the equity of fairness and just doing the right thing for the future gardeners that are out there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2779.072s">But</a> the city council has the right to either accept it, amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2782.753s">We've</a> made other amendments this evening, uh, to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2786.155s">So,</a> uh, with all due respect, if the mayor's paper, um, I think there's a fairer way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2791.137s">I'm</a> going to make that amendment and whatever way my colleagues see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2794.318s">Uh,</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2795.938s">So</a> an amendment that upon the effective passage of this paper, that the garden club at river Bend park, uh, stays separate and distinct for 36 months from the date of its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2806.192s">And</a> then at that point, the 37th month, it would fall under the domain of the Garden Commission, which, and quite honestly, I hope Riverbend Park helps this commission, because they've done a fabulous job down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2818.843s">This</a> is an incentive to make the whole thing work by including them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2822.867s">So</a> I make that amendment.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4368.581s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4370.782s">What</a> the candidate for office fails to recognize is this is still public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4374.993s">And</a> this was citizen-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4376.454s">This</a> is public property that the mayor is responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4379.616s">If</a> someone falls in that garden, they're not going to the five members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4384.679s">They're</a> going to see Mark Rumley for a suit.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4395.725s">Without</a> this commission, without this commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4398.972s">There's</a> no rules in place to make sure that there's fair and equitable access to the gardens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4404.314s">Now,</a> the city has a stake at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4406.194s">If</a> someone doesn't feel they're being fairly treated, they can go down here and see Diane McLeod. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4411.356s">This</a> is fairly simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4412.417s">This</a> is something good for our community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4690.216s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4690.617s">Um,</a> I want to thank Mr. Patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4692.879s">Is</a> it Patrick for coming up, but, uh, I'm going to keep the amendment there, I think 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4698.883s">Uh,</a> and quite honestly, if this doesn't work in 36 months, the audience is going to be out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4703.227s">So</a> it's not going to, it will be moved and you guys will still operate your garden off to the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4708.05s">So</a> like I said, I just think it's the equity that has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4713.415s">And</a> like I said, I cannot appreciate Mr. Lasky and his group, what they've done up to this point, because it wouldn't be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4722.242s">But</a> I don't even remember starting a revolving account for Riverbend Park way back when, when it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4730.937s">There's</a> not even public records as far as how much money comes in and out and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4735.438s">I</a> just think that 36 months is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4738.839s">I'll</a> even, for the gentleman's sake, I'll even go out 48 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4743.56s">Give</a> them four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4744.561s">I</a> think that's more than reasonable until it all becomes one.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4751.883s">If</a> the council, 48 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4755.284s">Yeah,</a> I'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4755.924s">I'll</a> withdraw the 36 months and 48 months, which is four years from the date of its passage, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4766.019s">It</a> comes down to equity, I mean, and you can't have different organizations running different public properties when it all falls under similar data.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4847.889s">I</a> respectfully disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4848.929s">I</a> don't think this is a legal decision, as the city solicitor stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4851.932s">In</a> the past, this is more of a parliamentary procedure, which would fall under the domain of the president of the council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4858.817s">The</a> motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn... No, you didn't answer that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4865.222s">In</a> the past, clearly because this is the mayor's paper you're answering.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5108.588s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5108.808s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, I know my resolution failed, but at this point, I'm going to, in the interest of having a unanimous vote for something good in our community, I'm going to vote with the rest of my council colleagues to include the language amended by the city solicitor, presented before the body by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5128.433s">If</a> the record could reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5130.034s">It</a> will. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5130.654s">So</a> all those in favor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6848.022s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6849.003s">Just</a> real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6850.184s">This</a> program originally, I don't want to talk about the program, but the parking enforcement was initiated by the businesses and residents that couldn't get parking spots in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6860.152s">You</a> drove through the square a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6862.814s">Every</a> business owner was parked all day in front of their store. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6866.627s">Matter</a> of fact, some of them were so blatant, they had their vehicles leaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6869.751s">You</a> couldn't go in and get an ice cream, or you couldn't go in and get something to eat, or your nail's done, or this or that, because they were parked in front of their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6878.962s">I</a> think what we're losing sight of is a business permit is just that, it's a business permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6884.513s">I</a> can assure you, when the days of the Cambridge Courthouse was open, you could buy a permit, but if you weren't there by seven o'clock, the cone would be in front of the garage, and you'd be riding around, feeding the meter until midday, and then you'd come out and move your car during your breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6899.197s">So</a> a permit is no way guaranteeing a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6902.357s">I</a> understand you'd like to park in front of your place all day with a business permit on the window, and that sounds easy, but the consumers need these places to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6911.759s">That's</a> what we heard from the businesses in Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6914.704s">and</a> throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6916.885s">Perhaps</a> you misunderstood.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6921.406s">Not</a> even close. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6922.167s">You</a> want to park on the street with a business permit for as long as you're going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6925.528s">That's</a> basically what you said.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6932.65s">But</a> as I said, a business permit is a permit only. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6936.892s">You</a> can have all the permits in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6938.212s">You</a> go to Davis Square and you park behind the Davis Square T Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6944.15s">If</a> you have a permit, you have to get there early, and you have to be there in time so there's a spot available. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6948.611s">Otherwise,</a> you wait outside the garage, you see a car pull out, and then you can pull in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6952.392s">I</a> mean, I sympathize with you, but the fact of the matter is, this is where this was all generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6957.173s">It</a> was by the business community, it was by the people that wanted to utilize the squares that couldn't because of the business owners parking in front of their squares all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6964.495s">If</a> we do the simple solution that you're suggesting, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6967.573s">Why</a> don't we throw the parking out, you can park in front of your business all day, and then the consumers won't have a place to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6973.018s">That's</a> where we came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6975.622s">I</a> mean, that's where we came from.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7005.238s">Okay,</a> well that's something we can take care of, and the Chief just heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7008.639s">But</a> with all due respect, when you say I want to minimize it, that's not the case, because you're talking to someone that's father, owned a drugstore in Winchester Center for 25 plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7019.323s">And</a> let me tell you, he had a business sticker, but if there wasn't a spot available, he took the gamble, and it was up to him to either pay a ticket or go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7027.886s">He</a> certainly wasn't going home and shutting the door on the drugstore. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7030.922s">He</a> certainly wasn't doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7032.603s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, sometimes with his bad heart, he'd have to park up near Stop and Shop and walk a little bit, or he'd have to park on Church Street and walk a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7040.067s">I</a> mean, I understand your frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7042.088s">But</a> the easy solution of just parking in front of the businesses on the street, that's why we're into this over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7048.931s">Let's</a> not sugarcoat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7049.972s">That's</a> why we are into parking enforcement.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7058.216s">No,</a> you're asking to park on the street
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7124.685s">and</a> Councilor Robert M. Penta, you were afforded that opportunity, as well as you and you and you and you and you and me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7131.267s">And</a> that is the lot behind St. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7132.847s">Joseph's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7133.727s">The</a> Chamber of Commerce worked diligently with this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7136.108s">If</a> people don't want to walk across the bridge to get to their business, then I just, it's a catch-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7142.049s">It's</a> a catch-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7143.45s">People,</a> people now can get a spot when they go to the doctors in Governor's Ave and Bradley Road, but <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7150.188s">I</a> mean, this was emanated when people were parking in front of their businesses year after year with names on their vehicles.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7158.813s">Well,</a> if you see that, you should be calling the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7160.674s">Or</a> call me, and I'll call the police.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7166.518s">Well,</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7167.659s">That's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7168.479s">And</a> I know you were conversing with the chief out there, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7171.021s">Did</a> you tell the chief that?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7172.822s">Yeah,</a> because I understand you, in your business, you've got to carry probably briefs and things of that nature, boxes to court.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7184.609s">I</a> wish I did, but I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7186.47s">And</a> listen, I sympathize with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7187.831s">But</a> at the same token, it was the Chamber of Commerce and the businesses that pushed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7191.974s">Believe</a> me, this is what we all hear the calls about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7194.716s">There's</a> a happy medium out there somewhere.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7198.439s">And</a> I'm here to advocate for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7200.281s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7201.802s">But</a> with that being said, the mayor, as you know, is the contract negotiating authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7209.189s">You</a> should be speaking with him regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7211.21s">We</a> can bring the message.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7217.153s">Well,</a> you being a former elected official should understand that the council is a legislative body and not the administrative authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7224.076s">It's</a> tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7224.636s">We're</a> not the executive in in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7227.057s">I</a> know at least one candidate has a plan for parking that was in the newspaper a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7232.9s">So</a> we'll see what happens in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7234.201s">But</a> at least for now, I would suggest that you contact the mayor's office and <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7239.294s">to</a> demand to see him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7240.535s">You</a> pay enough in taxes.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8159.914s">The</a> rules clearly state that commuter parking, now Councilor Marks brought up a very valid point that they may be selling them to out-of-towners, but according to the policy and the rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8171.158s">100%</a> of commuter passes are Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8174.459s">And</a> to take their parking privileges away, I don't support that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8180.661s">At</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8181.062s">It's</a> a thought process.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8427.178s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8427.618s">And,</a> uh, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8433.183s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8438.107s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8439.688s">And</a> I got to agree with Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8443.792s">I'm</a> looking at this realistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8446.495s">I</a> don't have to yell and scream about it because it's not a campaign year for me, unlike everyone else that's sitting in this room tonight, a lot of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8453.258s">I</a> look at it and try to look at it realistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8457.861s">A</a> year and a half ago, at four in the afternoon, if I wanted to go and take my son for an ice cream in Medford Square, I wouldn't have been able to get a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8466.985s">I</a> would have drove around four or five times. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8469.587s">I</a> think that's realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8470.787s">I</a> think most people agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8472.808s">People</a> are nodding their heads in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8475.725s">I</a> look now, a year later, with the inception of this program, I can't remember the last time I had to drive around to go get that same ice cream at four o'clock in today's parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8491.376s">Is</a> it culture shock, having to pay to park in the city of Medford, which hasn't had meters since the 19, I'm not even sure what year, but you look at the old photos, they had them in Medford Square in front of Stagliano's liquor store, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8504.213s">Sure</a> Pharmacy at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8505.354s">They</a> came out in 1982. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8506.275s">They</a> came out in 1982. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8509.097s">So</a> from 82 to 2014, it slowly built up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8514.282s">And</a> there wasn't a need for it in the 90s because there wasn't as many cars on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8518.706s">There</a> wasn't as much cars in each household. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8523.29s">And</a> the development has been more throughout the city too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8526.192s">Not</a> particularly in the squares, but on the outer edges of some of the areas, there's been more development. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8533.306s">Other</a> than paying to park in the enforcement piece, I think the consumers are happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8540.351s">I've</a> got to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8542.592s">Other</a> councillors may get 200 calls about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8546.435s">I</a> haven't got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8547.295s">At</a> first, it was culture shock. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8548.876s">I</a> was getting the calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8550.257s">I</a> was getting the calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8551.558s">Matter</a> of fact, I'd like to see someone's call log. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8557.046s">Someone's</a> call log of all the calls they're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8559.307s">Black</a> out the names, because I quite honestly don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8562.167s">I</a> don't believe when people are saying they're getting 200 calls, 300 calls about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8565.608s">It</a> doesn't add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8567.488s">It</a> doesn't add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8569.209s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I understand people are still getting used to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8574.49s">And</a> I understand that wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8577.191s">But</a> when some businesses say they're down 8% to 12%, I have other businesses <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8584.052s">So</a> I have no reason to not tell the 100% truth, that say this is the best thing that ever happened to their numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8593.475s">Now</a> we may shop in different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8595.475s">Maybe</a> some people tell me what I want to hear, tell another Councilor what they want to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8599.096s">But</a> I'm telling you, I have been told this by businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8601.857s">I'm</a> not making it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8603.017s">I'm</a> not making this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8605.358s">The</a> fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8607.603s">This</a> is more consumer-friendly in one aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8610.045s">It's</a> not consumer-friendly because you have to pay now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8612.526s">It's</a> not business-friendly because you can't park your car in front of the business all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8616.188s">But</a> there's also businesses out there that are happy with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8619.77s">They're</a> happy with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8621.592s">This</a> chamber has not had over 50 people in it in one night regarding the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8627.335s">Hasn't.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8628.236s">Hasn't.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8628.836s">We</a> have a city of 60,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8631.197s">60,000</a> people live in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8635.622s">If</a> the councillors get the 300 calls that they say they do, if they actually get 300 calls, God bless them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8641.766s">It's</a> still less than 1% of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8645.549s">It's</a> still. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8646.79s">So,</a> like I said, I just, I don't hear the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8650.132s">I</a> hear the young, and it's funny too, because the same people, and I bring this up when the drive-throughs come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8658.327s">The</a> same people now are stopping at these businesses because there may be parking where before they'd drive an extra three miles, drive by two Dunkin' Donuts or two banks to go to the one with the drive-thru because they couldn't find a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8668.069s">They</a> didn't want to get out of the car and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8669.949s">I</a> mean, so obviously there's some people that are happy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8674.11s">There's</a> some people that are not happy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8675.85s">But</a> that's just through my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8677.571s">I</a> mean, I'm given a fair synopsis of what I see out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8682.432s">I</a> haven't heard the <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8683.918s">I</a> mean, I can give you probably 50 emails of people that have complained about it over the six or seven months, but I'm just going by what I've experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8693.403s">And</a> like I said, I

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10799.309s">Yeah,</a> rather than, and I can understand where the council is coming from, but I don't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10805.391s">I</a> would rather have that million dollars in the bank <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10808.171s">collecting</a> interest for the taxpayers, knowing that it's encumbered for a specific reason, which is the repayment of the loan, but at least have it in an interest-bearing account, which it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10822.215s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_F9Dj7AZRD7I/2025-03-21_F9Dj7AZRD7I.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 30, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3019.973s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3023.276s">Excellent.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3025.538s">Now,</a> uh, I've taken upon myself to go to other communities that similar projects were done to see what the impact was on the downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3032.684s">Uh,</a> one in particular was the town of Winchester, uh, similar project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3037.127s">And</a> it took about two and a half, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3039.229s">And</a> it got cut down to one lane, most of the, um, project and, uh, the businesses, other than the fact that it was a pain in the neck to traverse the area, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3048.087s">with</a> police detail, stopping the traffic, that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3050.608s">They</a> said as far as the impact on their businesses, they really didn't see much. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3055.65s">Just</a> the ones that I happened to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3058.152s">With</a> that being said, are there any projects that you've done similar to this one in the general vicinity?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3089.201s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3090.342s">Um,</a> the second thing, um, I have a question about is the, uh, the maritime conditions and the locks and things of that nature because, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3098.655s">The</a> boating community is concerned about the locks being opened and manipulated for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3105.277s">Do</a> you know if there's going to be an impact on the riverway, as far as that goes?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3113.359s">No,</a> not the locks here, but the Amelia Earhart Dam. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3115.9s">Is</a> the water level going to stay the same and everything, or are they going to?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3145.614s">And</a> that leads up to my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3146.955s">The</a> DCI vote can certainly help out your cause by slowing the flow up at the upper and mystic <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3153.222s">lakes</a> because that's brand new. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3155.424s">It</a> was done over in the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3157.425s">Members</a> of the DOT that are here, I'm sure, are familiar with that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3162.088s">So</a> it's actually good that that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3163.91s">And</a> interesting enough, the Winchester Bridge was a result of some of their downtown flooding problems as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3171.435s">So</a> there's a lot of moving parts to this whole project that we don't necessarily see. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3176.148s">The</a> other thing is I'm confident that the direct abutters will be appropriately represented given the fact that you're putting the monitoring systems in. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3188.593s">And</a> I would hope that they all take part in it and have an independent insurance person take a look at their conditions prior to this process starting. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3199.637s">And</a> last but not least, Councilor Pentland hit on it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3203.162s">but</a> the environmental impact on the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3206.904s">We</a> have a lot of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3208.064s">As</a> you said, the city has water lines under there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3212.306s">Is</a> there going to be any negative environmental impact during demolition? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3216.988s">Is</a> there going to be booms set up and everything that contain everything right there, or netting under the bridge that's going to catch stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3222.63s">What's</a> in plans?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3263.078s">We're</a> going to lift these large pieces right out and set them on a truck and take them away. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3268.522s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3269.262s">And</a> at any time does this job call for a barge under there as well to either rebuild or demo?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3292.014s">My</a> last question is just to follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3294.476s">Actually,</a> from the drawings and the research that I've done with this particular project, going under the bridge there, it actually looks like it's going to be a lot better. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3305.162s">Naturally,</a> it's going to be more aesthetically pleasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3307.52s">but</a> it's going to be more open and voluminous when you're on the west side of the bridge looking down river towards Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3318.486s">It's</a> actually going to improve the image in the sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3321.408s">And</a> I know that's a very, that's a big area where a lot of people throughout the community utilize to take pictures, whether it's wedding pictures, this, this, this and that type thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3328.632s">And</a> it's, it's more open right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3331.674s">People</a> that haven't seen it or been up close. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3334.548s">There's</a> only a small area where boats go through and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3338.07s">It's</a> going to be like the Longfellow Bridge almost, but much smaller, naturally, the arches.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3351.537s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3354.859s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3355.659s">And</a> last but not least, I know this is very nerve-wracking for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3360.802s">I</a> mean, the traffic the last two days has been <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3364.044s">very</a> bad, but that was because of the Winthrop Street project going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3367.027s">That's</a> because, um, this project that's, that's just getting underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3370.991s">But,</a> um, I, I tried to look back to some of the complaints, um, that the city received years ago when they did the route 16 bridge over down near metal Glen mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3381.261s">And</a> that was a bigger bridge and, um, it actually took, uh, took a substantial amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3387.867s">But,</a> uh, overall, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3391.075s">It</a> wasn't directly in the business community, but it was close enough that it could have an adverse effect on the Metal Glym Mall and Century at the time, and Mystic Valley Tower was north. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3400.079s">But</a> it was pretty good overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3404.321s">And</a> that was the Department of Transportation slash DCR joint venture at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3409.124s">So</a> I'm confident that if we all work together that this can be done, and it has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3417.387s">And</a> that's the part that <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3419.013s">people</a> are failing to realize throughout the square and throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3422.494s">If</a> this doesn't happen now, the price is just going to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3426.476s">And</a> inevitably, there could be someone resulting in injury or fatality down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3432.179s">I</a> mean, when they're putting up yellow caution tape for people not to walk over a bridge, something has to be done or cordoning off certain areas of a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3441.102s">But</a> this is being done for public safety and no other reason, quite honestly, because I know the state wouldn't want to be spending the money either. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3447.558s">if</a> it didn't need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3449.439s">But</a> I want to thank you for your presentation and look forward to working with you on this project.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10999.081s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank you as well as Mayor McGlynn as he presents his final budget to the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11008.587s">Once</a> again, this is a budget that is going to provide city services at a level that I think is sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11016.832s">I've</a> been a member of this council when times were really, really tough and when times were really, really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11024.376s">Right</a> now, we're basically at a point or a juncture that <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11028.069s">Things</a> in the city are moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11030.571s">And</a> I'm proud to say that that was a collaborative effort, Mayor McGlynn and the city council, the school committee, the superintendent, and all the magnificent department heads and employees that we have here in this very building. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11046.741s">But</a> as I get ready to vote on Mayor McGlynn's final budget favorably, and I'm only one of seven members, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11055.818s">One</a> thing that did stick out to me was the statistics on the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11059.96s">And</a> it looks roughly about there's about 34 to 33,000 transactions at the meters throughout our community a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11070.885s">And</a> that's a pretty impressive number. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11076.008s">And</a> when you go to look at the citations and the citations collected, the number seems to be going down in the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11083.298s">And</a> I think that's another interesting piece of data that we were presented from Mayor McGlynn and his staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11093.997s">With</a> that being said, this is a good solid budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11097.899s">I'm</a> very, very happy that the mayor agreed with this honorable body and funded the substance abuse prevention coordinator for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11108.303s">I</a> think it's a position that is much needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11112.624s">I</a> think everyone on this council supported it when I first brought the idea forward and the mayor took it to one <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11122.523s">One</a> step further, another level, and he made it a full-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11126.006s">So</a> certainly, I'm proud of that, and I think that that's a legacy on this entire council, because we initiated it here, and hopefully it's going to be a position that turns out to be a lifesaver when people are ready to utilize the person that's awarded that job in the very near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11145.901s">But</a> with that being said, I think the school department budget is a very solid budget, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11150.345s">The</a> superintendent pointed out <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11152.83s">the</a> money that's being spent in maintenance and in repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11157.453s">The</a> superintendent also pointed out that the lump sum checks or the lump sum raises that some were saying were $60,000, a significant amount of money, were actually bonafide employment opportunities where people took new positions, is that correct, superintendent, that were publicly posted and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11179.397s">So</a> just to clear up some of the confusion on that, because I get some phone calls from people in the school department saying, where did these jobs that are referred to on TV, where are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11191.905s">And</a> so I'm thankful the superintendent gave us that in-depth report as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11197.729s">But</a> like I said, I think that this is a solid budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11201.911s">I</a> was prepared to vote on this budget last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11207.12s">after</a> the final budget deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11209.382s">But,</a> Louise, you did a fabulous job on your first budget, your first of many budgets, hopefully, here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11216.528s">Either</a> that or you'll be doing purchasing, I guess, because you have your contract as our purchasing agent for the next several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11223.113s">But,</a> like I said, we're at a juncture in our community right now, Mr. President, where we're, in a very short period of time, the faces and names of <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11236.236s">A</a> lot of elected officials in this community are going to be changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11239.679s">That's</a> factual at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11241.82s">And</a> it's really a good opportunity to keep the city stagnant and moving backwards or forward or wherever the voters may see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11249.986s">And</a> with that being said, I think that this is a solid, solid budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11254.91s">And</a> I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11256.151s">And</a> hopefully it gets voted on favorably. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11259.293s">And</a> the personnel throughout the community can get back to work tomorrow knowing that the budget is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11266.809s">And</a> I really don't have anything else to say about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11270.09s">But</a> I want to thank the department heads, and particularly Louise Miller, Superintendent Belson, and Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11277.653s">You</a> know, he's been around, and this isn't a Mayor McGlynn, Ra-Ra speech at all, but he's been around when times were tough around here and when times were good. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11286.236s">And</a> the city services were always a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11291.598s">And</a> the city services, where they are, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11294.52s">28</a> years ago and a lot added and not cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11299.942s">So</a> for that, and it was really good to always support a budget too with no trash fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11306.925s">Like</a> our neighboring community of Malden, we were still able to get through another budget cycle without that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11311.407s">So</a> there's a lot of positive stuff happened over the past couple of years under Mayor McGlynn's watchful eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11319.771s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12344.936s">These</a> are all proposals that were brought <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12349.564s">through</a> the chain of command, and ultimately the decision was made with Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12354.526s">If</a> he wanted him in the budget, he would have put him in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12360.249s">This</a> is, and just, I'm going to wrap up, but it's kind of ironic because the council wants to keep adding to the budget, adding to the budget, adding to the budget, but every time we have a paper before us to add something good, he votes against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12374.375s">So</a> it's, it's just, I'm finding it kind of ironic right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13424.006s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13427.368s">I</a> assume, as in years past, this will be funded out of the water and sewer account with a vote of the Council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13435.974s">This</a> is very much done. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13437.616s">It's</a> rudimentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13438.436s">It's</a> done all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13439.757s">It's</a> been done in years past.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13552.0s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13553.86s">One</a> thing that anybody that's a good manager would look at at this point would be if there's been any changes in the system that we've used. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13564.362s">And</a> there's been a major change. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13566.123s">as</a> a result of this council advocating for a tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13570.766s">The</a> tiered rate system started how long ago?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13577.731s">So</a> that's, I'm assuming where we don't know where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13583.635s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13584.156s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13585.127s">And</a> that's a direct result. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13586.307s">But</a> this is Management 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13588.128s">This</a> is something that we have to learn from this because we don't know at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13592.55s">We</a> don't know at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13594.01s">So</a> I'm very comfortable knowing that we've funded this in the past out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Accounts, which has certain regulations and standards that the money can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13605.434s">And</a> this is certainly an appropriate use when necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13608.575s">But</a> to say that it's 117, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13612.83s">I</a> assumed right off the bat it was because of the tiered rate system, and that's why I wanted to pose the question to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13620.853s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13664.836s">And</a> we only have authorization to cut the budget, not line items.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13748.128s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, this particular line item, I don't feel comfortable reducing it at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13758.475s">That</a> money that's in the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13760.773s">could</a> be used at a later time for other accounts if the city council sees fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13767.317s">Money</a> from the water and sewer enterprise accounts could not. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13770.199s">So</a> let's say we have another real bad year, like we've had this last winter, where the snow and ice was outrageous, just based upon the climate that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13781.346s">Right</a> now, when it's in the budget, it can be used to offset the snow and ice, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13785.809s">It</a> cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13786.809s">It</a> cannot, even if it's the budget line item.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13812.224s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13812.524s">So</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13814.345s">I</a> had the wrong understanding on the budgeted side of things compared to the account that the money is in. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13818.907s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13819.368s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13820.773s">It</a> was, I apologize for misspeaking on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13824.234s">But</a> with that being said, I still, the tiered rate system, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13829.775s">We've</a> advocated strong for it, this council, and we may have to make up money on the water side because of the assessment with this new tiered system. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13838.337s">I</a> mean, we got the answer from Mr. Kamara, who gave us a very detailed response last week in our packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13845.378s">So</a> I'd just like to sever those votes, that's all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14461.345s">He's</a> going to cut the budget and then vote against the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14470.401s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14472.643s">Couldn't</a> run a lemonade stand.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14501.567s">A</a> yes vote is to strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14504.088s">A</a> no vote is to leave it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14505.508s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14505.768s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14506.169s">I</a> just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14507.569s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14507.629s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14508.57s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14509.33s">Councilor</a> Caraviello?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14529.819s">What</a> was the roll call on that, on the first item? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14532.96s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14534.561s">4-3,</a> and it failed?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14609.382s">Thank</a> you for all your hard work.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14721.472s">This</a> is the outreach coordinator.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14725.408s">We</a> just voted for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14727.209s">We</a> got it earlier today.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14730.692s">Well,</a> maybe you just didn't keep up to the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14732.913s">I</a> just got it tonight, Paul, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14734.674s">Well,</a> we all got it earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14736.415s">You're</a> the only one that always has problems.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14870.154s">Same</a> as Ernest Lindsay.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14988.959s">The</a> job is going to be filled very, very soon.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15129.345s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15142.838s">It's</a> already in the budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15174.322s">We've</a> all been advocating for this, putting it off for longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15177.204s">I</a> mean, the overdoses just keep going up and up and up in the city.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15185.267s">Hey,</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15186.588s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, it's a position that we all advocated for.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15259.637s">Council</a> has been sitting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15266.503s">June</a> 16th, we've been sitting on it, dishonorable bodies since June 16th.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15292.637s">But</a> we don't approve job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15294.878s">We're</a> overstepping our boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15297.3s">Job</a> description is administrative role. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15300.202s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15300.822s">If</a> you guys don't want to support it, don't support it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15304.845s">There's</a> a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15306.065s">Yeah,</a> that's the only role we have is putting it in their classification personnel table. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15315.945s">Take</a> the vote if you don't want to support it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15433.246s">Of</a> course it can.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15441.588s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn asked to this be tabled until we got the description. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15449.469s">That's</a> how we're at now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15519.264s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15520.545s">As</a> we all know, the city- I have a point of order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15525.707s">Talk</a> about it next week.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15531.65s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15536.052s">Mr.</a> Villion won't have his TV station.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15885.779s">I</a> don't know if the Councilor may have forgot, but didn't we as a council vote on a moratorium for this particular reason?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16148.366s">Mr.</a> President, while we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16150.846s">While</a> we're under suspension, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16152.827s">I'd</a> like to take 15-424 and talk about community access.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16171.991s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16172.992s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16175.671s">As</a> we all know, we're getting the new Medford TV station up at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16180.694s">And</a> it's going to be pretty exciting that the city is going to be moving forward finally over the next nine months or so with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16192.588s">And</a> if we could just ask the school department to get an update, not on the building, because I'll speak about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16199.172s">That</a> was section 22 a few minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16201.914s">But</a> I would like to ask the school department to see where they're at as far as getting the station up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16207.978s">I</a> know it comes after the construction.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16211.26s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16229.799s">And</a> I certainly agree with Councilor Marks, because there's going to be people that can't go to this station because of their quarry, because it's in the school, where if it was in Medford Square or somewhere else, it might not eliminate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16239.746s">But</a> with that being said, if we could get an update from the school department on how's it going and who they plan on putting in charge of it, and just basically an update on the new station.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16279.118s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16280.458s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Poulos. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16284.1s">It's</a> not on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16285.32s">The</a> paper that was section 22'd a little bit earlier was to get an update on the moving forward, but we can't talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16292.503s">So</a> it's not on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16293.283s">That's</a> incorrect.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16314.926s">A</a> developer wants to go up there, you said? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16317.867s">I'm</a> confused.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16554.997s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16555.658s">Thank</a> you very much, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16557.158s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16558.059s">I'd</a> just like to remind the viewing public that it was Councilor Penta that fought the charge to shut the access station down. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16564.462s">So</a> it's kind of ironic, once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16568.918s">There's</a> many emotions he brought forward, and the record doesn't lie.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16609.44s">Mr.</a> President, if I may just conclude, as I stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16613.711s">The</a> Councilor wanted to get rid of public access and now he's a proponent.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16637.598s">We</a> don't need personal tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16640.119s">You're</a> on your last leg here, councillor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16648.924s">It's</a> only begun.

There has been not one person, other than the library group, that came up here on this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5355.2s">On</a> this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5356.34s">This</a> is a budget that's adding several key components that this city council's pushed for over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5362.957s">They're</a> working on a dog park right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5365.259s">They're</a> working on the substance abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5368.823s">Coordinator</a> is in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5370.485s">Code</a> enforcement officer is in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5373.128s">The</a> superintendent of schools is adding adjustment Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5376.772s">We</a> haven't seen adjustment Councilors in how long, Mr. Superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5381.477s">Quite</a> a long period of time.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7540.059s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7541.88s">The</a> dirt was addressed by the due diligence of Councilor Marks already.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7580.54s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7581.62s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7582.601s">Well,</a> I look at this a little bit differently than Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7586.362s">The</a> need for this isn't just the business, it's the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7589.543s">It's</a> the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7590.623s">If</a> you go 10, 15 feet right next to this new development, you have Dunkin' Donuts that opens at 5 a.m., and they also have the business right behind it that is cooking all night long. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7600.367s">So</a> in today's day and age, I know the council has been here for a long time, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7604.485s">drive-through</a> is a fairly new thing but people actually drive right by Dunkin Donuts in other parts of the community to go to a drive-through similar to the bank I know more people that drive right by Brookline Bank down in Medford Square or in West Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7617.193s">to</a> go to the drive-through because they have children in the back seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7620.055s">So</a> just to be with today's day and age, I don't have any problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7624.939s">I</a> think it's good for the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7627.261s">And</a> quite honestly, if they don't have the demand and it's not the consumers that are using it, then they're going to push the hours back, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7633.345s">So</a> this is going to be consumer-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7635.647s">And</a> this is why this is something that is a good, positive thing for economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7640.811s">This</a> is not something that was around in the 70s or in the 80s, but today in 2015, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7646.842s">This</a> is something that people look for, and this is something that I think I do support, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7653.486s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7654.047s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8050.956s">Thank</a> you, and you brought up a very good point regarding a lot of the other establishments that have extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8058.058s">I</a> would say the majority, well yes, at least two-thirds of this body, has supported extended hours and has been very economic development friendly when it comes to special permits, the majority of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8072.922s">With</a> that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8074.778s">I</a> don't recall one coming back to us for a show cause hearing on a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8079.282s">The</a> only show cause hearing I can remember in recent times was the pawn shop up on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8088.371s">So,</a> I think this is a great economic development paper and I'd like to have a roll call vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8093.476s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8151.055s">Councilor</a> Cluso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8151.836s">I</a> think we're all aware of very, very nice people that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8156.78s">We</a> all received the calls over the last few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8160.26s">And</a> no one works harder to keep their neighborhood a great positive area to live in than the gentlemen that were just spoken about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8171.008s">I</a> am fully confident that with the reviews that they'll be happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8175.631s">And</a> if not at that time, then we'll look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8177.972s">But</a> let's look back to when this was A&W, when it was a pretty lighted area, this particular parcel, and it was vacant for <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8187.126s">three,</a> four, five years to the point where people were coming to this honorable body complaining about the weeds and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8194.872s">So</a> I just, I don't take lightly their phone calls and they're advocating for their neighborhood, but this is in the best interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8203.819s">And</a> at some point within three or six or nine months down the road from the inception of it opening, if there's problems, we will deal with it appropriately.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8224.975s">There's</a> obviously a time lapse, too, from you meeting with them a couple months ago to them calling all the members of the council over this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8231.54s">So</a> there's a time lapse. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8233.041s">And</a> people do change. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8234.562s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8235.022s">And</a> get after them about the dirt.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8519.516s">Just</a> to clear the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8521.052s">I</a> stand by my comments, and I was talking about Councilor Penta's 30-plus years of service, and the drive-throughs are fairly new. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8527.415s">He's</a> been around here for 30 years.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8815.932s">Councilor</a> Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8818.033s">Yes,</a> Inspector Brady, very well respected in the Medford Police Department, but also throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in his rank as detective. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8829.64s">He</a> certainly made Medford proud, but he also <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8833.064s">did</a> a lot after his retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8834.585s">He</a> was doing private investigative work, and he was often called upon by law enforcement agencies, still, even in retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8842.972s">So</a> I want to send our condolences to him and his family, and his son-in-law, Chris, who worked in this building for many, many years, up until about three or four months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8854.121s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8935.207s">Motion</a> to table, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8945.091s">I</a> got to get questions answered.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9284.429s">Mr.</a> President, as we're all gearing up for reelection, can we get this question answered as to the status of the station?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9512.286s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9514.847s">The</a> city was represented by legal counsel at the hearing, who specifically, that's his job, representing the city in a contract with cable providers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9525.913s">So</a> the city did have representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9528.694s">And</a> from my understanding, there wasn't many people that participated in it, unfortunately.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9551.108s">That's</a> what his input was. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9551.969s">The</a> counsel is incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9553.149s">He</a> was here representing the city to get the input, to see what the people of Medford, that are cable rate payers, would like to see included in a successor agreement.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9675.127s">Yes,</a> I'm going to talk facts now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9677.247s">The</a> facts are the city of Medford put out a bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9679.628s">There</a> was, I believe, one individual that put in a bid <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9685.157s">that</a> currently doesn't have a corporation or a company. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9690.419s">And</a> it's, I'm assuming, still under review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9692.539s">The</a> second piece of it is, we are getting a studio and it's going to be up at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9698.521s">Up</a> at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9699.361s">Representative.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9713.439s">Mr.</a> President, if I may continue talking facts, if I may continue talking facts, they did make an announcement with the director of the vocational school, Representative Donato, I believe Ann Marie Cunha was at the event, as well as Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9730.623s">Subsequent</a> to that,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9746.846s">Mr.</a> President, they are working on the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9750.648s">I</a> actually visited the area where they're putting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9753.148s">And</a> my question is, if we're going to have people go into that building, I want to make sure that they're corey cleared and taking precautions to protect our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9761.151s">And</a> they're actually putting out they're putting out <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9765.821s">They</a> may possibly put a door leading directly into the studio so that they don't have to traverse the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9771.726s">So</a> like I said, I just wanted to bring a couple facts to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9775.068s">And</a> it's always good to ask the question, as I stated a little earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9779.251s">But</a> also if we can get an update from Louise Miller on the one person that did put in for the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9785.696s">It's</a> some entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9788.26s">But</a> I don't know much about the person or entity, so if we could get a report back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9792.463s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9816.967s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9819.048s">If</a> I may, are you the person that put in the bid? <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9821.468s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9823.449s">This</a> is news to me.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_sB_5XTIqkQk/2025-03-21_sB_5XTIqkQk.html">Medford City Council - June 16, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=47.499s">I'd</a> like to move suspension of the rules to take paper number 15-541.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1649.855s">I</a> don't know why we're making this so hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1652.897s">Why</a> don't we approve it as it is, and just ask the mayor to appropriate $75,000 from the free cash that we have right now, and it will be over with. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1663.425s">This</a> is very basic stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1665.066s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1668.422s">And</a> it accomplishes the same exact goal legally because the way it was presented, you can't do it because it's not going to be certified till the end of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1679.81s">And</a> furthermore, that's when you can do it as of. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1683.572s">By</a> the time the division of local services get back to us, it may not be certified as certified free cash until October or November. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1690.568s">correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1691.228s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1692.149s">This</a> is basic stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1693.29s">Uh,</a> I would like to make a recommendation that, uh, any requests for funding to the streets and sidewalks, which are in desperate need of repair, uh, is made, uh, to the mayor, um, to come back to this council for approval of taking out of certified free cash that we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1709.199s">Therefore,</a> we don't have to wait, uh, until this is, this is very simple, a mass municipal finance law. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1714.602s">I'd</a> like to make that motion.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2094.593s">That's</a> totally incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2096.695s">It</a> will not go to free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2098.476s">It</a> will become free cash if we get to the end of this budget year and there is a positive balance in that account, and then it is certified by the Department of Revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2108.144s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2109.065s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2109.865s">There's</a> no other way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2111.547s">There's</a> no other way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2112.908s">This</a> is very basic mass municipal finance.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2117.432s">You</a> can finish, but tell the truth.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2186.336s">And</a> that was Councilor Camuso's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2188.037s">That's</a> what I asked to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2189.818s">And</a> if we needed additional money to pull it out of certified free cash, what the council is asking to do cannot be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2196.881s">It</a> cannot be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2198.622s">And</a> the louder we get isn't going to make it to be able to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2202.064s">It's</a> not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2203.085s">It</a> can't be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2204.23s">The</a> budget director right here, that's an attorney, just explained to us that it can't be done the way he's presenting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2209.433s">And</a> I'm not here to be confrontational. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2211.595s">I</a> just, I want to do it the right way.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2225.023s">Whatever.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2227.405s">Come</a> on, come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2230.241s">It's</a> frustrating.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2276.001s">You</a> didn't say it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2278.541s">You</a> didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2279.201s">You</a> didn't, Robert. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2279.961s">Watch</a> the tape.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2470.722s">That's</a> true. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2471.063s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2472.023s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2473.044s">And</a> I have to agree with my colleague, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2477.298s">If</a> this was being transferred for maybe other DPW accounts, it would make it a little bit more palatable, but given the condition of the roadways and everything else, now I obviously realize that this $75,000 and the other $80,000 that is in the account is going to be used to pay for police overtime and other services that were actually already given and rendered. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2499.851s">So,</a> I mean, I understand that, but just like Councilor Marksley said, given the state of the repairs in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2505.873s">I</a> would have liked to have seen the DPW have made it a priority to spend this money, even if it gave relief to just a couple areas of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2516.244s">But</a> like I said, move approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2519.927s">And</a> motion to sever.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2586.768s">If</a> I could, the amendment that was presented to write a check for the $75,000 was just answered by the budget director that it cannot be done the way it's presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2598.693s">So</a> if the gentleman's willing to remove that, otherwise I'm going to request a roll call vote because the question was asked and we did receive an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2609.918s">To</a> transfer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2610.898s">Just</a> a motion for approval on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2616.036s">No,</a> my motion was to ask the mayor to come back with another paper requesting money out of certified free cash that was certified 2014 last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2625.465s">Mr.</a> President, I'd be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2630.65s">Well,</a> if you leave it under the account, it's not going to be certified until October and November of this year.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2693.002s">So</a> on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2695.203s">And</a> I'm still asking for the severance due to the fact that $75,000 is going to pay for some of the other items on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2704.904s">Police</a> salaries, which is currently in the arrears for $270,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2708.965s">So</a> it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2710.786s">That's</a> why I think the cleaner way to do it would be requesting the mayor to certify free cash to do the potholes, which he could do like this if he wanted to.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2856.61s">Mr.</a> President, I know that sounds good, but according to mass procurement law, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2865.342s">Councilor</a> Penta wants to spend the money in July and August, and we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2869.463s">Services</a> have to be rendered by June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2871.603s">That's</a> state procurement law, correct, Louise? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2875.124s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2876.284s">So</a> July and August is not an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2878.445s">June</a> 30th, the services need to be rendered by.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2885.126s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2887.626s">To</a> strike.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3230.31s">Roll</a> call vote on the amendment.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3611.318s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3613.999s">And</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3614.579s">I</a> think we have to move forward on the common victuals this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3617.5s">You</a> know, I'm extrapolating a lot of data right now from the city council for the last 12 years of this Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3622.995s">I'm</a> going through every single permit that was brought before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3626.776s">And</a> as far as being business friendly, I'm surprised at a lot of the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3630.657s">I</a> think that the prudent thing to do this evening is to put forward the convictionless license, which anyone is entitled to if they're working within the confinement of 7am to 11pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3645.263s">And</a> if he wants extended hours or anything, then it's an issue for another day.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3766.871s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3767.092s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3768.232s">And</a> whether it's the city clerk's office or the building department, I really don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3773.134s">The</a> gentleman has on his application 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3775.774s">to</a> 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3778.788s">This</a> should have been amended before it even got to this honourable body, as Councilor Mack stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3784.116s">Wherever</a> the ball got dropped, obviously the first place that this particular document got dropped off was our city clerk's office, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3790.907s">And</a> it shouldn't have went any further out of there with hours that were not conforming, or the hours should have been highlighted, so the building department could have picked it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3799.511s">But</a> I certainly agree with Councilor Marks, and this is a problem that I'm seeing all too often as I look through previous records.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3809.856s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3810.016s">The</a> votes are staggering.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4424.81s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4425.631s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4426.591s">Thank</a> you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4427.692s">And</a> I agree with the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4429.673s">I</a> think we should have a breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4431.254s">But</a> Councilor Penta misspoke on one piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4433.735s">And</a> that is that it's not a firefighter that they're taking off an apparatus or anything in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4438.928s">it</a> is actually overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4440.909s">So</a> we definitely want the answers of why it's going on in the breakdown, but to say that it's coming from the fire suppression team, basically pulled out of his regular job, it's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4452.175s">So</a> I just wanted to clarify that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4479.609s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4480.69s">If</a> I may go back, and I've been watching the tapes the last few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4485.032s">I'm</a> keeping the tapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4486.493s">And</a> interesting enough, tomorrow I'll report back to the council next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4490.015s">But</a> you said that you're taking them away from his firefighter duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4494.177s">And</a> when I look at that, <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4496.238s">I</a> say that that's taking it away from peace throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4499.899s">So</a> I agree with the councillor, but I don't want people to think we're taking someone off of a fire apparatus for this particular item. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4508.162s">That</a> was what was said. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4509.102s">I</a> just want to clear the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4513.524s">That's</a> all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4579.368s">I'd</a> like to, if the councilor doesn't mind amending it, to get an update from the school department on when they think the master box will be connected back to the fire alarm system, because that's actually what's going on up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4592.093s">It's</a> an old system trying to tie in with a new system. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4594.554s">So</a> if we could get an update on when they think it will be complete.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4623.324s">I</a> actually misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4624.384s">It's</a> not overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4625.105s">It's</a> actually a paid detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4626.525s">I</a> was referring to my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4627.685s">It's</a> a paid detail, an additional body that's not on the fire floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4632.347s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5593.626s">Councilor</a> Caruso. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5595.046s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5596.147s">And</a> I agree with the philosophy, but limiting it to any number, I think, is disadvantageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5605.109s">Quite</a> honestly, I don't know how the gentleman arbitrarily come up with that number, but I think this should be off of the same list as maybe reduced lunch in the public schools, for instance, because that 301 family that may want to go to Wright's Pond, and we're going to say, no, we're sorry, we can't allow you to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5622.801s">I</a> just think they should look for a better way, if there already isn't a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5627.342s">I'm</a> not really sure, to be honest with you, if there isn't a way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5632.723s">If</a> they're already doing it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5639.585s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5806.74s">And</a> also, I'm not quite honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5808.901s">I'm</a> not sure who is the authority of air rights over the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5813.084s">Would</a> it be the Zoning Board of Appeals? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5814.465s">Would</a> it be the DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5815.985s">Can</a> we ask this to the, and when we're talking about air rights, we're talking about the proposed walkway over Boston Avenue and down at the Tufts College Ave T-stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5827.99s">So</a> if we could send this to the city solicitor on who the appropriate authorities are over air rights, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5835.574s">This</a> is a unique situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5838.876s">I</a> can't think of any other businesses that currently or private property that do this at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5944.664s">As</a> the records of last week's meetings were sent to- For the records, just for the viewing public, City Hall will be closed tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5952.988s">So</a> just, I think it's in honor of Bunker Hill Day.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6036.37s">We</a> voted to have that part of the budget debate.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_JknWFpZeyhQ/2025-03-21_JknWFpZeyhQ.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 9, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2761.364s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2763.985s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2765.566s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2766.707s">And</a> I just want to thank everyone in the community that's been involved over the past... This isn't just the last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2771.509s">This</a> has been over about a month or so, that the emails, the groundswell behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2777.432s">And</a> I was ecstatic today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2780.95s">when</a> I spoke with the mayor and his staff around noontime, when he committed the additional funds based upon a couple of new developments that are coming online with new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2790.458s">And</a> it's just a financial commitment to keep the library just not only in a better financial situation than it is today, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2802.229s">But</a> as the gentleman said a little earlier, it's going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2805.572s">And</a> I asked a similar question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2807.273s">And</a> you don't want to be in the same boat as we are now next year, when the new mayor has to look for additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2816.881s">And</a> so I'm glad we were able to get to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2819.323s">But</a> I really want to thank the people that were patient, because government doesn't work so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2825.996s">We</a> had to wait until the additional new growth not went online, but there was the actual commitment for the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2834.142s">You</a> know, week after week, it's easy for people to say, we want this, we want that, we want this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2838.085s">But</a> ultimately, you have to pay for these city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2841.228s">And</a> this council has been committed to doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2844.41s">And</a> like I said, this wouldn't be possible without Mayor McGlynn and his top administrative staff, because we can only approve the budget or cut the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2853.357s">We</a> cannot add to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2854.97s">So</a> I just want to thank him for his commitment to the children and the residents of our community here in this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2863.333s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3771.405s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3773.027s">If</a> I may, two years ago, we lost a great person, and that was Governor Cellucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3779.011s">And</a> he was very instrumental here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3782.513s">He</a> lost his battle with ALS, I'm sure most of us are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3786.035s">And</a> I'd just like to adjourn this evening in his memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3789.018s">You</a> know, the one thing that I remember specifically about Governor Cellucci, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3792.987s">was</a> I had the distinct honor of being sworn in by him 16 years ago at the Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3800.729s">It</a> was when I first got sworn in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3802.529s">And</a> one thing that was evident was his ability to work with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3807.291s">Whether</a> you were Mike McGlynn, the Democrat, staunch Democrat for years, or at the time, people like our senior member, staunch Republican, he worked with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3819.094s">Worked</a> with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3820.247s">He</a> was friends with Republicans, friends with Democrats, and he just was a really good guy, and he helped Medford a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3826.432s">So</a> I'd just like to keep his memory alive by adjourning this evening in memory of him who passed away two years ago.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3920.333s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3921.113s">So</a> on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3921.993s">And</a> if I may, before, as Councilor Penta said, for Councilor Penta to run the campaign here as a Republican in Medford, for him to win by six votes, it's unheard of, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4710.623s">Thank</a> you, and I appreciate the gentleman at the podium's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4717.365s">Over</a> the past several, three or four weeks, it's been discussed that it's gonna go, it's gotta go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4723.567s">Where</a> are we gonna fund the $800,000 from? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4726.168s">That's</a> the question, because it's gotta go is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4729.189s">I</a> think this council took a vote that we'd like to see it go, but you have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4733.27s">We</a> have a library that was looking for $250,000 this evening to just maintain <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4740.977s">status</a> accredited and to be, not accredited, but to be part of the Minuteman Association, $800,000 of taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4749.342s">Where</a> are we going to take it from? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4752.444s">And</a> don't say that we'll just take them to court and get out of the contract because that's...

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4825.481s">So</a> the five that he just mentioned, there's not one that would, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4829.044s">put</a> us out of the contract in a reasonable person's, um, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4834.687s">But</a> the rhetoric saying we can just get rid of it, this and that, we have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4837.729s">I'd</a> just like to know where, because, because bring something forward, tangible, where the dollars and cents are going to come from, and then we'll look at it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4874.808s">So</a> is that going to be your answer to everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4875.928s">I</a> would mitigate it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4877.728s">So</a> your answer to everything is just going to be pay to stop this, pay to stop that? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4880.609s">No,</a> I said I would mitigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4881.629s">The</a> city would be bankrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4882.289s">I</a> said I would mitigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4883.01s">The</a> city would be bankrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4883.67s">I'm</a> not going to argue with you anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4884.77s">Well,</a> I know, because you don't have a leg to stand on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4886.23s">It</a> just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4888.111s">Councilors,</a> let's focus on the subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4891.352s">As</a> I said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4893.045s">Back</a> to the gentleman, I'm just sick and tired of the rhetoric saying let's get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4896.433s">We</a> need a tangible something to get rid of it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4921.52s">Councilor,</a> you brought these minutes to the city.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4924.742s">Mr.</a> President, I have the floor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4927.546s">Don't</a> be disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4930.391s">I'm</a> glad Councilor Marks brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4932.133s">It</a> was him and his committee that he sat on for many years that said we need to have parking enforcement number one and parking meters.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4990.357s">Councilor</a> Camuso was the president at the time when I made the motion to have parking meters at the final meeting and not kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4997.62s">So</a> if you want to just throw out stuff that's not true and inaccurate, listen, you've been doing it for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5001.842s">People</a> are catching on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5002.582s">The</a> numbers are going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5003.763s">But</a> that's, but that's, we'll see if you're here November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5007.264s">But</a> with all due respect, Mr. President, with all due respect, this council voted unanimously for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5013.408s">It's</a> a valid question to ask a colleague of mine where he's going to get the money to get out of a contract.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5062.646s">So</a> what difference should I make? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5063.706s">Why</a> should I think about what he said? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5065.286s">As</a> I stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5069.419s">There</a> are valid concerns out there, but it's thrown around. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5072.221s">This</a> is the fourth week in a row that it's been thrown around. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5074.062s">We're</a> just going to get rid of it and do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5075.623s">People</a> in the community want to know where we're going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5077.465s">Are</a> we going to take it from the library funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5078.866s">Are</a> we going to take it from the school's funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5080.167s">Are</a> we going to take it from the police? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5081.447s">Where</a> are we going to come up with the $800,000 plus to have them take a walk? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5086.371s">That's</a> a legitimate question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5088.152s">And</a> if the Councilor feels uncomfortable getting a question asked, then guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5092.315s">I</a> don't know what to tell him. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5093.316s">It's</a> unfortunate, but back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5095.177s">You</a> say you wanted to get out of it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5111.014s">I</a> had an idea, and I didn't present it yet, but we'll see soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5114.475s">Because</a> with all due respect, with all due respect, with all due respect, I brought the motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5122.757s">I</a> had five members of this council support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5127.098s">But</a> the councilor that sits across from me wants to talk about it week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5130.921s">He</a> hasn't made a tangible effort to bring forward a plan to get rid of it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5140.187s">As</a> I said... Thank you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5148.853s">I'll</a> wrap it up, but the request that we had was for the mayor to get out of this and to come up with a plan <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5155.127s">Councilor</a> Penta's throwing it out without a plan, so be it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5551.949s">like</a> to address a few things to the gentleman because he may walk around South Medford but as a councillor and I think most of us as councillors have heard positive feedback regarding this program from some businesses whether it's in West Medford whether it's in Medford Square where they've had their strongest March and April that they had in all time now I'm not gonna throw those businesses out there I know the mayor's done that on one occasion and I <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5577.613s">I</a> didn't think it was quite fair to that particular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5580.296s">But</a> I know for a fact that the loudest member of this council to get rid of this program has been told by a business owner that it was the best march they have ever had. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5592.226s">And</a> there's a business owner right here, right now, that's marched over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5595.628s">Well,</a> Mario, as you campaign across the city, you're going to understand, there's many people in this community with different philosophies, different feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5602.994s">And</a> the majority of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5604.075s">Well,</a> the majority of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5604.835s">Would</a> you talk to 200? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5605.336s">The</a> majority of them are saying that this program sucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5607.938s">With</a> all due respect, with all due respect, as you're entitled to your opinion, I'm entitled to my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5614.743s">And</a> there is people in this community, business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5618.746s">You're</a> not talking to all the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5621.015s">in</a> this community, throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5622.397s">People</a> that are on second floors, that are not on street level, that have their massage parlors throughout the squares, throughout other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5629.345s">You</a> are not getting the phone calls that this council has dealt with for the last 10 years of people parking and taking the bus all day, living in their neighborhoods like Damon Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5638.365s">like</a> Winthrop Street, like Boston Ave, like High Street, like Boynton Road, the gentleman nodding his head right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5643.809s">You're</a> not privy to those conversations, because you're not an elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5647.05s">Now,</a> if you're successful in your endeavors, maybe you'll see the many different sides of every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5653.594s">But</a> to say that everyone's for it or against it, it's fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5657.396s">It's</a> fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5658.197s">That's</a> not my rhetoric. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5659.437s">I</a> can show you emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5660.438s">I</a> can show you phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5662.739s">You</a> walked South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5663.66s">I</a> know you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5664.66s">I</a> know you have, because people have told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5666.241s">But</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5668.546s">There's</a> a portion of the community that— My rhetoric wasn't that every single person disagrees with it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5911.385s">Councilor</a> Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5912.145s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5913.125s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5915.066s">And</a> I know for a fact that a poll was done regarding major issues in this community and parking fell well below number four, followed behind education, economic development, um, senior citizens programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5932.795s">And</a> that is factual to fall down that far on the <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5940.192s">totem</a> pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5943.653s">It's</a> speaks volumes and I'm going to leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5950.494s">But</a> so we just heard that no one's for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5954.875s">No</a> one's for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5956.335s">But</a> one lady that's come up here and spoke eloquently that we don't see at the council meeting every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5960.996s">I</a> think this is the first time I've seen her at the council meeting and she's been here longer than all of us cause she was here for five 30 for the library meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5968.215s">But</a> this is a regular, average citizen that pays an enormous tax bill on Damon Road, and she just gave her feelings on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5975.941s">So</a> for everyone to say that there's no one that's for this, this is why I caution people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5981.805s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5983.847s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6258.499s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6259.119s">And</a> I'd just like to add one more point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6261.7s">The</a> city of Medford, we all do know that we get those robocalls from the Captain Clemente. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6266.562s">There</a> was a robocall that went out to this entire community regarding the parking meeting that this Medford City Council was holding in room 207, right over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6274.967s">A</a> robocall, 57,000 people, many, many homes, and the meeting fit right in that room.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6291.696s">I'm</a> sure, Mr. President, that the <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6296.673s">I'm</a> not going to speak for anyone else, but I'm sure if the city administration wanted to, they could probably get the data back up that says either his phone was an answer machine or it was hung up on because they do keep records of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6308.165s">So</a> I'm sure for zero summit road, if they go back and look at that robocall, they'll be able to tell the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6312.951s">But</a> with that being said, um, here's one last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6318.304s">I'd</a> like to get an update of all the revenue collected through these machines, because for every one person that it's acting up on or is having a hard time, there's another 10, 15, 20, whatever it is, used it successfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6333.393s">So</a> I'd like to know how much they've taken in so far through the Park Medford application on the cellular phones that I know is becoming very popular, as well as the meters itself.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6360.652s">And</a> one last point is too. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6362.612s">Yes,</a> Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6365.574s">Most</a> of the majority of the people that are working there, this has been another <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6370.653s">Misinformation,</a> more than half of the employees there are Medford residents from this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6377.136s">So,</a> and God forbid one of them falls down and does get hurt now or something like that, throws out their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6382.618s">It's</a> not on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6384.239s">It's</a> on the vendor, but there are Medford employees that are doing most of the jobs down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6389.902s">And</a> other Councilors around this real can back me up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6396.105s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6517.92s">One</a> piece of data that I would ask you to get maybe is the mills tax compared to last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6522.481s">And</a> there was an increase in mills tax over the winter in the city of Medford and the whole first quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6528.782s">So</a> that's data that backs up your theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6531.022s">Present</a> our comments through the chair please.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7119.206s">First</a> of all, the names are in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7121.307s">The</a> names of current employees are in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7123.248s">They've</a> been in our budget for years, four or five years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7128.091s">That's</a> the first thing.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7132.694s">No,</a> no, I'm quite familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7134.095s">I'm</a> also quite familiar with the attempted assault on a public employee that was, that was, what's the word I'm looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7144.562s">That</a> a shooting subdued after, in that the Joint Terrorism Task Force actually ended up shooting someone <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7151.315s">in</a> Boston, in Roslindale, and then they had another situation in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7155.318s">And</a> to blatantly put out this type of information, employees' addresses, and things of that nature, I don't think is prudent at this point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7163.485s">We</a> all know it's public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7165.827s">But</a> even addresses of employees, I believe, may not be public record under the public information law. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7172.193s">But</a> with that being said, I can't support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7175.235s">The</a> names are in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7176.536s">But</a> asking for employees' addresses, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7178.885s">I</a> think it stinks of nothing more than just wanting to have them for your own personal database, and there's no value to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7184.427s">And</a> given the situations we're dealing with currently around the greater Boston area, with some serious criminal police matters in the neighboring community of Everett and Roslindale, and possibly even within the general immediate area, I don't think I'm comfortable asking for this type of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7204.974s">Police</a> and fire are already protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7207.074s">They're</a> not in the ward book. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7208.015s">They're</a> not listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7209.114s">And</a> I just don't feel comfortable doing this to any public employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7212.156s">If</a> someone has a specific interest, they're more than welcome to come down here and get any applicable data through the Freedom of Information Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7219.119s">But</a> I'm not supporting this for those reasons.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7411.213s">Just</a> a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7412.854s">Has</a> there been any actual raises in the same title, or was it promotions to different positions? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7417.896s">Because</a> if there's a raise of $6,000 to $20,000, these are more, the people I've talked to in the school department said, most of them are putting in for different jobs, getting a promotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7428.721s">I</a> mean, it's called anti-spiking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7430.842s">It's</a> against the law.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7620.701s">And</a> raises.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7652.76s">No,</a> just a roll call vote on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7725.2s">And</a> the schools has traditionally put retirements in the front of the budget as well as new hires in the front of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7732.785s">And</a> jobs that have not been filled yet show the word vacant with a salary attached to it just because it hasn't been filled yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7738.729s">But</a> to follow up on Councilor Knight's <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7741.671s">um,</a> statement regarding teachers and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7745.336s">The</a> more I think of it, I'm a little less apt to, uh, to support it even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7749.642s">Now</a> in Danvers, we had a young teacher calling Ritza. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7754.849s">Oh,</a> excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7756.891s">No,</a> you didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7757.572s">This</a> is, this is all departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7760.222s">be</a> forward to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7761.623s">This</a> is administrators, this is asking for secretaries and everyone else in the whole system wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7768.589s">And</a> we had a situation and we didn't, but the city of Danvers had a situation where a student was following around a teacher, uh, around her place of home and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7778.738s">And</a> we know the ultimately what happened there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7780.8s">So</a> I don't feel comfortable with this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7782.542s">It's</a> in the budget, the same information that has always been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7785.724s">And,</a> um,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7790.058s">It</a> says school department.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7809.623s">And</a> I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7810.283s">You're</a> gonna be a real- Then don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7811.264s">You</a> don't have to make a, forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7812.984s">You're</a> gonna be a real good leader.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8495.083s">Raises.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8496.344s">It's</a> about 99% of the employees get the raises, as Councilor Longo said. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8500.688s">The</a> Secretary's got a 1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8504.451s">So</a> everyone got a raise, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8507.533s">We</a> want every single job description of every single employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8510.355s">I</a> mean, that's the way this reads right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8533.565s">Can</a> I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8534.326s">Where</a> does it say lump sum? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8535.326s">Am</a> I missing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8536.627s">That</a> was an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8537.327s">If</a> you paid attention, you would have heard it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8539.248s">The</a> lump sum amendment was on Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8543.498s">I</a> think we're going to get a blank piece of paper back, because these are fictitious, these promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8547.84s">I</a> mean, they're promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8548.721s">They're</a> not just raises.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8550.782s">No,</a> we're not here to obstruct the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8552.422s">This</a> sounds more like a union issue at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8555.204s">Councilors.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8563.087s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8632.083s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8633.063s">Yes,</a> Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8634.184s">We</a> have some people that have been waiting very patiently in the back for Councilor Penta's paper on the rights.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9389.816s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9390.777s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9391.817s">I</a> certainly don't like to see any fees raised, as all of us do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9396.061s">I'd</a> like to know, when did the park board actually increase this? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9401.085s">And</a> if we could get the minutes of the park board, because they're the statutory authority that actually approved this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9407.57s">Secondly,</a> I'd like to find out when the last increase was. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9411.626s">Because</a> I'm sure if it was done three years ago, if we could also get the minutes from the three years ago when it was increased by the park board as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9421.597s">So</a> we can just take a look at it, also see what it's costing to run it now as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9425.12s">I</a> know that they were looking a few years ago to possibly put one of the fountains to keep the water running like Felsmere Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9432.61s">And</a> I'm wondering if, uh, if that's still in the plans and if this is to offset the cost of some of that, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9437.774s">So</a> if we could ask the park board, um, board when they did it and what the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9443.659s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9445.02s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9600.934s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9601.334s">I'd</a> also like to, uh, Councilor Penta doesn't mind, um, ask for an answer to back from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9606.719s">I</a> know they were looking at, uh, a year ago when I proposed it, uh, sprinkle a park and it's that time of year again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9612.283s">And</a> the parents at the Brooks school the other day were asking, Hey, is that going to come to fruition? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9615.686s">They</a> heard about the dog park and this and that, and they're not seeing that get off the ground as quick as some people would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9621.451s">Um,</a> but the sprinkle a park, I know there's a huge, huge, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9626.226s">portion</a> of our community that would love a sprinkler park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9628.548s">Malden</a> just opened up another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9631.01s">They</a> had the ribbon cutting a few days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9634.692s">So</a> if we could get an update, because I think that that's something that will be incredible in this community, a sprinkler park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9642.478s">And</a> it's something that doesn't cost a fee to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9645.44s">And</a> just the parents absolutely love them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9648.863s">People</a> actually leave Medford to go to the DCR one over in the Belmont line. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9653.206s">That's</a> how popular they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9655.417s">Thank</a> you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9656.037s">And</a> I'd hate to be behind Malden on anything.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10427.62s">Can</a> we also ask the status if there were or if they intend to have any increases at Tufts pool?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10440.223s">But</a> I'd like to get it from the park board who raises the rates because once again, we will add that to the motion because normally they go part and parcel, the lifeguards and the, what do they call them? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10450.305s">Not</a> park rangers, attendants, bath attendants, park attendants and the park police. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10455.178s">No,</a> park rangers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10456.679s">Mike</a> Penta just got promoted to lieutenant.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10462.42s">Mike</a> Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10522.514s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10523.955s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10524.976s">If</a> I may too, if we can congratulate Michael Penta, who was just promoted in our community to lieutenant of the Medford Park Ranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10535.105s">Michael</a> Penta has been a very good employee for about 15 years.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11008.907s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11010.088s">I'm</a> assuming at this point this has been talked about between the different agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11014.877s">I</a> think this needs to be done and something in writing has to be disseminated to the state police if they approve it, as well as the Medford police. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11023.161s">My</a> concern is if they do not open up Route 16 to the smaller trucks, you're going to have these trucks going down Summer Street to evade the congestion during the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11035.587s">They're</a> going to be going up South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11037.068s">They're</a> going to be going through Forest Street, Lawrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11039.969s">They're</a> going to be going everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11042.743s">Street</a> that can handle it the most is Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11045.424s">And</a> as we're all aware of, Route 16, you can't have any trucks on the DCR roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11050.846s">So</a> during the Craddock Bridge construction, I think it just does make sense to do this to alleviate the neighborhood traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11058.069s">The</a> roads are certainly bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11059.83s">I</a> know in the past, the concern has been some of the trees and things of that nature years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11065.052s">But</a> I just think it's going to, if we don't look into this and have something in writing, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11071.926s">We're</a> going to just add more confusion to the neighborhoods, and as Mr. D'Antonio said earlier about the parking, just going to keep pushing it back, pushing it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11079.688s">George</a> Street, then onto Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11081.868s">So</a> by this simple approach, I think we can help alleviate some of the side street traffic.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11137.094s">Like</a> I said, I'd rather see them go down route 16, Mr. President, than coming through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11141.476s">We</a> all know Councilor Marks a few years ago had a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11143.837s">Just</a> the trash trucks can't get through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11146.366s">In</a> the morning, there would be a bus and a trash truck, it would be total gridlock. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11150.287s">I</a> just think, I understand Councilor Caraviello, he's got a very good point, but we're asking for trucks to start going down streets like where you live.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11163.209s">Well,</a> right now the state police are pulling over any truck that has a box on it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11176.032s">Come</a> 2 o'clock, you just can't get out of that parkway anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11178.654s">Yeah,</a> no, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11179.554s">But</a> I think it's better off than getting them down the high street and everywhere else.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11389.893s">Mr.</a> Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11390.773s">I</a> think Councilor Lungo-Koehn has a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11393.554s">I'll</a> send this to that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11397.474s">And</a> like I said, this actually presented itself from people on Harvard Street in South Medford that are concerned about the trucks that we gave them some alleviation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11406.361s">And</a> now they're concerned that it's going to be back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11409.643s">And</a> when I thought about that, you start thinking about Spring Street again and Riverside Ave, where the trucks have always been a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11416.048s">So</a> I want to thank Councilor Alango-Kern for offering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11419.33s">I</a> think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11420.891s">And</a> I'll move this paper to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11423.113s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11423.513s">So</a> on the motion of Council, it was to table this until that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11426.736s">Well,</a> not to table it on the council agenda, just forward it to that meeting, forward it to the committee of the whole, because if it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11433.269s">It's</a> a presentation on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11435.611s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11436.652s">Even</a> better. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11438.413s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11440.274s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11440.675s">I</a> apologize.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12059.828s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12062.49s">The</a> majority of the city council has been very supportive of the transgender issues here in our community, as well as just opening up in full and equal access across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12074.06s">We've</a> made some significant strides in this community over the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12077.623s">And</a> I'd just like to go on record in supporting Boston Pride Week and continuing to have an all-inclusive community for everybody.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12093.99s">Yeah?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12096.771s">Well,</a> it's Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12099.332s">Boston</a> happens to be this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12102.734s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12103.894s">Ask.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12104.695s">You</a> want to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12108.563s">have</a> our own week, Medford Pride Week.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12116.545s">And</a> I think, I think Medford has done a significant job in this particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12121.427s">As</a> I said, the majority of the city council has supported tremendous movement forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12127.508s">The</a> bathroom issues at the Medford public schools that were discussed here, as well as many other things over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12133.87s">So</a> we have a proven track record as a council.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_B5fALLGbAKg/2025-03-21_B5fALLGbAKg.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 2, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1353.482s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the neighbours and especially Mr. Fitzpatrick for coming here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1360.447s">You</a> know, this is going to be a major impact on our community, and this City Council, under the resolution of Councilor Marks, actually worked with our Chief of Police to put up some sort of structure on the Medford side so that it's not only somewhat aesthetically pleasing, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1379.43s">but</a> also just to cut the flow of traffic as a cut through. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1382.992s">I</a> remember for many, many years when it was the Malden hospital, it was a cut through and it'd be thousands of cars per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1389.315s">Every</a> change of shift at night, ambulances coming up there and just, it was, uh, it was chaos in the residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1396.719s">And</a> it wasn't like our hospital that is abutted by Lawrence road, governor's ave and forest street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1401.021s">It</a> was small little, uh, homes on a, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1404.522s">streets</a> that's traversed by two vehicles, and you can't even fit a car parked on the side when two vehicles are going by. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1410.126s">So</a> it's a big difference when an ambulance is going through there with the lights on, not necessarily the siren, because when they get to that point, they'd always shut it off, as the neighbors know. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1418.032s">But</a> the red lights and everything else would light the whole house up. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1422.556s">With</a> that being said, I think we have to be very cognizant of the fact, Mr. President, that this is a city of Malden project. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1429.381s">Malden</a> has the <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1433.805s">We're</a> all and be all as far as getting the vendor slash developer into the table and actually can arrange an agreement with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1444.893s">Where</a> Medford, we're limited because the amount of housing and developing happening on the Medford side, if they do it consistent with the current zoning and they don't have to go to the board of appeals, there's really nothing Medford could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1459.684s">If</a> it's scaled back to the point where it's going to <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1464.126s">where</a> it's going to fit within our zoning ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1467.628s">But</a> I think we should send a resolve to the City of Malden, the Mayor Christensen, as well as to their City Council that we do want to work with them, same way Malden and Everett worked with us during station landing in Somerville, and as well as the City of Medford working with the Stoneham development up at the New England Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1486.775s">We're</a> cognizant of the fact that some development is going to take place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1489.556s">Quite</a> honestly, I talked to several of the neighbours and they're just sick and tired of seeing the vacant building. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1493.518s">They</a> said they have rodents going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1495.939s">There's</a> people that sneak in and try to take it over living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1500.381s">And</a> unfortunately, it's not conducive to a good quality of life as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1504.583s">So</a> I think we just got to send the message in a nice tone that we want to work with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1508.885s">We're</a> interested in seeing good, prudent development. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1512.227s">But</a> at the same token, we have to understand that Malden <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1515.145s">is</a> the driving force behind this, and they're the only people. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1518.086s">Now,</a> Malden, we'll have to realize that the city of Medford could take them to court and tie up the job for 10 years if they wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1525.547s">But</a> we don't want to spend our taxpayers' money if we don't have to as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1530.929s">So</a> I think we just have to send a message that we understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1534.049s">And</a> as I said, you look at some of the developments that we had in our community over the years, and the surrounding communities did not take us to court, worked with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1542.771s">But</a> we were very amenable sitting down with them, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1545.534s">talking</a> about traffic flow and things that we could do as our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1550.216s">But</a> I think we have to do that with Malden and at least send the message that we're on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1554.798s">Our</a> neighbors, our taxpayers are very concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1558.68s">And</a> as long as we're all on this city council, we're going to continue to monitor the situation, but most importantly, send the strong message that we want something a little bit scaled back, number one, and number two, something that's not going to affect <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1573.459s">the</a> runoff, because I've seen projects like this where people that live in an area don't have groundwater coming through their basements, and then you do a project of this magnitude, next thing you know, the next storm, they have groundwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1584.346s">It</a> just changes the whole flow of things, stormwater, runoff water. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1589.05s">So</a> I just want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1593.913s">It's</a> something that we've all been following. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1597.543s">I</a> think we have to be very cognizant of the fact that it is Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1601.746s">And</a> I mean, there is small groups in Malden that are saying they don't want a project at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1606.149s">And</a> quite honestly, I think that's unrealistic, because you're better off having to say something that you get there than someone coming in and saying, hey, we're going to make this whatever, something that conforms to zoning, but not something you want in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1622.3s">Certain</a> types of medical facilities and things like that that people would prefer not in the heart of their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1627.752s">And</a> right now, and here's the other thing, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1631.073s">You</a> want to have the developer at least come back with a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1634.353s">If</a> he's not interested in doing it any way except the way he's doing it, then he should tell them all that, hey, I'm not interested and move on and let the Hallmark Health go out and look at the whole situation again and see if they're interested in other opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1647.996s">And</a> so that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1649.896s">And</a> I just want to thank everyone for coming down tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1652.577s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1653.837s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1974.255s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1975.275s">One</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1975.755s">Mr.</a> Kelty, why are you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1978.702s">I</a> see that you cut back significantly, and it's a nice plan you brought forward, but do you have any developers in mind that if it's not necessarily this developer who would actually come forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1988.948s">That</a> would have to be found, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1990.508s">I</a> mean, we haven't shopped that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1992.429s">Okay,</a> because I mean, to arbitrarily, and I'm just playing devil's advocate here, because you want this to work for our neighborhood and your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1999.013s">I'm</a> concerned about the Medford side, to be quite frank with you, but from a standpoint of getting a developer in there, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2007.779s">I'm</a> just being realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2009.862s">Developers,</a> you're going to see little interest, probably, with the scope of the work cut back by
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2050.265s">And</a> like I said, it sounds great in theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2053.167s">It's</a> certainly better for the neighborhood, but I think at the same time we just have to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2059.332s">We</a> have to sharpen our pencils and see where the money is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2061.233s">Because</a> if we're not realistic, it's a waste of everyone's time to sit at the BB school or any school for that matter and come up with a great plan that sounds good, but <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2069.032s">If</a> you don't make it to the point where the developers want to come in, then you're going to be sitting looking at a vacant building with the temporary still fence around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2078.982s">That's</a> ultimately not the goal, I don't think, for Malden or Medford, because quite honestly, many neighbors up in that area are sick and tired of the transient people trying to break in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2088.892s">The</a> police are there all the time breaking in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2090.673s">There's</a> rodent problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2092.965s">It's</a> coming to the point where it's bad.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2122.724s">Yeah,</a> I'm sorry So the if Hallmark takes it down then we're dealing with a different situation because but now you've got a different animal We will be getting calls if that's a vacant lot now, and I'm just based upon my experience here You'll be getting calls from the neighbors in Medford and Malton if it's a vacant lot <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2137.621s">That</a> there's kids drinking there every weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2140.223s">So</a> it's, as I stated earlier, the best thing for both communities is to probably come up with a realistic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2146.808s">Because</a> I know there are people in Malden that are dead against it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2172.651s">Because</a> the Medford side, we will, Medford working with the developer, I think significantly the project was already cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2179.919s">From</a> the original one, as far as the housing and those things going on in the Medford side, it's been scaled back, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2185.026s">I</a> don't know why it's not happening in Malden, but... For this one or other projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2189.372s">For</a> this particular one. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2190.273s">I</a> think this one because they don't want to fight two battles, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2192.416s">Well,</a> yeah, and they know the Zoning Board of Appeals probably wouldn't go along with it, but there's...
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2218.762s">I'm</a> just very cognizant of the fact, we've dealt with schools in Medford, believe me, that sat for 30 years, vacant buildings right in the heart of our neighborhoods here. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2226.783s">There's</a> people in the audience that know the buildings I'm talking about, and it just, it's not a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2231.284s">How</a> long has Malden been closed now? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2232.584s">Probably</a> since 1999, 2000? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2233.504s">99,</a> so it's been 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2236.865s">Yeah,</a> so it's quite a long time, but all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2240.806s">And</a> I know that just to knock that down and get rid of it and get rid of the material and stuff is about three or $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2248.932s">just</a> to knock it down, just to get the trucks in here and abate it properly, and you're dealing with asbestos and everything else with it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2316.866s">We've</a> seen it many times in this community We're gonna raise a ton of dole for this project that project that guess what at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2321.708s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2322.648s">It's</a> back before the city council from the mayor looking for a bond because it sounded good. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2327.35s">They</a> were going to raise half a million dollars on their own to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2330.251s">And</a> eventually it just didn't take off the way it was going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2334.132s">That's</a> why we're not relying on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2336.153s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2336.894s">So</a> yeah, we have, we have all the options. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2340.415s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2341.615s">And</a> um, I just like to make one motion and that is to go back to council of Marx's motion, um, of several months ago, which I think is the biggest piece of this puzzle for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2351.487s">and</a> that is we do not want the opening at the end of the road leading into the Malden development to create the chaos and the havoc that was here post-1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2361.652s">So</a> if we could just send that resolution again, if Councilor Mark sees fit, where he was the original author, would you be okay with that, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2369.235s">Send</a> that right to Malden and say that that's something that we need in order to be working with the people on this project.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2702.21s">I'm</a> very sorry to speak again on this issue, but these plans were put forward by you, Mr. Kelty. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2707.974s">Did</a> you draw these ones?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2726.16s">The</a> new cut-through that's proposed on, the new proposal is diverting the traffic from Lund Road, now to Murray Hill Road, and then to Falz Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2736.931s">I</a> think, uh, I know he, I know they talked, this says new cut-through, that's why I'm a little, I think that was just conceptual.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2758.637s">Oh,</a> OK.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2760.197s">It's</a> just where you were showing us these boards, and I thought that this was the title.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2769.519s">Which,</a> that's where the traffic commission comes into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2772.219s">I</a> just thought it was part and parcel of all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2775.28s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2832.669s">Thank</a> you Mr. President and I want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Penta for for joining in and having this resolution for a wonderful person. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2842.554s">We're</a> all friendly <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2844.234s">here</a> with the Brennan family in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2847.196s">I</a> had the distinct pleasure of chatting every Tuesday night with young Timothy after our council meetings and he'd be giving me the critique in it on how we all did it on the evening and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2861.706s">The,</a> um, Timmy, I remember way, way back when, when I was a little kid, Timmy was a little older working with Marilyn Perica's campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2869.03s">We</a> were just little kids walking the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2870.752s">That's</a> when, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2872.23s">Councilor</a> Penta was a councilor back in 87, 88. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2878.033s">And</a> I remember seeing all the councilors, and it was a great race. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2882.294s">And</a> I just remember Timmy walking the streets, and we were just young kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2886.376s">Then</a> fast forward to 1997, I was lucky enough to have worked with Timmy in his work to get on the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2896.921s">Ultimately,</a> Timmy landed his dream job, and that was with his dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2902.174s">uh,</a> was Bob as well as his three brothers, Tom, Eddie, and Jimmy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2906.717s">And</a> that was a firefighter in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2909.399s">Um,</a> many people didn't realize that, uh, Timmy has been sick for a little, little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2916.143s">And,</a> um, ultimately the, um, he, uh, gave a valiant fight and unfortunately, uh, last Tuesday evening when we were wrapping up our city council meeting here, uh, Timmy passed away at the mass general hospital with his family by his side. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2931.402s">So</a> just if we could send our condolences to Helen and the three boys, and if we could dedicate tonight's meeting in honor of Timothy Brennan, Medford firefighter from Engine 4, that we're going to sorely miss at the young age of 46. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2945.665s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2947.565s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4834.723s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4835.824s">And</a> this has been presented to us over the many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4841.887s">And</a> my stance has always been and still shall be that this was citizen driven, as Jean Martin said, in 1986 and 87, a very active group of community members went out and they got the signatures and they put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4859.137s">And</a> if people are committed to changing the charter in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4862.565s">then</a> that is the process that I feel is the way it should be done, same way that it has been done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4870.37s">So</a> for that reason, I do not support this, but I certainly think that the charter review is a good thing, but I just don't like the mechanism of doing it opposite the way that it was done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4883.878s">It's</a> something that has such a great drive in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4892.653s">to</a> move the city forward, that I just think it should be citizen-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4897.976s">Quite</a> honestly, if we were to just do it with a flick of a pen on a Tuesday evening, it's an insult to everyone that worked so hard, including Councilor Penta and Mary-Anne Frazzoli and many, many other people back in 1986. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4912.403s">So,</a> that's my reasons and that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4915.245s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7274.848s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7275.488s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7277.182s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on this evening for the two of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7283.464s">Kenny</a> Nesta was a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7285.245s">Many</a> people would not only know him from the baseball field, but as a retired post mailman. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7291.027s">Did</a> the West Medford route for, I'd say, 20 plus years or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7295.548s">And</a> then in his golden years of retirement, he was a custodian for the Malden Catholic Lancers over at MC. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7302.75s">So</a> just a great, fantastic guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7305.407s">has</a> wonderful kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7306.908s">One</a> of them is our PAC superintendent, Mike Nesta, another great kid and loving grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7312.191s">And</a> just, he's gotta be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7313.352s">Just</a> an all around good guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7315.753s">Thank</a> you, council.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_50f-AMbGHtg/2025-03-21_50f-AMbGHtg.html">Medford City Council - May 26, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1095.949s">Thank</a> you, and I can certainly understand the frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1099.191s">My</a> home is right underneath one of the paths, and it seems like every weekend it's coming from the Winchester line right over the large Memorial Hospital into Logan. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1110.38s">And</a> it is... <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1113.795s">It's</a> louder some days than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1115.156s">When</a> the bigger planes, the 747s, are either taking off or landing, it's a lot louder than some of the smaller A320s and some of them double-engine planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1125.963s">I</a> certainly agree with the resolve in looking in to see if there's some mitigation money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1130.025s">But</a> I also am very cognizant of the fact that Massport's first and most top priority is for the safety of the flights in and out of Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1139.111s">And</a> I'm sure they'll work with us any way they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1141.675s">But</a> this is a catch-22, this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1144.796s">For</a> the same reason people are paying a large amount of money for their homes here in our community, it's because of its proximity to Boston, to the airport, to the financial district, and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1156.521s">So</a> it's sort of a catch-22, shall we say. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1159.703s">I</a> know Councilor Marks championed this issue many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1162.904s">He</a> was on the front page of the Boston Herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1164.925s">I</a> think it was the Herald, was it, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1167.886s">With</a> this very particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1169.782s">And</a> as I said in my conversations with Massport officials at the time, and that was about three or four years ago, I believe, more than that, as Councilor Mark says, they understand the frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1181.647s">And</a> if we do meet a threshold in certain areas of the community, then there is sometimes funding out there to do mitigation within the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1192.212s">I</a> know Winthrop receives a lot of money for the homes right in Winthrop, East Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1199.003s">But</a> like I said, unfortunately, I don't want to underestimate the severity of the noise, believe me, because I understand it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1212.067s">I</a> have a five-year-old, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1220.052s">It</a> is seven miles from Boston, and this is one thing that we have to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1225.055s">Maybe</a> not with the volume, but Boston, it's an international airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1230.177s">It's</a> not like Lawrence or Hyannis Airport where you get flights every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1234.76s">We're</a> an international airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1236.18s">You</a> look at these planes, and they are low. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1237.941s">You</a> can read them, Lufthansa, Alitalia, and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1242.684s">So</a> I'm more concerned about the safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1245.767s">Like</a> I said, quite frankly, right after September 11th in the year 2001, there was an airline accident that happened right in New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1255.831s">And</a> it wasn't terrorist, it was mechanical failure or something of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1260.172s">But</a> it was, it landed under mechanical distress or whatever it was, in a very populated area that was homes and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1271.957s">So</a> as I understand it, and the other thing is too, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1275.088s">As</a> the gentleman that comes up here weekly with his little tablet looking up web pages said so eloquently, he alluded to the fact of the winds. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1286.752s">The</a> planes have to take off into the wind in order to get off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1291.794s">So</a> with that being said, a lot of the takeoffs are predicated upon the wind and the weather and all that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1300.697s">But</a> I certainly do agree with the studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1303.56s">that</a> Council Marks brought up years ago, and Council Lungo-Koehn again this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1307.183s">So</a> I do support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1309.024s">But</a> I just, as I stated, I'm not going to repeat the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1314.128s">And</a> I've heard that many people in the community this weekend at the coffee shop stated, because they read the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1319.591s">And</a> they were a little bit like, hey, when I moved to Medford from Salem Mass, I knew I was paying $575,000 for my home to get closer to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1330.139s">And</a> this was one of the setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1333.342s">But</a> I certainly understand all the frustrations out there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2916.419s">The</a> library has a parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2919.331s">directly</a> adjacent to the building, and I drive through that street quite frequently, and it butts it directly, there's always available spots in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2928.695s">Just</a> a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2930.516s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4071.839s">On</a> my first point is you had Eversource here as a result of Councilor Marks bringing the issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4081.146s">So</a> I applaud you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4083.007s">And</a> my second point of information is we did have representatives from the bridge here about a year ago, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4091.674s">Twice</a> in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4094.196s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4094.837s">And</a> at that point they stated that there won't be any mitigation to businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4102.126s">even</a> though this council did ask for it, they clearly stated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4105.847s">So</a> I don't want businesses to think otherwise.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4221.79s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4225.412s">That</a> was the Department of Transportation representatives that were here meeting with this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4231.317s">Clearly</a> stated that the state does not pay mitigation on projects, but what they do do <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4238.419s">is</a> pay for any damages to any public or private entities that are damaged as a result. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4245.664s">That's</a> a big difference, mitigation and physical damage.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4266.949s">We</a> can throw out the red herring, say an MWRA or any other agency he wants to. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4271.952s">They</a> are not a state agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4274.654s">The</a> MWRA is a separate and distinct authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4277.975s">It's</a> an authority like Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4279.376s">It's</a> an authority like the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4281.417s">Their</a> rules, their laws are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4284.428s">The</a> Department of Transportation clearly stated this to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4287.591s">They</a> said it right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4288.451s">If</a> we have to go back, rewind the tape, maybe the council forgot what they said. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4292.134s">I'm</a> not responsible for what he remembers, but I'm responsible for what happened here. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4295.878s">And</a> that is clearly what was said. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4297.479s">The</a> state does not pay mitigation on public projects.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4378.183s">Mr.</a> President, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4380.004s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4381.493s">to</a> say that there was no public meetings, it's fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4384.515s">It's</a> fiction, once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4385.915s">We</a> had a meeting here with the representatives from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4392.358s">One</a> of them's name was Donald Daly, and I don't remember the other gentleman's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4397.701s">What</a> was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4398.281s">Paul</a> King. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4398.982s">Paul</a> King. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4399.882s">They</a> were here at a 7 PM meeting of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4403.944s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4404.845s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4405.425s">So</a> to sit here and say that there hasn't been public
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4468.429s">Yes,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4469.79s">The</a> bus routes are going to go, the main bus route. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4473.931s">I</a> don't know if the councillor took the time to reach out to the correct officials as I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4478.426s">but</a> the bus route is going to be moved.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4496.699s">Uh,</a> as I stated, if the Councilor doesn't want to go over and above, as I have over my 16 years of public service, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4503.402s">reaching</a> out to the particular people that can make, rather than yelling and screaming in hot air, can actually make the bus stop moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4510.404s">They</a> are moving it across the river over near the bridge and hopefully it will be a permanent home even after the construction project with a nice greenery and maybe a bus shelter that Councilor Marks brought up before. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4523.069s">So</a> I am doing some talks with the appropriate people. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4526.93s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4527.839s">Number</a> two, I'm going to revert to a conversation I had with the councillor just a week ago, who was adamant about a former member of this council not bringing up the beer and wine.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4545.563s">It's</a> a pattern of your fictitious mind.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4557.907s">As</a> I started to say, Mr. President, earlier in his dissertation this evening, he said there was no public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4563.768s">In</a> fact, there were two public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4565.549s">This,</a> I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4566.869s">And</a> the public meetings were in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4567.809s">This</a> is 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4570.31s">and</a> we had one here at the Medford City Council, not in 2013, I will get you the exact date, but it was right here, the gentlemen were here, it was the first meeting, the first item agenda, I believe, and it was a very, very good meeting, and they emphatically stated, I mean, if you wanna make up the rules as you go along, like you've done a long time.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4591.5s">As</a> I said, Mr. President, if he wants to let people believe there's mitigation available and set people up for failure, that's his responsibility.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4623.637s">There</a> was one today that he didn't go to.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4669.935s">So</a> Mr. President, if I just can finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4671.836s">Councilor</a> Camuso has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4672.977s">And</a> I'll wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4674.198s">And</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn is 100% correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4677.68s">There</a> can be lawsuits, and there probably will be lawsuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4680.423s">But</a> the fact of the matter is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on this particular matter is the Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4685.445s">does</a> not pay mitigation for two businesses as a result of public works projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4693.451s">If</a> that was the case when they did the central artery and took down all the green space in there and did the Rose Kennedy Garden, the disruption, Mr. President, the disruption is lousy. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4706.601s">And</a> I understand that completely, completely.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4730.658s">And</a> Mr. President, precisely, it was a public works mitigation that went to the city of Boston, not to the businesses that were directly affected in that area, like Faneuil Hall Marketplace and <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4745.487s">Well,</a> businesses property get taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4748.693s">But</a> like I said, the city, I'm sorry, the state, they said that at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4754.515s">This</a> isn't fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4755.575s">This</a> is factual, what the state said to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4758.597s">Now</a> if the law changes, I hope it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4761.258s">I</a> hope it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4762.358s">But</a> like I said, I think our biggest thing right now is doing everything in our power to help the businesses, as I've been doing with other members of this council, talking to the MBTA about moving a bus stop that is gonna be detrimental to the passengers, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4777.013s">in</a> the current state of placement of it, as well as for the businesses that are already going to be dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4784.277s">So</a> let's work on the stuff that we do have some input and control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4788.699s">The</a> DOT is overseeing this project, the Department of Transportation, and City Clerk Finn, at what point have they notified you about the public hearings coming up regarding posting it on the board and everything, or not yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4805.852s">Can</a> you turn him on?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4818.517s">Because</a> this Saturday, too, the bid went out for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4822.899s">The</a> bid went out this Saturday, two days ago.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4833.363s">And</a> the DOT does notify? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4835.765s">the</a> city though, where it is in the city, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4838.066s">Normally.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4839.547s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4840.208s">So,</a> um, so like I said, it just, uh, public meetings are meetings to get the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4845.651s">Public</a> hearings are more legality. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4848.293s">It's</a> a legality in certain instances. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4850.434s">You</a> need a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4851.395s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4852.195s">Clerk</a> Finn, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4853.776s">Public</a> hearing is a legality. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4856.238s">If</a> it, if it calls for you, if it calls for it, but they're not going to have public hearings unless it calls for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4861.581s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4862.157s">I</a> mean, there's a difference between public hearing and public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4864.138s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4865.579s">And</a> given the public hearings that may be, may be called for this might be because of the, um, the river underneath it and the river being affected by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4875.624s">And</a> that's a environmental public hearing, things of that nature.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4879.226s">Conservation</a> things. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4880.267s">But</a> typically there's not public hearings for doing a bridge over within a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4885.669s">If</a> it doesn't need. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4886.98s">because</a> it doesn't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4888.1s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4888.34s">I</a> just, I think that's important to, um, cause council Lungo-Koehn brought up a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4893.542s">But,</a> uh, if there is going to be public hearings, number one, they will hold them at an open, open place where people can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4902.105s">It</a> will be duly advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4903.846s">Uh,</a> and it also will be on the bulletin boards here at city hall, but unless it calls for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4908.597s">unless</a> it calls for it for a specific legality. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4911.838s">And</a> that's because maybe they're building so close to the water and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4916.199s">But</a> they just don't have public hearings, as you said, Mr. Clerk, for the sake of just having public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4923.862s">There's</a> a legal authority behind a public hearing and not so much a public meeting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5372.16s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5372.86s">And</a> the city administration, up to this point, this has been front and center. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5378.082s">This</a> afternoon, I believe, 101.30, there was a meeting with all the department heads, the Department of Transportation, the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5385.485s">And</a> so everyone was at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5388.206s">And</a> maybe they're working out specifics right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5392.707s">And</a> then they'll be bringing it forward at another level. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5396.488s">I</a> mean, at another meeting, I do not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5399.169s">But</a> there is ongoing dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5401.754s">And</a> as Councilor Knight said, there may be something we can do internally, whether it's a tax break. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5407.597s">But</a> most of that's not going to help the businesses either, because it's the building owners, the owners of the building, and then it's businesses that are paying rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5414.12s">But</a> there's stuff that we might be able to do, I'm thinking outside the box, in our community, like Councilor Knight said. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5419.602s">But</a> I just, when the word mitigation came up, I heard loud and clear what they said that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5425.105s">And</a> I just don't want to mislead businesses in the community that may think they're going to get a big check from the Department of Transportation, <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5431.959s">as</a> a result of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5434.16s">And</a> I just think, I think we have to be fair to them and not give them false hopes that they're going to get a golden bar at the end of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5444.003s">When</a> the state clearly said when they were here, they're not in the business of paying mitigation, but they will be willing to work with the city on maybe smaller projects in the immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5454.086s">If</a> they're parking on a park to park their trucks during the thing, they'll do the park over maybe or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5460.257s">similar</a> to the other projects that have taken place here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5465.241s">So,</a> I look forward to the future dialogue on this particular matter, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_ufxEwxM3_BY/2025-03-21_ufxEwxM3_BY.html">Medford City Council - May 26, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=52.701s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=53.561s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to take paper <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=60.148s">15-460</a> off the table and refer it to Committee of the Whole.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1101.409s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1101.89s">And,</a> um, I can certainly understand the frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1104.65s">My</a> home is right, uh, right underneath one of the paths and it seems like every weekend it's, uh, it's, it's coming from like the Winchester line right over, uh, the large Memorial hospital and, uh, into Logan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1115.813s">And,</a> uh, it is, it is, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1119.245s">It's</a> louder some days than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1120.587s">When</a> the bigger planes, the 747s, are either taking off or landing, it's a lot louder than some of the smaller A320s and some of them double-engine planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1131.395s">I</a> certainly agree with the resolve in looking in to see if there's some mitigation money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1135.459s">But</a> I also am very cognizant of the fact that Massport's first and most top priority is for the safety of the flights in and out of Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1144.546s">And</a> I'm sure they'll work with us any way they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1147.112s">But</a> this is a catch-22, this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1150.214s">For</a> the same reason people are paying a large amount of money for their homes here in our community, it's because of its proximity to Boston, to the airport, to the financial district, and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1162.72s">So</a> it's sort of a catch-22, shall we say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1165.122s">I</a> know Councilor Marks championed this issue many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1168.303s">He</a> was on the front page of the Boston Herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1170.325s">I</a> think it was the Herald, was it, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1173.286s">With</a> this very particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1175.165s">And</a> as I said in my conversations with Massport officials at the time, and that was about three or four years ago, I believe, more than that, as Councilor Mark says, they understand the frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1187.03s">And</a> if we do meet a threshold in certain areas of the community, then there is sometimes funding out there to do mitigation within the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1197.575s">I</a> know Winthrop receives a lot of money for the homes right in Winthrop, East Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1204.369s">But</a> like I said, unfortunately, this is, and I don't want to underestimate the severity of the noise, believe me, because I understand it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1217.437s">I</a> have a five-year-old, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that it is seven miles from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1227.883s">And</a> this is one thing that we have to expect, maybe not with the volume, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1231.892s">But</a> Boston, it's an international airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1235.513s">It's</a> not like Lawrence or Hyannis Airport, where you get flights every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1240.095s">We're</a> an international airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1241.515s">You</a> look at these planes, and they are low. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1243.256s">You</a> can read them, Lufthansa, Alitalia, and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1247.997s">So</a> I'm more concerned about the safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1251.098s">Like</a> I said, quite frankly, right after September 11th in the year 2001, there was an airline accident that happened right in New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1261.146s">and</a> it wasn't terrorist, it was mechanical failure or something of that nature, but it was, it landed under mechanical distress or whatever it was in a very populated area that was homes and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1277.256s">So</a> as I understand it, and the other thing is too, as the gentleman that comes up here weekly with his little tablet looking up webpages said so eloquently, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1288.598s">He</a> alluded to the fact of the winds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1292.041s">The</a> planes have to take off into the wind in order to get off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1297.064s">So</a> with that being said, a lot of the takeoffs are predicated upon the wind and the weather and all that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1305.971s">But</a> I certainly do agree with the studies that Councilor Marks brought up years ago and Councilor Lungo-Koehn again this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1312.456s">So</a> I do support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1314.297s">But</a> I just, as I stated, I'm not going to repeat the will, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1319.387s">And</a> I've heard that many people in the community this weekend at the coffee shop stated, because they read the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1324.83s">And</a> they were a little bit like, hey, when I moved to Medford from Salem, Mass., I knew I was paying $575,000 for my home to get closer to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1335.374s">And</a> this was one of the setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1338.576s">But</a> I certainly understand all the frustrations out there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2920.14s">The</a> library has a parking lot directly adjacent to the building, and I drive through that street quite frequently, and it butts it directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2929.767s">There's</a> always available spots in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2932.408s">Just</a> a point of information.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4074.47s">On</a> my first point is you had Eversource here as a result of Councilor Marks bringing the issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4083.753s">So</a> I applaud you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4086.835s">And</a> my second point of information is we did have representatives from the bridge here about a year ago, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4094.257s">Twice</a> in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4096.778s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4097.418s">And</a> at that point they stated that there won't be any mitigation to businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4104.728s">even</a> though this council did ask for it, they clearly stated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4108.449s">So,</a> I don't want businesses to think otherwise.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4227.882s">That</a> was the Department of Transportation representatives that were here meeting with this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4233.783s">Clearly</a> stated that the state does not pay mitigation on projects, but what they do do <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4240.88s">is</a> pay for any damages to any public or private entities that are damaged as a result. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4248.125s">That's</a> a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4249.406s">Mitigation</a> and physical damage.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4269.376s">We</a> can throw out the red herring, say an MWRA or any other agency he wants to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4274.399s">They</a> are not a state agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4277.08s">The</a> MWRA is a separate and distinct authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4280.402s">It's</a> an authority like Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4281.803s">It's</a> an authority like the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4283.844s">Their</a> rules, their laws are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4286.838s">The</a> Department of Transportation clearly stated this to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4290.0s">They</a> said it right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4290.86s">If</a> we have to go back, rewind the tape, maybe the council forgot what they said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4294.542s">I'm</a> not responsible for what he remembers, but I'm responsible for what happened here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4298.284s">And</a> that is clearly what was said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4299.884s">The</a> state does not pay mitigation on public projects.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4380.511s">Mr.</a> President, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4382.332s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4383.822s">to</a> say that there was no public meetings, it's fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4386.845s">It's</a> fiction, once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4388.246s">We</a> had a meeting here with the representatives from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4394.691s">One</a> of them's name was Donald Daly, and I don't remember the other gentleman's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4400.036s">What</a> was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4400.596s">Paul</a> King. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4401.297s">Paul</a> King. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4402.197s">They</a> were here at a 7 PM meeting of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4405.56s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4406.261s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4407.162s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4407.742s">So</a> to sit here and say that there hasn't been public
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4470.674s">Yes,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4472.055s">The</a> bus routes are going to go, the main bus route. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4476.177s">I</a> don't know if the councillor took the time to reach out to the correct officials as I did, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4480.653s">but</a> the bus route is going to be moved.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4499.122s">As</a> I stated, if the councillor doesn't want to go over and above, as I have over my 16 years of public service, reaching out to the particular people that can make, rather than yelling and screaming in hot air, can actually make the bus stop moved, they are moving it across the river over near the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4516.685s">And</a> hopefully it will be a permanent home even after the construction project with a nice greenery and maybe a bus shelter that Councilor Marks brought up before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4525.266s">So</a> I am doing some talks with the appropriate people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4529.114s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4530.035s">Number</a> two, I'm going to revert to a conversation I had with the councillor just a week ago, who was adamant about a former member of this council not bringing up the beer and wine.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4547.725s">It's</a> a pattern of your fictitious mind.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4554.971s">There's</a> nothing to do with the issue.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4560.076s">As</a> I started to say, Mr. President, earlier in his dissertation this evening, he said there was no public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4565.923s">In</a> fact, there were two public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4568.406s">And</a> the public meetings were in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4569.987s">This</a> is 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4572.47s">and</a> we had one here at the Medford City Council, not in 2013, I will get you the exact date, but it was right here, the gentlemen were here, it was the first meeting, the first item agenda, I believe, and it was a very, very good meeting, and they emphatically stated, I mean, if you wanna make up the rules as you go along, like you've done a long time.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4593.623s">As</a> I said, Mr. President, if he wants to let people believe there's mitigation available and set people up for failure, that's his responsibility.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4625.737s">There</a> was one today that he didn't go to.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4629.379s">But,</a> I mean...
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4671.984s">So</a> Mr. President, if I just can finish council, and I'll wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4675.765s">I</a> just, um, in council Lungo-Koehn is a hundred percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4679.706s">There</a> can be lawsuits and there probably will be lawsuits, but the fact of the matter is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on this particular matter is the department of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4687.487s">does</a> not pay mitigation for two businesses as a result of public works projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4695.472s">If</a> that was the case when they did the central artery and took down all the green space in there and did the Rose Kennedy Garden, the disruption, Mr. President, the disruption is lousy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4708.62s">And</a> I understand that completely, completely.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4732.645s">And</a> Mr. President, precisely, it was a public works mitigation that went to the city of Boston, not to the businesses that were directly affected in that area, like Faneuil Hall Marketplace and <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4747.461s">Well,</a> businesses property get taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4750.667s">But</a> like I said, the city, I'm sorry, the state, they said that at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4756.488s">This</a> isn't fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4757.548s">This</a> is factual, what the state said to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4760.569s">Now</a> if the law changes, I hope it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4763.209s">I</a> hope it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4764.309s">But</a> like I said, I think our biggest thing right now is doing everything in our power to help the businesses, as I've been doing with other members of this council, talking to the MBTA about moving a bus stop that is gonna be detrimental to the passengers, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4778.972s">in</a> the current state of placement of it, as well as for the businesses that are already going to be dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4786.215s">So</a> let's work on the stuff that we do have some input and control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4790.637s">The</a> DOT is overseeing this project, the Department of Transportation, and City Clerk Finn, at what point have they notified you about the public hearings coming up regarding posting it on the board and everything, or not yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4807.775s">Can</a> you turn him on?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4820.421s">Because</a> this Saturday, too, the bid went out for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4824.803s">The</a> bid went out this Saturday, two days ago.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4835.267s">And</a> the DOT does notify? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4837.792s">city</a> though where it is in the city correct normally okay so so like I said it just public meetings are meetings to get the information public hearings are more legality it's a legality in certain instances you need a public hearing correct me if I'm wrong clerk Finn is that correct public hearing is a legality if it calls for you if it calls for you but they're not gonna have public hearings unless it calls for it correct <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4864.03s">I</a> mean, there's a difference between public hearing and public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4865.992s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4867.453s">And</a> given the public hearings that may be called for this might be because of the river underneath it and the river being affected by it and that environmental public hearing, things of that nature.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4881.086s">Conservation</a> things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4882.127s">But</a> typically there's not public hearings for doing a bridge over within a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4887.472s">There</a> doesn't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4888.837s">because</a> it doesn't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4889.838s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4890.178s">I</a> just, I think that's important to, um, cause Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought up a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4895.381s">But,</a> uh, if there is going to be public hearings, number one, they will hold them at an open, open place where people can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4903.926s">It</a> will be duly advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4905.688s">Uh,</a> and it also will be on the bulletin boards here at city hall, but unless it calls for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4910.42s">unless</a> it calls for it for a specific legality, and that's because maybe they're building so close to the water and this and that, but they just don't have public hearings, as you said, Mr. Clerk, for the sake of just having public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4925.686s">There's</a> a legal authority behind a public hearing and not so much a public meeting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5369.499s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5370.279s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5372.18s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5373.561s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5374.261s">And</a> the city administration up to this point, this has been front and center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5379.458s">This</a> afternoon, I believe 1 or 1.30, there was a meeting with all the department heads, the Department of Transportation, the Chamber of Commerce, and so everyone was at the table, and maybe they're working out specifics right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5394.07s">and</a> then they'll be bringing it forward at another level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5397.832s">I</a> mean, at another meeting, I do not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5400.533s">But</a> there is ongoing dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5403.114s">And</a> as Councilor Knight said, there may be something we can do internally, whether it's a tax break. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5408.756s">But</a> most of that's not going to help the businesses either, because it's the building owners, the owners of the building, and then it's businesses that are paying rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5415.459s">But</a> there's stuff that we might be able to do, I'm thinking, outside the box in our community, like Councilor Knight said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5420.925s">But</a> I just, when the word mitigation came up, I heard loud and clear what they said that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5426.407s">And</a> I just don't want to mislead businesses in the community that may think they're going to get a big check from the Department of Transportation as a result of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5435.491s">And</a> I just think, I think we have to be fair to them and not give them false hopes that they're going to get a golden bar at the end of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5445.336s">When</a> the state clearly said when they were here, they're not in the business of paying mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5448.955s">But</a> they will be willing to work with the city on maybe smaller projects in the immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5455.378s">If</a> they're parking on a park to park their trucks during the thing, they'll do the park over maybe, or something like that, similar to the other projects that have taken place here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5466.543s">So</a> I look forward to the future dialogue on this particular matter, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_-Ufepi4QYj4/2025-03-21_-Ufepi4QYj4.html">Medford City Council - May 19, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3073.87s">Thank</a> you very much, and I want to thank you guys for coming here this evening for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3079.154s">And</a> I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3083.396s">I</a> realize that it's a few years away from actually putting the shovel into the ground, but the City Council wants to make sure that the citizens know what's going on and what the timeline is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3094.684s">So</a> I want to thank you, Councilor Marks, and also President Dello Russo for getting them here so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3102.033s">Within</a> seven days, we're here with a great presentation, so look forward to the additional communication over the coming years, and we'll see where we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3112.095s">And</a> I do agree with Councilor Knight that we should have a public hearing here in the City of Medford, even if it's on top of other ones that may be mandated throughout the region that the project is taking place in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3124.531s">even</a> if it's separate and distinct, at least for our residents, to get the opportunity to be heard on this critical matter.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3168.402s">While</a> we're on suspension, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3171.003s">I</a> move to take paper 15-486 for the young lady in the audience from the Mystic Valley that is here on a paper.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3259.092s">Mr.</a> President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3260.533s">Councilor,</a> please do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3262.094s">If</a> I may, real quick on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3265.696s">Mayor</a> McGlynn actually gave me a call this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3268.62s">This</a> is the paper that initiated here at the Medford City Council, and it's in direct correlation to the other stuff that Brooke and Penny are working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3280.185s">We</a> will be one of the first communities in the area to have a full-time Office of Substance Abuse and Treatment Opportunity slash education, I'd like to assume. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3293.951s">This</a> is a full-time position, I believe Boston, under the leadership of Mayor Walsh. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3298.287s">has</a> a full-time position as well, but the mayor clearly worked with the council on this, and it is coming to fruition, so I wanna move approval on this, and it's a department head position for this particular matter before us, so I'd like to move approval.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3351.888s">And</a> I'd like to motion to waive the three readings on this where it's.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3451.19s">$75,000</a> and $79,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3451.63s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3452.071s">CAF</a> 12, step one, and then right through step five, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3455.672s">Department</a> head level. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3456.713s">Department</a> head level. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3457.493s">Same</a> as the Director of Veterans Affairs.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3581.984s">Mr.</a> President, I will withdraw my motion, but just to be fair and full disclosure for the viewing public, this is only to put the title in the personnel ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3597.915s">Without</a> us doing our job and approving this, there is no job. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3602.057s">So,</a> I mean, the description may not even be done until <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3606.777s">after</a> the mayor knows that there's full support of this council, but I'll withdraw the three readings and see where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3611.62s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3621.827s">It</a> says it right at the last line. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3623.748s">The</a> money is funded in the fiscal year 2016 budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3631.093s">Yeah,</a> according to what the mayor says.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3635.796s">I</a> withdrew it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3690.33s">She</a> told me that she was too, personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3692.331s">She</a> told me she was the director of personnel.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3695.994s">And</a> her salary was commensurate with that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3699.116s">Also-</a> Just to let you know- Pardon me?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3969.743s">just</a> so we get an idea of... Every city job description that goes on has that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4344.688s">No,</a> we asked for the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4345.928s">I</a> specifically asked for it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4384.44s">Yes,</a> I would just like to go on record that although Councilor Pentlander's <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4391.198s">our</a> motion, our thoughts regarding the same exact increases across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4397.501s">It</a> sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4398.721s">I</a> think it's unrealistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4400.242s">We</a> have lunch mothers, we have paraprofessionals that are making $11,000 a year, and then we also have other unions that are across the board that are making $100,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4409.866s">So</a> to say that there should be parity amongst every single union, I just think that at this point, that's what the unions do, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4419.397s">the</a> other side of management sitting at the table, and that is called negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4423.7s">If</a> you just look at the past several years, too, there's been situations where the city has gotten back language from contracts that were put in in 1980s and 1970s, taken six days back, or personal days, and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4437.772s">And</a> when that happens, usually the other side gets something back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4445.704s">It's</a> called negotiation, so although I agree with Councilor Penter, it sounds great, I just think that it's a little bit unrealistic where you can't compare the maxed out city worker and the maxed out lunch mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4463.054s">There's</a> no equity when it comes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4464.835s">The</a> 3% raise on $11,000 is not paying the gas bill increase each month. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4472.095s">But</a> with that being said, I'd like to waive the three readings on this paper, too.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4584.692s">Just</a> to follow up with that, I think Councilor Penta just proved the point that I was trying to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4590.335s">If</a> you have a bargaining unit that hasn't got raises in eight years, like the lunch mothers, then the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4598.407s">raises</a> should be commensurate with the length of time that surpassed since the last raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4605.95s">So</a> I want to thank the councilor because I think we agree that my way is better on this particular matter.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7627.501s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7629.582s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7630.102s">Um,</a> you know, with the parking complaints, um, and businesses claiming that, um, there's not enough spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7636.565s">I</a> mean, this is probably an appropriate time to start looking at the garage again in Medford square. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7642.387s">Um,</a> the money is set aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7644.028s">State</a> representative has it in the bond bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7647.129s">And,</a> um, I think that this is the appropriate time to actually start talking about it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7652.211s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7653.994s">There</a> is a need for longer-term business parking within the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7659.296s">So,</a> I think the administration should take it under consideration, at least at this point, because the business owners that are complaining about not having spots, if there are additional spots that are allocated for long-term parking, and as I said in the past, the administration, it was another one of those issues that they just never brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7679.002s">They</a> talked about it, and this and that, and the council talked about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7682.307s">But</a> there has not been a proposal for the garage that's been before us for a vote for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7688.25s">And</a> as I said, State Rep Donato has worked tirelessly to get funding in the transportation bond bill for that specific purpose, as well as other money that was set aside by, I believe, the previous administration.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7720.365s">I</a> did not say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7721.426s">All</a> I said was in the transportation bond bill, there's $3 million set aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7725.829s">$8</a> million, Councilor Caraviello said. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7730.432s">I'm</a> not exactly sure on the figure, but the bottom line is I think as one member of this council, there is a need for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7741.014s">And</a> we haven't had the opportunity to take a formal vote, whether we're for or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7745.796s">And</a> as I said, I'm urging the administration to bring it forward and finally give the people of Medford Square, the neighbors, the business owners, an opportunity to come down here and be heard, as people were given the opportunity to come down in the Brooks Estates, the new science labs, and the list goes on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7763.802s">Jot</a> the Course, which was brought forward by the McGlynn administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7768.183s">This</a> was part of it originally, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7770.165s">And</a> it just never came to a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7771.565s">So</a> I think that we owe it at least to the business owners to take a long, serious look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7778.047s">And</a> unfortunately, the people out there, the farmer garage was built under the old farmer government, where it was the city council and the city managers back in, I want to say the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7788.49s">And</a> I'm sure Mayor McGlynn still has the plaque from the garage when it fell down with the names on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7795.632s">But</a> with that being said, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7799.842s">I</a> think it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7801.744s">And</a> I, as one member of this council do support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7803.826s">And</a> I would hope that it at least entertain it and give the people the opportunity to be heard.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7858.718s">Madam</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7860.921s">If</a> I may too, I'd just like to go on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7864.749s">I</a> know there is some frustration by some of the members of the Ticket Enforcement Unit, but there are several members of working for that company that are good, long-standing Medford families, Medford residents, and I think they're doing a fine and admirable job. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7882.59s">You</a> call that office, we all know who works up in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7886.912s">A</a> Medford gal and very friendly, two Medford gals, I didn't know the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7891.934s">And</a> then one of the enforcement officers is a Medford young man that grew up here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7899.857s">So</a> the ones that at least live in this community are taking pride in their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7904.298s">And</a> I just want the record to reflect that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7975.434s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7976.515s">The</a> one thing that's been unanimous amongst the people that I talk to is they all look forward to Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7983.497s">The</a> day of rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7984.777s">I</a> think, on a serious note though, we brought it up a few weeks ago, the holiday has to be straightened out and it has to be a lot of public output because <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7995.088s">There</a> were people on Patriots Day, and you weren't here for the meeting, but people on Patriots Day were getting tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7998.93s">Now,</a> I know the company did write by it, but it has to be unison. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8004.893s">Is</a> it the federal calendar, or is it the state calendar? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8007.814s">I</a> think it should be the state calendar, because how can you justify having City Hall closed and the schools closed, but still be able to get a ticket? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8015.678s">And</a> rubbish delivery doesn't get picked up, like Councilor Pender said. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8018.56s">It</a> should be all holidays on both schedules.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8033.372s">Bunker</a> Hill Day, though, City Hall is closed, so it should be closed.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8037.676s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8038.757s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8246.712s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8247.573s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8249.67s">I</a> agree with a lot of the sentiments of Councilor Caraviello, but I also know there are a lot of two and three families that have significant amount of parking right on their own property. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8260.859s">And</a> this is a new way of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8264.902s">People</a> don't want the big homes anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8266.403s">They</a> want to buy a smaller condominium. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8269.786s">So</a> I just think the Board of Appeals has to look at each individual cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8273.489s">Similar</a> to a few years ago when the Meadow Glen Mall sign came up, and I'm not far of those big signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8278.234s">But</a> in certain areas, I think they're actually good and they bring business. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8282.497s">But</a> to tell someone that there's a moratorium in place, and if they have 7,500 square feet and they can fit the appropriate parking and-.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8304.57s">But</a> a lot of times the conversions, I think the conversions and the board of appeals are two separate things. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8310.292s">Um,</a> a lot of times you don't even have to go to the board of appeals to convert to a, if you already own a two family, it's more or less just going to the building department and condo eyes in it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8334.002s">But</a> also, there are some buildings throughout our community that are currently zoned for more than the units that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8343.425s">They</a> may have a zoning for a six-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8345.945s">At</a> the end of Irving Street, at the corner of Irving and Placestead, you've got six or seven units in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8351.527s">Now,</a> is it appropriate? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8353.707s">But</a> it's conforming use. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8355.328s">It's</a> a conforming use. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8356.837s">And</a> I agree with you that we have to actually take a long, hard look at it, but I think we have to leave it in the Board of Appeals hands, and they have to look at it individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8366.723s">Because</a> there are certain lots and properties within the community that take a blighted area, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8375.949s">You'd</a> rather have maybe a three or four family than the one family that's run as a rental place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8386.547s">It's,</a> I think, I just think the Board of Appeals right now is in a total, it's a good, it's a good, not it's a good, it's the only avenue where they can go and look at it realistically, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8401.656s">They</a> are very, I'd say that they deny more than they approve developments and conversions in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8411.061s">I</a> mean, I'd like to know the statistics on it, too, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8414.21s">How</a> many of these properties have actually made it to the Board of Appeals and were approved?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8419.593s">I</a> mean, that's something that I'd like to know.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9226.888s">That</a> evening, I believe the company was, was it DTZ? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9230.03s">We</a> were well aware that it was a contracted company. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9232.752s">They</a> got up here and represented themselves as a contracted company and members of SEIU, Service Employees International United. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9241.079s">No,</a> I understand they're not employees at Tufts Universities, but it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9244.541s">We</a> would try to, we would try to, no it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9246.723s">So</a> what, if they were Tufts University employees, we don't want them getting laid off, but because they have to work, because they happen to work for an outside entity, we, okay, let them go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9253.764s">I</a> mean, I don't see any difference in that at all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9277.055s">Once</a> again, once again, the more Councilor Penta talks, he backs up what I'm trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9282.62s">It's</a> twice this evening you've done what I've tried to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9285.602s">Earlier</a> in the evening, you contradicted me, and then in the end, you end up agreeing with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9292.909s">So</a> it's kind of, I find it kind of comical. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9295.571s">But</a> with that being said, Madam President, with this particular issue, I would like to, the motion before us is to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9304.223s">So</a> there's been plenty of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9305.884s">I</a> don't know if the council is going to bring forward a motion other than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9309.427s">But</a> to go one step further, I know firsthand from going to the Board of Appeals over the years and following the rulings and stuff, and I'm sure you know this as well as a congratulations being one of the top female attorneys in the area, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9327.919s">Vice</a> President Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9329.823s">But</a> with that being said, the Board of Appeals, I'd like to find out how many of these were approved over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9337.967s">I</a> would say it's less than 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9339.607s">So</a> for us to sit here and say it's changing the fabric of our entire community, matter of fact, we had someone, and I'm not going to use the name, but was going for one of these who worked for the United States Senator's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9351.673s">At</a> the time, it was a congressman's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9353.634s">And</a> it was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9355.155s">And</a> it was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9357.565s">So</a> this is not a major problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9359.888s">Now,</a> this particular one, I don't know where 198 and 202 Harvard Street is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9363.271s">I'm</a> not going to get into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9364.172s">I'm</a> not going to discuss it prior to going down and maybe looking at the property and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9369.358s">But</a> with that being said, the Board of Appeals, I think it's incumbent upon us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9373.424s">Rather</a> than to sit here and say it's changing the fact the the character of all our neighborhoods I think we have to ask the question How many of these were approved over say the last 10 years and if it's more than a dozen, I will be shocked shocked in a city of our size I'm pretty sure it's less than a dozen because they are very very strict and anyone that knows anything about the Board of Appeals There's only a few criteria <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9399.058s">that</a> they can actually approve something. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9401.48s">One</a> is when it's created a hardship, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9404.762s">And</a> what's the other one, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9406.343s">Do</a> you know off the top of your head? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9407.744s">It's</a> if there's a financial hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9411.567s">That's</a> the main one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9416.167s">I</a> just think we spent 45 minutes on an issue that Councilor Caraviello is probably right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9422.312s">I</a> know he does his due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9423.594s">He</a> drives around more than any councillors that sit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9427.137s">And</a> he checks out all the properties that he brings up and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9430.499s">So</a> as I said, I'd like to reserve my judgment on that particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9435.804s">But</a> with that being said, I'd like to make a motion, if you don't mind, on how many of these were actually approved in the last 10 fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9444.008s">And</a> then we can actually tell if there's a major problem in the community, and we should be putting in some sort of zoning ordinance or zoning law. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9452.695s">But</a> knowing that board, I will be shocked, like I said, if it's more than a dozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9456.938s">Because</a> I get more phone calls of the projects that get denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9461.421s">And</a> sometimes they're legitimate reasons, but just the hardship or whatever criteria that needs to be met is not met. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9468.586s">And</a> I know Attorney Arena, he is so tight when it comes to ethical standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9475.362s">It's</a> amazing, so.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9692.834s">Obviously,</a> about a month or two ago, we had a detective from the Medford Police Department here, and to say a crack house can pop up, we have these problems in every single neighborhood in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9707.202s">Every</a> single neighborhood in this city, we have problems when it comes to people selling drugs out of a certain house. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9712.865s">So</a> to say it's as a result of these or that, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9718.328s">what's</a> the word, not when they condoize it, when it goes from a two to three, conversion, exactly, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9724.849s">To</a> say that it's as a result of conversion, Forest Street may have been one particular case, but we've had a drug bust on Wareham Street, $40,000, a gun, heroin, and everything else within the last seven days. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9739.192s">We</a> have other drug busts within the last three or four months up in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9744.033s">The</a> detective that was here a few weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9746.244s">talked</a> about how each and every councillor, and he knows where all of us live, within walking distance of all of our own houses, there's been drug arrests from residents.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9773.053s">Well,</a> I'll tell you one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9774.51s">If</a> I had a situation near my house where my family's growing up and it is a crack house and there was a potential for development to come in and make it maybe a two-family house or something else, I would go to the Board of Appeals and I would support the conversion with the hopes of having the crack house vacated. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9794.161s">So</a> in some cases, this is actually good. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9798.363s">Look</a> at Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9799.584s">We've</a> been talking about Boynton Road, number 56 Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9802.812s">If</a> there was a conversion that could take place that would be good in that neighborhood, I'm sure Mr. Crowley would be here and his neighbors to speak on behalf of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9812.276s">But</a> there is particular cases where you're better off taking a conversion than dealing with some of the nonsense that goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9818.479s">I</a> know in Councilor Caraviello's neighborhood, there's a house that there's overdoses in weekly, weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9824.322s">People</a> going in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9825.342s">I</a> mean, Councilor Caraviello, what was it, two deaths or one death there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9829.564s">Two</a> deaths. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9830.94s">I'm</a> sure the neighbors would want that to be converted if someone came in and wanted to clean up the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9837.502s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9839.303s">So</a> there is cases that the Board of Appeals should take into consideration, and they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9848.665s">So</a> I'd like to get that number, though, because I think we're all going to be surprised by the small, small amount of approvals for conversions from a single family or a two family or a three family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9860.232s">So</a> any conversion higher, what's the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9862.813s">We</a> got to ask the actual question rather than get it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9864.913s">We</a> didn't understand the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9866.693s">Any</a> conversion that added a different, an additional unit, a single to a, a single to a two, a two to a three, a three to a four. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9877.256s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10140.012s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10143.034s">I</a> think that that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10144.913s">And</a> we have a code enforcement department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10146.374s">A</a> lot of times, most of the complaints come from actual neighbors that will see additional vehicles and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10152.938s">Unfortunately,</a> as we all know, as city councilors, we don't find out all the time about these illegal units until it goes to sell or they're doing a home inspection or doing the appraisal for the taxes, which we're going through right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10171.115s">City</a> actually sends someone in the house and they're looking for stoves in the basement and stuff in the basement that would indicate that it's... But I'd say 90% of them, and we've heard this from our building department, comes from neighbors' complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10184.766s">So</a> they do take them very serious when it does come up, but if they don't know, they can't do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10190.33s">Thank</a> you, ma'am.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_E2oeLkYbA5Q/2025-03-21_E2oeLkYbA5Q.html">Medford City Council - May 12, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=931.628s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=932.628s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=934.282s">Thank</a> you, and I want to commend Councilor Marks for bringing this up this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=938.566s">This</a> is certainly going to have a major impact on our community, as is the Credit Bridge, which will be going on roughly around the same time, I assume. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=948.654s">But</a> that project is so convoluted as far as timelines and timeframes, I'm just assuming at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=956.401s">With</a> that being said, I like Councilor Marks, all his recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=961.725s">Unfortunately,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=963.069s">According</a> to the Councilor, there's no mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=966.051s">In</a> the past, Algonquin Gas paid mitigation, but I'm not sure of the specifics of that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=972.214s">But</a> if that's something we can look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=975.696s">But</a> I want to thank the Councilor for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=977.917s">On</a> a side note, if the Councilor doesn't mind, or I can make it a separate paper, can we ask for the MBTA to come in at this point with another <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=991.146s">idea</a> slash proposal for moving the bus stop across from Medford Auto School down here in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=998.188s">We</a> need to get that done prior to the construction commencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1002.569s">It's</a> not going to be.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1044.463s">I</a> think it's Committee of the Whole for the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1046.785s">Our</a> Committee of the Whole for the Craddock Bridge, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1049.167s">Either</a> way, it's not going to be fair to the consumers and the people that utilize public transportation to find out two days before a shovel's on the ground that now they have to go to place X or Y or Z to catch transportation to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1066.34s">So</a> if we could call that Committee of the Whole in a fairly reasonable time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1070.564s">Last</a> but not least, if we could also send to the Committee of the Whole <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1074.347s">We</a> got a paper this evening, and if we want to bring this up at a different agenda item, I would put something on, but if we can, if the Councilor sees it as fit to just refer the paper from Cassandra Koudelidis, telling us that at roughly $4 million to resurface and to mill and pave Boston Ave, Forest Street, High Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, the part that the city owns, as well as Riverside Avenue, Salem Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1104.507s">I,</a> as one member of this council, we have a lot of money in reserves right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1108.711s">We</a> also have a great bond rating due to the good fiscal management that's been going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1114.715s">I</a> think these roads need to be resurfaced once and for all, and I think that's a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1119.138s">I</a> know as one member of the council, I would support a bond initiative or using some of the reserves for the $4 million to do a complete infrastructure improval <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1132.505s">improvement</a> rather on these streets and these are main thoroughfares and it actually equates to what did she say as far as mileage? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1141.652s">58,000</a> linear feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1144.194s">So</a> it's 265,000 square feet of paving and milling that would take place and it's something that I think we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1153.041s">Now</a> the good question would be to ask the engineer is this something that we should wait to do until after the project that Councilor Marks is referring to? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1160.762s">two</a> years down the road, or is it, because I'm not an engineer, I don't know, they talked about five feet underground and stuff, but is it five feet, I don't know, so would it make sense to do a major initiative like this after this project, or wait until? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1175.891s">Why</a> don't we talk to the city engineer, and then call the appropriate meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1180.174s">Do</a> you mind if that's a B paper, Councilor, or do you want me to put it on? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1182.976s">It's</a> all part of the main paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1186.738s">And</a> thank you again to Councilor Marks for bringing this important item up.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2280.354s">Councilor</a> Camuto. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2282.275s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2284.395s">Just</a> a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2285.536s">Now,</a> are you a volunteer at Mass Resistance, or are you a paid consultant or an employee?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2300.262s">And</a> Mass Resistance, I've known about it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2306.292s">exactly</a> what type of things do you guys lobby behind, and it's mostly family issues, is that correct?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2331.568s">Now,</a> the Parents' Rights Coalition, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2335.568s">Was</a> it under them, I think it was under that name, that you were strong opposition to the same-sex marriage and put up on Beacon Hill and it was brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2345.796s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2346.397s">Was</a> that that organization or the new one?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2356.326s">No,</a> mass resistance is very much <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2360.259s">behind</a> in opposition to same-sex marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2364.423s">I</a> believe as recent as within the last few weeks with the court case up in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2368.686s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2371.008s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2371.408s">So,</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2374.031s">I</a> just wanted to get a better understanding on what we're looking at supporting this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2379.955s">And</a> quite honestly, I don't know much about the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2385.86s">And</a> as Councilor Knight alluded to a few weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2388.91s">The</a> democratic process, as you know, it can be a bill that's submitted one way, and by the end, by the time it hits the governor's desk, it's totally different. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2396.933s">And</a> that's the democratic and legislative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2399.614s">So,</a> at this point, I will not be supporting this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2403.275s">Just</a> as a point of... And thank you very much for... Oh, yeah.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2412.018s">I</a> understand that, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that the legislative process, you can start out with the text and the verbiage of one bill being <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2419.26s">A,</a> B, C, D, and then by the end of it, it's totally extrapolated, things added, things taken out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2424.344s">And</a> I understand, and I have my own personal feelings about the surveys in the public schools, but I'm certainly not going to take a vote based upon my own personal feelings, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2436.793s">And</a> number two, I just, I don't know where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2441.137s">I</a> would feel better seeing how it comes out of committee, if it comes out of committee, and then saying whether we support it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2448.917s">I</a> know in the past, some of the initiatives that mass resistance has been adamantly against the same sex marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2455.241s">I'm</a> on the other side of the issue on that particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2458.544s">And</a> at this point, I just don't have enough information to be quite frank with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2462.666s">So</a> I don't feel comfortable supporting something early on as this in the legislative process, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2528.062s">And,</a> uh, I appreciate the council is, um, um, opinions, but as I stated, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2535.239s">Just</a> in our own homeroom petitions, by the time things get to the governor's desk, it's changed tremendously. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2541.624s">We've</a> dealt with that, as Councilor Penta said, right here, with stuff that was initiated in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2546.847s">And</a> it was a lot of changes by the time it left the city clerk's office with the mayor and the council signatures on it, all the way to the time it got back to Governor Deval Patrick's desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2555.714s">And</a> for that reason, I'm not supporting this this evening.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3021.612s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3023.792s">Um,</a> just for the gentlemen, um, I believe, I don't know if it was you or one of my council colleagues said that Medford did notify the parents, but it was vague.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3037.116s">So</a> Medford is following the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3038.656s">If,</a> if that's the case, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3040.556s">You're</a> getting told secondhand. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3041.617s">I'm</a> getting told third hand.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3347.788s">Just</a> one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3350.889s">Just</a> one more question for the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3352.91s">I</a> believe, was this the same group that I believe you were successful <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3358.887s">in</a> the early 2000s, blocking Governor Cellucci's ambassadorship.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3368.553s">Well,</a> no, no, but it was until he agreed to no longer do anything that would protect the rights of homosexual activity in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3377.698s">I</a> remember a landmark, something to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3381.5s">There</a> was a human foreign relations subcommittee at the time, and I believe it was <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3387.319s">The</a> group might be the national group.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3394.643s">Senator</a> Jesse Helms at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3395.963s">That's</a> who it was.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4090.998s">Sorry,</a> president council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4092.558s">Um,</a> it may be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4095.16s">It</a> may not be appropriate to bring it up at this point, but we received the budget this evening with a $5 million increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4101.608s">$5</a> million increase from the previous year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4105.17s">Obviously,</a> Tamar said that the additional money needed for the accreditation is not included in that line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4112.814s">But</a> more importantly, the city council has been asking for months now for the transfers of all the transfers of municipal funds in to and from accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4124.801s">And</a> we have not received that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4127.085s">How</a> do we look at the budget realistically if we don't know how much money was transferred to and from line items that they're being presented to us in the next month and a half? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4137.267s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4139.348s">And</a> then at the end of the year, we're going to get another slew of transfers to balance this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4144.969s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4147.029s">I'm</a> surprised we haven't had them already. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4148.75s">We</a> got a paper tonight from Ann Baker answering us the projected revenues <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4155.661s">And</a> that was the B paper to my original transfer paper request. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4160.824s">So</a> they answered the B paper because they wanted to, but the transfer paper that was the original paper that was brought up that that amendment was put on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4170.368s">We</a> have a beautiful report tonight on the amendment, but the amendment doesn't tell us a picture on how much money is being transferred to and from accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4180.513s">This</a> is simple for the regular person viewing at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4184.362s">If</a> you have a checking account, a savings account, and another checking account, and you transfer the money in between accounts by doing online banking, unless you actually look where the money came from, where it's going, and for what intent it's spended for, you're not going to know the actual balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4205.535s">And</a> it's the budget we got tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4208.097s">Without</a> the transfers, take the fiscal year budget we're in and throw it out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4212.239s">Throw</a> it out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4214.312s">We</a> know what's been encumbered, what's projected to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4217.556s">But</a> other than that, and we know there are accounts that are in the arrears right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4223.282s">I</a> don't know exactly which ones, but I'm assuming it's overtime accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4227.006s">I'm</a> assuming it's other accounts out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4229.629s">And</a> unless we have a full accounting of all the transfers, it's unrealistic budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4237.218s">And</a> as I talked about a few weeks ago, we have $6 million, $6 million plus in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4243.163s">It's</a> certified because we didn't expend that money that was raised in previous fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4252.87s">And</a> the DOR certified us to go ahead and put it in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4259.294s">So</a> that $6 million that was appropriated on the backs of the taxpayers for several years, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4266.611s">to</a> get a savings, to put the city in a financially good spot for debt consolidation and other wonderful things that have happened over the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4278.117s">But</a> the transfer paper is a very, very important piece of my moving forward in either supporting or not supporting a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4288.09s">You</a> know, and this budget's going to be very, very interesting in particular, too, because with a new administration, we don't know, this is where we can craft where we think the city should be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4299.6s">OCD,</a> I think, should be boosted up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4303.063s">We</a> have to give the new administration the tools to do their vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4310.429s">They</a> may say that certain officers don't need X amount of people, and other areas need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4316.783s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4317.604s">We</a> don't know who's going to be in that corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4319.825s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, Mr. President, I think we need to have those transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4325.068s">I</a> think the transfers tell us exactly how much money of — and I want to say this the correct way — how much money that was put aside for a specific purpose at the end of June last year was actually spent on that specific purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4344.799s">And</a> just for the viewing public, too, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4346.969s">The</a> city council has to make transfers, and according to Massachusetts finance law, the only time the city council has to make the transfers, if it's from one account that's totally different from another account, if it's from the police to the fire, or from information technology to the city clerk, interdepartmental transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4369.515s">We</a> don't have any control or any say, and nor does the administration need any vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4376.583s">regarding</a> transfers internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4378.304s">So</a> they could put money in an account that's called water cooler for $5,000 say, and they can take that out and use it for something else without the city council needing to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4388.311s">So</a> I hopefully that gives a good picture to people out there on how the budget actually works, where the certified free cash that we all talk about comes from, and more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4400.41s">the</a> budget that we pass, if it indeed is being spent in the areas where we put our stamp of approval on by a majority vote of the duly elected members of the Medford City Council year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4412.821s">So</a> I would say, Mr. President, that I think you have to send the message to the city administration that without that paper, don't even bother showing up to a budget hearing, honestly, because we've been asking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4424.711s">And</a> to get the B paper answered, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4427.082s">and</a> not the original paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4428.702s">It's,</a> it's kind of humorous.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4486.361s">And</a> now, Mr. President, one last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4489.962s">I</a> know it comes up during budget hearing, but Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4491.783s">Siegel</a> this evening as well referenced it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4494.945s">If</a> we also could see where the status is, if any, of the waiver going forward as well, because we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4503.189s">I</a> know in the past years we've had one after the waiver, but is that the intention this year to go after the waiver again? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4509.912s">But</a> I think that's part of the question that should be answered.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5396.608s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5398.328s">And</a> I believe, first of all, this was initiated by Councilor Marks about four or five years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5406.61s">Four</a> years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5408.25s">And</a> it was on the end of the agenda ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5411.07s">And</a> just till recently, I believe we received the request for the $30,000 for the feasibility study from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5419.012s">With</a> that being said, I think we really got to get a good understanding, too, on how the mausoleums actually work. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5427.105s">Councilor</a> Penta brought up a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5429.105s">Where</a> exactly is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5431.266s">The</a> second piece of the puzzle is, I'm not quite sure if public cemeteries are in the business normally of managing a mausoleum. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5442.228s">I</a> know a lot of the private cemeteries, it seems, has them more than, is that fair to say, Councilor, based upon your professional? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5448.93s">Okay,</a> so that is true, that it's the private <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5453.838s">cemeteries</a> that seem to have Management of these a lot more than the other thing is to I want to get an idea how much it's gonna cost for a Medford family Some of the numbers that you hear are pretty significant For this so I just think we should have a meeting and I agree with councillor Penta just to find out Where we're going with this as a whole as councillor night did say though the and I agree with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5480.449s">This</a> is strictly a <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5482.312s">under</a> the jurisdiction of the Cemetery Board of Trustees. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5486.254s">Unless</a> they're looking for bonding through the City Council, that is where our official action would be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5493.677s">But</a> I'm glad we're talking about it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6792.61s">Um,</a> we're still waiting on an opinion from the city solicitor that we asked for probably several months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6798.852s">This</a> whole thing could be moot if the Medford city council injects, um, a recension of the original vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6806.211s">that</a> was taken way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6809.152s">We</a> asked for a ruling, whether it was a new contract or an extension of the contract, or if it was by home rule petition, or if it was by a separate law. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6822.394s">And</a> I believe we're still waiting for that opinion from the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6825.655s">He's</a> been very busy providing us other opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6828.315s">But</a> that one, I think, should be put to the front of the list, where this is something that's ongoing right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6856.492s">So</a> we're calling the role on the, well, did the chair rule that this is contradictory to the vote last week? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6864.354s">You</a> did say that you agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6868.618s">I'm</a> just asking a question of the chair, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6875.139s">It's</a> not reaffirming. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6876.139s">It's</a> changing.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10035.002s">No,</a> I'm talking about Paul Camuso's vision, not the mayor or anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10038.204s">This</a> is Paul Camuso's vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10041.475s">Think</a> about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10043.195s">We</a> have money that's set aside right now in a transportation bond bill for the garage in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10048.397s">We</a> could put some sort of parking down there that could abut the train station, where it currently exists on the other side of the tracks, so the train doesn't even have to stop anymore and basically cause the confusion that it does, and it stops for 20 minutes when it's an inbound train. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10063.68s">There's</a> stuff to be done down there, potentially, by using some of these monies and capital that's put aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10070.278s">You</a> know, but unless you get engaged in the conversation and talk about bringing a real solution to the table, we're just going to keep having conversations about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10080.284s">But</a> this is a real good opportunity for a public-private partnership to get together for the city to purchase the land in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10088.989s">I'm</a> sorry, the buildings that's directly around the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10097.294s">You</a> clean up the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10099.134s">And</a> then you turn around and you put it up for bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10102.916s">And</a> here's the other thing, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10106.438s">If</a> we're doing that, a developer can come in and put a garage underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10110.681s">A</a> garage underground in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10112.322s">Add</a> another 200 spots to West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10116.405s">This</a> is all stuff that should be talked about.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10120.847s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10121.508s">I</a> mean, you look at that specific land, it's perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10124.409s">It's</a> like a triangle. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10125.769s">It's</a> got the building where Snappy Patty's is, you have the liquor store and the hair salon, and then you have the building out behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10132.213s">You've</a> got a good acre, acre and a half of land there if you put it all together with very, very, very good potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10138.777s">Right</a> now, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10140.698s">It's</a> a sick area that is going to cost us millions of dollars to clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10144.18s">Let's</a> try to come up with something to clean it up <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10147.756s">And</a> I'm sure the business owners too, and we certainly can't speak to them, file them, because this is just quick thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10155.912s">But</a> the liquor store, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10161.484s">They</a> get a brand new site to operate his current business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10163.925s">You're</a> going to have more environmentally friendly coolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10166.306s">You're</a> going to have more environmentally friendly business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10169.787s">You're</a> going to have more environmentally friendly cooling systems, heating and HVAC air conditioners, and just the regular heating. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10178.01s">I</a> mean, monthly expenses will go down with a new development there for the current landowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10184.773s">But</a> this is where you have to have a vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10189.142s">Like</a> I said, Locust Street, I think we're missing the boat on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10193.404s">And</a> that's why I didn't support another auto body shop down there a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10199.067s">Because</a> Locust Street is a premier spot to get a good development like a Stations Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10204.73s">No</a> one ever thought Stations Landing would be as beautiful as it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10209.232s">Nobody.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10209.892s">What</a> was Stations Landing previously known for? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10212.314s">Going</a> down to get your Christmas trees, going to Bickford's, and then going to Strawberries to get a new record of tape when it came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10217.356s">That</a> was about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10219.318s">What</a> was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10219.878s">Richard's</a> car. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10221.199s">Richard's</a> car hop. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10221.96s">You're</a> a little bit older. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10223.441s">Um,</a> but with that being said, uh, that, that, that had some vision and there's no reason why some other of these other areas in our community that are blighted somewhat or environmentally sick can't be done in the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10235.51s">Look</a> at the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10236.851s">The</a> DPW yard looks beautiful now.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_V22AEle-x6o/2025-03-21_V22AEle-x6o.html">Medford City Council - April 28, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1794.234s">And</a> the reason I ask that is because I think it's a very good project. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1798.737s">And</a> I was under the impression that it was going to be this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1802.901s">But</a> as we approach May, construction-wise, I just wasn't sure that we could get it done.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1846.634s">And</a> I'd like to recognize Council President for giving me the leeway to ask that question, because I know some people were asking, and as we got later in the year, didn't know if it was actually feasible to get it done by the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1856.477s">So,</a> yes, thank you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3399.355s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3400.275s">So</a> a request for roll call on the motion for approval and sever the question of the 15 grand. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3407.32s">The</a> sever has to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3409.681s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3411.883s">I</a> just, I'm for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3412.924s">And</a> if I can state, I have the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3416.226s">This</a> is for the Alfonso Caro Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3418.908s">It's</a> the common area of that development, and it's where most of the things take place down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3425.772s">It's</a> where election day is held. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3429.314s">So</a> this is definitely a common area, and this is where you're going to get the best impact for the best dollar, and I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3439.16s">The</a> improvements that were made over the last few years were significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3441.601s">There</a> were squirrels and raccoons living in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3444.066s">prior</a> to the last improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3446.387s">So</a> I certainly do support this as a quality of life issue, and it's coming from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3452.689s">So</a> rather than get rid of it, I'd rather see it funded here than in Milwaukee or Nevada or somewhere else that we'll be putting in for funds as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3523.303s">Present</a> a question please to the council, and yes, vote is one 15,000 stated or?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3562.81s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3563.691s">The</a> only other way, I see Councilor Pinter's point, but the only other way would be taking a yay or nay vote on the entire paper as approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3571.419s">And</a> from listening to the council, I don't think that the votes are there to take the $15,000 away from the Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3580.147s">So</a> in essence, if we vote yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3583.847s">as</a> it, as it's on our agenda, it's approval for the whole paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3587.27s">That's</a> so I was doing the sever out of respect for you, Councilor, so that we could take a separate vote on that piece.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3761.014s">Point</a> of information Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3762.734s">Um,</a> in all due respect to Councilor Penta, that may be the druthers of one councilor, but there may be other councilors here that are in, in, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3772.715s">favor</a> of it as presented so that the $50,000 that's non-encumbered right now for a specific purpose can be utilized for the senior citizens within a development and not necessarily that development. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3784.984s">If</a> we fund this money, some of the federal money can be used at other developments in the city.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3805.16s">And</a> if they do get money, and it's more than anticipated, they can do an additional project down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3810.081s">And</a> quite honestly, Walkland Court's a lovely community, but it's probably the building that needs the most upgrades out of them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3818.823s">And</a> that's from walking and traversing in all of them over quite a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3823.306s">So</a> I understand where the council is coming from, but to have the OCD director do that, when it may not be the druthers of the entire council, if he wants to do something like that, then let's take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3834.203s">That's</a> basically all I'm saying.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3845.034s">If</a> the members of the council, once again, support asking that question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3851.28s">Because</a> I know that over the years, that has been one development that has <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3856.925s">for</a> lack of a better word, not receive some of the other upgrades that other developments have. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3861.488s">You</a> go down here to 121 Riverside Avenue, they spent a lot of money in the lobby over the years, they spent a lot of money in the grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3870.773s">Now</a> I understand some of them are federal and some of them are state buildings, but the one you hear the most complaints about is Walkland Court.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3903.975s">That's</a> a long-term plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3906.717s">And</a> very well possibly in the future, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3909.919s">It</a> could be something where, with the Green Line coming into that particular area, that there may be other housing options where they can build a new development somewhere else within our community or in a neighboring community that's state-funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3924.598s">than</a> possibly a whole new development. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3926.879s">I</a> mean, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3927.699s">That's</a> going to be a hot area.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3932.24s">Precisely.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3937.681s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3938.161s">And</a> that's what's keeping the units affordable.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3949.664s">The</a> president administration is another six months.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3969.082s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3970.103s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3971.804s">I'd</a> like to ask the council, where the post office in South Medford is. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3974.367s">I'm</a> not familiar.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3977.126s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3977.366s">The</a> hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3977.806s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3978.026s">I</a> was thinking more South Medford square.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5986.419s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5986.919s">And,</a> um, you know, I, I certainly support this this evening, but, um, I think this council has been very supportive of the arts, uh, just within the last few years, the line item that was offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5999.683s">for</a> arts in our community was put into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6001.984s">I</a> believe it was $25,000 at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6004.686s">And</a> it's something that we've made sure that it was put in year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6009.909s">Now,</a> I look back a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6012.67s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6014.491s">I</a> look back a few years ago, and at the time, it was President Stephanie Muccini-Burke who was the chairperson of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6020.614s">And</a> we did have a proposal for an art center here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6024.777s">And</a> the only three councilors at the time that supported it, for whatever reason, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6029.404s">was</a> Councilor Carr, Councilor Marks, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6033.067s">Now,</a> all the councilors have their own reasons why they didn't, and I respectfully understand their reasoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6038.652s">But</a> there's been proposals over the years that have come up, so to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6044.537s">But</a> with that being said, as Councilor Caraviello just stated, too, I think, and I brought this up in the past, I think the Chevalier Commission has to look in the direction, too, of allowing <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6054.852s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn mentioned a few minutes ago about having a nice movie with popcorn and sitting down with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6060.056s">But</a> unfortunately, unless you change your rule, popcorn's really not allowed in there during the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6065.26s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6067.121s">Correct,</a> yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6068.858s">Yeah,</a> right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6070.039s">So</a> right there is part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6073.301s">Concession</a> stands is what's keeping Lowell alive a lot, as well as Lynn, because people are going up to the concession stands, and they're buying a 12-ounce beer for $5, and it's costing the place a nickel. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6086.53s">So</a> the city has been supportive over the years of putting some ideas and stuff out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6092.794s">And</a> the management company, and I understand, you're in a commission role. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6097.917s">And</a> that's certainly different than being an actual manager of a theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6101.32s">And</a> the city maybe should have taken a bigger investment on the management side of bringing in somebody that's paying and that's their whole entire job is getting behind the shows to come in and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6115.134s">But</a> I think we have to change with the times as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6118.277s">I</a> think the marquee is a wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6122.162s">Hesitant</a> to the fact to have some advertising going on it other than the shows that are there Because I think that would essentially be another billboard type thing on Forest Street, and I wouldn't be totally for that to be honest with you But as long as we keep the integrity of the building as long as the Historical Commission signs off on it the Chevalier Commission of course who is in the custody in control of the building and <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6144.748s">as</a> well as I believe it would be the city council for a signed denial permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6148.87s">As</a> long as it goes through the proper channels and gets vetted properly, I'm for this 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6154.033s">But</a> I just think that this council, particularly the council that's here today and not ones of six, seven, eight years ago, have been very supportive of the arts, including the $15,000 that was, I believe, unanimously supported by myself and the other six members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6172.892s">over</a> the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6174.433s">So,</a> I'd just like to say I support your endeavor and move approval.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6376.88s">Hey,</a> for the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6379.121s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6380.382s">Do</a> you say you were going to put your own money and funding behind the show and they turned you down?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6386.306s">Well,</a> no, no, because normally a promoter comes in.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6391.29s">All</a> right, well, I'm just a little confused, because if you brought it to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6394.507s">As</a> a conduit, what is your role in it?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6402.993s">OK,</a> with that being said, you have your own private capital to put on a show.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6466.308s">Just</a> to follow up with the gentleman again, first of all, his facts are wrong, as occasionally they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6471.792s">The</a> city did not put up $15,000 for John Danva. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6474.994s">That</a> was a private entity that went to the Chevalier, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6482.949s">A</a> promoter?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6497.843s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6498.203s">And</a> the gentleman said the city put up the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6499.865s">I</a> know that wasn't the case because otherwise you would have to come through here through the general fund and the budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6506.491s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6530.537s">And</a> I remember, too, it's very easy to get up here and say, I'll bring this guy in and that guy in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6535.419s">But</a> if you don't have the funding to back it up, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6537.207s">I'll</a> give you a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6538.23s">A</a> few years ago, Representative Donato put his own capital behind it, had an outstanding show, Michael Amante, right down here in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6546.319s">The</a> place was packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6547.28s">The</a> local limousine companies were busy, the livery services, the restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6551.843s">But</a> Representative Donato took a leadership role and put up his own private capital in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6558.807s">So</a> Medford Kiwanis did it with Lou Rawls. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6562.11s">Lou</a> Rawls. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6563.05s">Lou</a> Rawls. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6564.171s">So</a> to say that they're just going to come, I mean, that's a fragment of people's imaginations.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6589.387s">I</a> think we have to be clear, because it was a statement that was made that the city of Medford put up the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6594.83s">And</a> as much as we'd like to, that's not the case at this <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6599.518s">at</a> this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6612.325s">It's</a> a big difference being a groupie with the people that play at nightclubs and tavern-type things, and actually being a promoter that brings in shows, writes a check to the Chevalier Commission for $25,000, $30,000, and then works off commission and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6627.815s">It's</a> a huge difference, and I've witnessed it firsthand through the likes of the Kiwanis and Representative Donato, so.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6636.66s">Yeah,</a> no, I just thought that was important, because I didn't want the taxpayers to think that we were just fronting money for shows at the Chevalier Auditorium.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6680.747s">Like</a> I said, the gentleman, I deal with facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6684.048s">I'm</a> certainly not going to go low and talk about the judge's order that was written and basically talked about the caliber of the individual that was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6692.61s">That's</a> for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6693.71s">But</a> facts and figures are important when you're at the people's forum.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6738.03s">If</a> we're going to have a gentleman that walks around here just screaming and yelling, I mean, you may want to do something as the presiding officer, because it's certainly disruptive to the entire group of people that are out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6748.713s">If</a> he has to be escorted off the grounds, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6751.574s">But</a> I'm actually a little bit nervous with the behavior that's being shown by that gentleman right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7600.489s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7602.691s">I</a> respectfully disagree with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7606.234s">I</a> have had the honor and the distinct pleasure to serve with the lady in question on this city council and have been through several budgets with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7614.941s">She</a> has the utmost integrity of high caliber. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7619.904s">And</a> I am sure that she's doing what is right according to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7624.987s">And</a> if she feels that resigning on May 15th is the way to go, then I support it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7631.652s">I</a> just, like I said, I just, the utmost integrity this woman has. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7636.115s">So</a> I just respectfully disagree with my council colleague, and I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7641.818s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7672.81s">Well,</a> as just a little quick follow-up, and I'm going to let it go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7677.593s">I'm</a> sure, and I haven't had any conversations with her since she announced to be a candidate for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7685.479s">And</a> I am sure, knowing her and the input and just the way she goes about her every day doing her job, she is doing it within the confines of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7696.426s">And</a> I have no question about anything as it relates to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7702.114s">I'm</a> not ready to take any type of vote on this other than to just say, I'm just letting my feelings be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7709.799s">Madam</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8210.41s">Thank</a> you, and I certainly agree with my colleague, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8215.554s">The</a> gentleman's just going about doing things on his own. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8219.597s">We</a> have a piece of property that abuts that, directly behind it, that is, we're going to be doing a multi-million dollar clean-up down there at some point, and there's been excavating equipment out there, moving the dirt around, and the dirt is touching buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8237.682s">systems,</a> at least they're monitoring for the chemicals that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8241.403s">I</a> mean, this isn't environmentally... If they're taking dirt out, where's the dirt going? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8245.464s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8248.164s">So</a> I think we have to send this to the Board of Health as well, Councilor Penta, to find out what's going on with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8254.245s">And</a> the other thing is, too, you know, you have people in this community, city employees, that do their due diligence and take their jobs very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8265.087s">After</a> city employees have done their jobs and inquire, what's the equipment for, and this and that, and asking where your permits are and all that, one of the gentlemen that's in this particular establishment is going in and basically threatening other businesses, saying they called the city on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8282.124s">I</a> mean, this guy's a vigilante running roughshod down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8287.516s">And</a> it's just totally unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8289.378s">And</a> the business owners are basically looking at him like a deer in the headlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8293.641s">Like,</a> what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8295.362s">It's</a> in the West Medford Municipal lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8298.104s">It's</a> the West Medford Municipal lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8302.888s">You're</a> underneath the, you have 300, 400 cars pulling in and out of there during the days, I assume, between all the different venues down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8312.156s">So</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8314.859s">I</a> think the city has to actually get a handle on what's going on down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8318.081s">Interesting</a> enough, I know the gentleman has the proper seating for the beer and wine license, and I quite honestly don't know what the definition of a cordial is. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8329.788s">I</a> know bigger restaurants in the community that have gone out and put the proper seating in to have full liquor licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8337.076s">and</a> made an investment in the pay and higher insurance bills and everything else due to those licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8342.624s">I</a> mean, are they at a disadvantage if they're serving stuff that doesn't conform with the particular license? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8347.711s">I</a> really don't know, to tell you the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8349.814s">So</a> this is all things that our department heads have to get back to us on, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8354.293s">and</a> then move forward in the appropriate manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8356.515s">Because</a> the biggest thing that disturbed me the most, though, like I said, with everything aside, going in and basically yelling at other business owners when there's a full store full of customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8367.524s">You</a> called the city on me and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8369.005s">Well,</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8369.545s">If</a> you do things right, you don't have to worry about anyone calling the city or a building inspector coming on your property and making sure you're doing things right. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8376.251s">Just</a> do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8377.192s">I</a> mean, Councilor Penta just read an advertisement talking about the seating and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8383.223s">It</a> hasn't even been before this council yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8385.065s">I</a> have a serious public safety issue I'm going to be looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8388.648s">What</a> if a car pulling out of a parking spot? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8392.562s">puts</a> the car in drive and goes right through this patio with 30 people eating on it down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8397.186s">I</a> mean, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8397.926s">Is</a> there going to be bollards? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8398.747s">Is</a> there going to be some barrier in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8401.529s">Is</a> it the border health an issue where the diesel trains are going by and out there eating? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8406.113s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8406.914s">But</a> this is where our department heads have to give us the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8410.516s">And</a> as long as the gentleman's doing everything right, good luck to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8414.239s">But</a> as far as I can see right now, from what I hear, and I know early on, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8420.538s">There</a> was some questions with the way the liquor license was written up. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8422.98s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8423.42s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8424.681s">Um,</a> and the way he was approaching his business, but serious, uh, disadvantage to businesses that are conforming to the rules and standards like counsel Penta stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8433.929s">So,</a> uh, I support having this sent to our department heads.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9926.151s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9927.572s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9930.333s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9931.394s">And</a> I've been a member of the school committee in the past and a member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9937.498s">And</a> I certainly respect the clear delineation <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9941.27s">of</a> the roles of each particular body. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9944.431s">The</a> school committee puts together a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9946.611s">They</a> come to the city council with that bottom line number, and we either say yay or nay on the overall funding package. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9955.974s">A</a> lot of good stuff has been going on in the schools, but there's also some questions, like Councilor Prentice said about the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9962.095s">That's</a> the first I'm hearing of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9963.776s">I</a> know that they're going to be bringing some new programs into the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9969.448s">in</a> the very near future, and I'm not so sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9973.35s">I</a> just haven't heard what you're saying, and I'm sure there is probably some truth to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9978.152s">Somewhere</a> in the middle, there's something going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9980.633s">But</a> I really believe that this is a school committee issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9984.855s">We</a> have school committee members that do a great job getting into that budget during the budget process, so I will not be supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9993.86s">Just</a> for the mere reason that this is a school committee issue, as far as I'm concerned, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9998.504s">And</a> I respect the budget that they put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10002.385s">And</a> in most of these positions, too, are subject to some sort of collective bargaining agreement, I would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10011.909s">There's</a> very few employees that are at will employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10015.45s">I</a> know there's some confidential secretaries, but most of the people are in the administrator's union or the teacher's association. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10023.777s">So</a> that's the majority of the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10025.738s">And</a> then the rest is the nurses and the paraprofessionals, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10029.741s">But</a> most of them are under a collective bargaining agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10032.923s">So</a> for those reasons, I wish the school committee well as they prepare their next budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10727.725s">Yes,</a> just real quick on the Narcan and just want to thank Councilor Lungo and Councilor Penta for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10733.748s">As</a> well as just send another thank you to Janelle Rocco, who was working hard to put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10740.53s">And</a> also Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10742.771s">Councilor</a> Penta was one of the main speakers today at the event out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10747.042s">Many</a> people didn't know what was going on when they seen Councilor Penta in front of City Hall with a bullhorn today. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10752.786s">Many</a> people were questioning whether it was your announcement for Mayor or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10756.768s">So,</a> with that being said, I want to congratulate the Councilor for partaking in it today.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11224.993s">Nope,</a> I'm all set.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11307.014s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11308.535s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11308.995s">And</a> just to refresh everyone's memory, probably within the last month and a half, I had brought forward a proposal and it was, I believe, unanimously supported by the council, but I'm not 100% sure on that, for the mayor to go out and solicit input by using a poll or something like that for data so that we can make decisions based upon data and statistical <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11330.587s">driven</a> decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11332.888s">So</a> maybe if we can incorporate that into something like this, maybe, because basically you're reaching out to people in the community, but you want to get a good idea of what's important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11344.614s">And</a> I believe Cambridge just did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11346.575s">And</a> the biggest thing, like you said, was they let the younger kids participate, whether it was a skate park or this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11352.558s">And</a> this was within the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11354.579s">I</a> remember reading it in the Globe South, I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11357.541s">So</a> it's a pretty interesting concept.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12493.217s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12494.038s">We're</a> in receipt of a paper this evening from the city solicitor who basically says that the mayor is the only, it happens to be on the parking question we asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12503.022s">But</a> it basically says that all contracts involved in the amount of $5,000 or more shall be in writing and no such contract shall be deemed to have been made or executed until the approval of the mayor under plan A. So clearly this is a function of the mayor and him being the issuing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12521.252s">With</a> that being said, I think we have to find out where the city is going as far as the public access component. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12527.632s">Because</a> if it's going up at the high school, I think people have to, I would be very cognizant of the fact that we have to have people quarry cleared. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12534.956s">So</a> that to make sure if they're in the same areas and buildings as youngsters in our community, that we want to make sure that the proper <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12544.335s">People</a> are vetted for that, for less of a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12548.538s">I</a> really don't know much about this bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12550.659s">This</a> is something that was put on under suspension this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12554.322s">I</a> don't even recognize any of the names of the people that signed on to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12558.605s">If</a> I saw a name like Donato or Garbally or some of the other reps or senators that I'm familiar with and are familiar with some of their policies, I would be a little bit easier to at least support it this evening in its infancy stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12574.153s">But</a> for those reasons, I don't think we should be taking a vote on this at this particular point, not knowing where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12581.898s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12775.162s">That</a> I put forward to find out about where we're going with access and the Corey piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12780.944s">Want</a> to make sure that everyone's Corey clear.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g/2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g.html">Medford City Council - April 21, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=584.403s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=588.244s">I'd</a> like to move suspension of two papers, 15-307 and then another one in the hands of the clerk that Councilor Penta submitted regarding the parking kiosks.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=604.668s">Yeah,</a> the revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=607.389s">Unfinished</a> business.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1016.906s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1018.047s">And</a> it was a few weeks ago when Councilor Penta brought the paper forward to get rid of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1024.13s">And</a> at that point, I had stated that I'm getting very close to supporting his resolution, but I wanted to see it take <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1031.758s">take</a> a few more weeks and just to see if they could get things straightened out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1035.68s">Obviously,</a> at this point, the mayor and his top officials have not held this company accountable, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1044.103s">So,</a> in light of that, I have a resolution I'd like to submit on behalf of Councilor Pinter and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1049.91s">basically</a> that says that in light of the recent actions of Republic Parkins job performance and the failure of the city administration to hold them accountable Be it resolved that the mayor and his top administration officials remove the pay-to-park kiosks throughout this community It's to the point now where it's loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1069.054s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1070.615s">This</a> is a complete failure of <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1072.66s">This</a> is a complete failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1073.701s">And</a> I understand the mayor's very busy, but he had his top people put this thing together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1079.065s">This</a> wasn't the new schools they built. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1081.927s">This</a> wasn't the DPW yard that looks so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1085.53s">For</a> whatever reason, this has been a complete and utter failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1089.112s">And</a> I just think it's time that we move forward with doing in-house parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1095.477s">And</a> I asked a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1096.378s">I'm</a> going to actually have it up a little later. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1098.019s">A</a> few weeks ago, I actually asked, and the council supported this unanimously, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1102.093s">for</a> a copy of all the transfers that have taken place from July 1st to now, because I wanted to see what money out there they're transferring around within the budget, because obviously that's overtaxing the people, and everyone talks about how fiscally stable this community is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1117.621s">It's</a> only because they overbudgeted, and at the end of the year, it gets certified and put into the free cash accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1122.863s">It's</a> obviously what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1124.004s">You</a> don't get $6 million in a rainy day certified free cash account if you're not overtaxing the people during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1131.192s">And</a> they're not too quick to give us that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1133.494s">So</a> once again, I'd ask Budget Director Burke to send us this information forthwith. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1139.098s">And</a> at that point, look and see if we have additional funding so that we can either purchase some of the equipment to do it in-house, whatever has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1148.725s">But</a> the public outcry from the citizens of this community, it's, I'm done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1153.329s">Yesterday,</a> Mr. President, yesterday, people parked their cars on streets in the whole West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1160.697s">The</a> whole West Medford area, they parked their cars so they could go down and watch Paul Revere ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1164.64s">And</a> they came back to tickets on their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1166.521s">And</a> the signs clearly said, parking certain hours, excluding holidays, Saturday and Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1176.849s">If</a> Patriot's Day is not a considered holiday, the mayor doesn't have this building open to come down here and pay your water bill, or to come down here and get some information that you may need from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1190.194s">you're</a> going to get a parking ticket the same day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1191.795s">The</a> trash is put off by a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1194.297s">And</a> I just don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1197.719s">I</a> brought this to the attention of the budget director yesterday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1200.802s">She</a> was gracious enough to take my call on a day off, and I explained to her the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1206.606s">But</a> to have the city administration and <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1212.132s">The</a> parking company, not on the same page as far as what consists of holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1215.936s">Are</a> we going to go through this every Bunker Hill day, every evacuation day, everything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1220.381s">It</a> just, it doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1222.103s">And</a> once again, I'm asking, I'm asking to support Councilors Penta's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1227.89s">from</a> a few weeks ago and get rid of this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1232.033s">And</a> like I said, if I can just read it again, and this is offered by Councilor Penter and myself.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1274.862s">No,</a> I get another paper, I'm gonna discuss that later.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1283.975s">Yes,</a> it's going to be an amendment, excuse me, an amendment from myself and Councilor Penta that in light of the actions of Republic Parkings, recent job performance and the failure of the city administration to hold them accountable, be it resolved that the mayor and his administration remove the pay to park kiosks for it with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1302.526s">And,</a> uh, I would request a roll call vote on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1311.891s">And,</a> uh, as I said, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1314.212s">I've</a> been very, very patient, trying not to get to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1317.473s">But</a> after yesterday, and just when you call the office too and ask them, they really didn't have any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1323.435s">I</a> know Councilor Penta mentioned earlier, he called the office and they were rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1327.577s">They</a> weren't rude, they were very nice to me, but they just, well, I have to call another guy here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1331.858s">Somerville,</a> Somerville, as Councilor Marks often says, they jump out of the trees to give you tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1336.96s">Somerville</a> wasn't giving out tickets yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1339.481s">And</a> they bring in $8 million a year with their program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1342.852s">So</a> something's wrong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1345.013s">And</a> at this point, let's get these kiosks out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1348.033s">Let's</a> get the city back to some sort of sense of normalcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1351.234s">And</a> last but not least, as far as I'm concerned, I still think there should be strict parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1358.316s">But</a> do it in a manner that's not so disrupting to the community and with a company or a department here within City Hall that can actually get the job done.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1404.7s">Council</a> President, if I can finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1406.8s">Sorry,</a> Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1410.381s">If</a> I could just finish.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1412.602s">Councilor</a> Penter alluded to the fact that we're having a meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1416.383s">I</a> know I spoke with you earlier today, but I think this meeting should be postponed till when the carnival's out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1421.725s">There's</a> no way to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1423.225s">Based</a> upon the last few meetings on this particular matter, based upon the public outcry with this particular issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1429.248s">To</a> have it on a Wednesday night where City Hall is open and we have this carnival out back here, I just think it's, I think it's doing an injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1436.829s">We</a> got, we got seven of us here tonight, elected members of the City Council, and I think only two or three of us got parking spots on City Hall property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1444.451s">It's,</a> I just don't think we should move forward with it tomorrow night, but that's my humble opinion and whatever the Council sees fit.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2108.977s">contract</a> where they haven't you know, there's just so many unanswered questions and Just just another thought Thank you, and I thank councillor lungo current for her thoughts and like I said this this resolution didn't come easy but it's at a juncture where They just keep every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2134.239s">It's</a> something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2134.82s">It's</a> something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2135.42s">It's</a> something new <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2137.498s">Street</a> sweeping has not started yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2139.319s">We</a> tick it in and toe, well, it has started, but like in full force, tick it in and towing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2143.64s">And</a> just enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2147.022s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2147.682s">We're</a> having a meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2148.782s">You're</a> going to have to park at Representative Donato's office down on Salem Street to walk here because there's going to be no parking in the immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2158.406s">Obviously,</a> and that's why I still say that we should cancel this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2161.487s">I'm</a> only one of seven, but to give people the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2165.226s">Councilor</a> Caraviello this evening is parked up behind Tony Lucci's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2169.327s">I'm</a> parked down in an adjacent parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2173.188s">Other</a> members of the council are parked far beyond the area of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2177.569s">I</a> just think it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2179.749s">And</a> we don't have City Hall open this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2181.71s">City</a> Hall is closed for all intents and purposes tonight except the Medford City Council members, a few people from the administration that were here earlier, as well as the few guests that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2192.15s">But</a> to do it tomorrow night, and I respectfully, I understand what Councilor Marks says, but we're not going to get the administration back at the table in two weeks or four weeks to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2202.172s">So</a> I just, that's my thoughts and I would like to see it canceled and move forward to a date that, and you know what, if no one shows up at that point, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2214.154s">But</a> it's incumbent upon us to get the community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2217.574s">We're</a> the people's forum and that's why <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2221.302s">If</a> yesterday didn't happen, I would have been bringing this up tomorrow evening with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2225.965s">But</a> after yesterday, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2229.448s">I'm</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2230.989s">I</a> mean, I'm not going to be changing my mind on their performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2233.591s">The</a> mayor and his senior staff, they're holding this company accountable.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2558.112s">Just</a> one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2560.213s">If</a> we also could get an update, I believe when the budget was put together by the budget director and the city administration, anticipated receipts from this anticipated program is in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2573.3s">So</a> that may be why they don't want to pull out of this as quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2577.122s">So</a> if we could ask that question, because they factored this year's budget, I'm assuming based upon the income from this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2585.743s">We've</a> asked for the data, and we still don't get it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2601.372s">FY</a> 2016 budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3643.767s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3648.122s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3648.762s">If</a> I may, as well, too, we have to send a loud, clear message to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3654.747s">He's</a> done so many great things for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3657.188s">This</a> thing has not been done the way it could have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3661.512s">But</a> at this point, we have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3663.813s">So</a> I agree with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3666.255s">At</a> this point, we have to make the statement that we think that this was a complete and utter failure, done under different circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3673.44s">Maybe</a> it would have worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3674.361s">But</a> obviously, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3677.167s">I</a> hear about this particular issue everywhere I go every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3682.429s">So</a> I think that this vote, it's not long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3688.251s">For</a> me, it's about 24 hours overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3690.472s">Because</a> as of yesterday, when the frosting on the cake was people going on a holiday and parking and getting citations, and it's time to just move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3704.565s">And</a> I think, as I stated in the resolution, as a result of the breach of contract, remove the kiosks and have enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3712.048s">And</a> I, as one member of this council, and I believe all the councillors chimed in at the Committee of the Whole meeting when we were there, there were several meetings with the budget director, Stephanie Burke, as well as the mayor, who instituted the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3725.293s">Loud</a> and clear, we said we preferred meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3729.034s">Single</a> head or double head meters, where people would just throw a quarter in, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3732.318s">No</a> one could say they didn't know how to work them, didn't know how to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3736.721s">People,</a> you look at some of the old pitches in Medford Square, they had the meters way back in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3741.804s">So</a> with that being said, obviously, they didn't take our recommendations then. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3746.207s">We</a> have to just go upon the past precedents and the past practices of what happened around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3752.151s">We</a> send recommendations, very few of them get acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3755.953s">There's</a> gonna be no different with this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3758.335s">Let's</a> take a vote as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3760.88s">And</a> if you feel that you're at the point where this is out of control and it should be terminated, vote yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3767.025s">And</a> otherwise, vote no. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3768.806s">But</a> to say that we're going to meet tomorrow night and we're going to get this all straightened out, it's not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3773.81s">We're</a> four months into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3775.311s">We've</a> got a carnival going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3776.552s">We're</a> not going to hear half of the stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3778.174s">People</a> are going to drive here not knowing there's a carnival. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3780.456s">They're</a> going to keep going because they can't get a parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3783.378s">We</a> had a lot of senior citizens that came to the last meetings from different parts of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3787.461s">They're</a> not going to be able to find a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3790.256s">So</a> I really believe I'm just one member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3793.938s">I'd</a> also like to make another amendment to take a vote on holding the meeting tomorrow as a result with a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3799.242s">Because</a> if we get the mayor and the administrative team in here tomorrow, they're not coming back at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3804.245s">They're</a> not coming back at a later date if they decide that they are not going to agree with the council if we do vote to terminate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3810.85s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Penta because, as we said, we are in unison with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3815.733s">It</a> took me a while to get here, but the fact of the matter is <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3820.335s">It's</a> not going to be straightened out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3821.536s">It's</a> not going to be straightened out.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4436.614s">The</a> original paper that was brought forward, 15-307, by Councilor Penta that was on the table, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4442.202s">If</a> we withdraw that whole paper and approve the new one with the language that you just added to, in breach of contract, because I like that language, add Councilor Lungo Kearns to that, I think we all get what we're looking to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4456.739s">Which</a> is, and here's the other piece too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4460.899s">Oh,</a> leave the kiosk only? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4462.78s">It's</a> clear in the resolution I submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4464.861s">Remove,</a> and Councilor Penta, remove the kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4468.183s">We</a> could have in-house enforcement tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4469.744s">People</a> do not like the kiosk approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4472.066s">They</a> hate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4472.806s">They</a> absolutely hate being able to go to the kiosk and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4475.668s">They</a> don't know how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4478.469s">I'm</a> pretty computer savvy and it was a hard time the other day when you use your credit card and you're trying to add time to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4485.072s">How</a> much time do you want to do max, this, that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4487.534s">It's</a> overwhelming to people, these kiosks, the user side of things.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4494.68s">That's</a> my recommendation.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5614.571s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5615.031s">And</a> I just have a little problem with this where, and this is no disrespect to you, Matt, where Matt is uploading these and it's not an official city employee that's actually doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5627.141s">And</a> the reason I say that, I've been very consistent with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5631.864s">When</a> other people wanted to put stuff on the webpage or on something, I think it has to be, should be done by a city official in some sort of a capacity that could be held accountable if indeed they went a little haywire and put something on there or the wrong link was, you know what I'm trying to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5651.595s">Certainly</a> I don't think you'd ever do anything malicious. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5654.397s">But</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5657.213s">I</a> just think it's more of a city function. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5659.554s">It</a> seems like you got this all into a compact area where at least it's all the data and the videos are collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5669.796s">But</a> this is something that really the city IT department, not Mike Ferretti, but the website management, Alison Goldsberry and whoever else runs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5678.339s">I</a> know at one time the city webpage was done by Councilor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5682.26s">She</a> did a great job with it, getting it to this new platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5685.161s">But</a> at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5687.422s">At</a> this point, I think what we need to see is this done by a city employee that, like I said, in no disrespect to yourself, and this is something the council called for of a Ponya recommendation, actually, but I definitely think this should be done by a city official and not an outside entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5704.908s">If</a> the city wanted to enter into a contract with the gentleman to do it, maybe for a small stipend or something, but where he's held accountable and it has to be done on time and everything else, I could see something like that, but that certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5717.465s">up</a> to the mayor's office, but I just, the next precedent would be what if someone else wants to upload something and they're not as credible as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5726.827s">You</a> follow me?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5733.189s">Well,</a> they're the ones that are going to have to respond to put the links on the webpage, so.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7566.443s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7566.684s">If</a> we could also, um, once again, I brought it up, uh, about a month or so ago to send it to the mayor and the director of budget and personnel, the DPW commission position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7577.052s">Um,</a> the personnel director posted the job on the webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7580.074s">Then</a> it came down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7580.975s">Now</a> I'm hearing they're not filling the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7583.897s">So</a> this is another example of us funding a position within a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7590.787s">for</a> over $100,000 a year, and them not doing what the intent was. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7595.95s">And</a> this is why I asked for the transfer list.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7607.617s">The</a> status of the DPW job.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w/2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w.html">Medford City Council - April 7, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2748.955s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2749.996s">And</a> I said what I had to say regarding the noise a few weeks ago, that I was sure the Lawrence Memorial Hospital would do whatever they could under his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2758.122s">But</a> this evening, I would like to publicly thank, number one, and congratulate Mr. McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2765.348s">You</a> know, there's no one better, no one better, in my eyes, to run our local hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2771.713s">Someone</a> that's volunteered there, has been a member of the board for 20-plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2777.455s">And</a> he's committed to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2780.397s">And</a> when we're on the bigger horizon of possibly merging with an international institute that's known for medicine throughout the world, I don't think there's anyone better that could be in charge than Mr. McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2796.708s">So</a> as a city, we're very lucky that we have this young gentleman here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2801.571s">So</a> I want to wish you well in your new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2804.633s">And</a> very, very, very responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2807.967s">I've</a> had a column three times in the last few months and gets back to the same day and meets the needs of this community every time that something within reasonableness is requested of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2819.269s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3572.559s">I</a> was just going to speak after this paper, if we could take a few other items on the suspension.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4083.37s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4084.77s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4085.851s">If</a> I may, in the past, my take on this whole merger has been I'm looking at a trend in the medical field in greater Boston, which is unique in its has the best teaching hospitals around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4099.937s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4101.422s">There</a> is a major trend from the 1990s to today that hospitals... When's the last time we saw a new hospital opening? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4109.287s">1937,</a> when Daniel Lawrence opened this up, or whatever the year was? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4112.609s">Hospitals</a> are tending to close now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4114.951s">New</a> England Memorial, right here in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4117.112s">It</a> was sitting as a vacant building up until recently, a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4120.414s">The</a> Malden Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4121.675s">The</a> Whitten Hospital was on its last breath, and Cambridge Health Alliance came in and bought it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4128.039s">In</a> the Boston Globe yesterday, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4130.592s">The</a> Spaulding Hospital for Continuing Medical Care North Shore, 275 employees, 160 beds closing this September. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4139.578s">This</a> September. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4141.38s">Now</a> that's going to become a vacant building up in Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4144.121s">The</a> last thing I want to see as a city councilor is a vacant building in the Lawrence Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4150.052s">That's</a> the last thing I want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4151.873s">I</a> am convinced, based upon statistical data that we've been watching in this greater Boston area, on the South Shore, on the North Shore, and throughout the nation, that without mergers of this nature, we're not going to have a hospital in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4166.664s">Mrs.</a> Casey, we don't know what she may look out the window and see up in her neighborhood, quite honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4173.649s">And</a> that within itself is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4175.29s">It</a> could change the whole character of an entire neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4178.729s">So</a> as far as I'm concerned, I think that this is, I still think that this is definitely a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4185.833s">People</a> are concerned as far as employees up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4188.074s">It's</a> a major employer of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4191.336s">But</a> I'd rather see people that are employed up there have an opportunity to go work for some entity on Lawrence Road that's a healthcare facility than get a pink slip, close its doors, and now they're collecting unemployment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4205.123s">I</a> think it's the way lesser of two evils. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4207.788s">So</a> for all those reasons, plus I think we're in good hands with the leadership at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital right now, I think it's the premier time to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4218.914s">Because</a> with all due respect to people out there that may be against this, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4225.112s">This</a> might be the only thing that keeps that building alive, vibrant, and accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4230.136s">And</a> let's not forget about another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4232.458s">Urgent</a> cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4233.979s">1984,</a> you didn't even hear of urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4236.381s">1995,</a> you didn't even hear of urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4238.102s">Urgent</a> care is servicing just as many patients a day, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4242.225s">Am</a> I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4243.326s">Then</a> the emergency rooms in this entire area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4246.448s">People</a> don't want to have to wait three hours to get a quick two stitches on their finger because they cut a piece of meatloaf or something at their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4253.434s">They</a> want to go into urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4254.935s">They're</a> in and out within 45 minutes an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4256.757s">That's</a> what most of them pride themselves on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4258.858s">We</a> have one right up here at the Lawrence Memorial site that's open up until I believe seven o'clock at night.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4264.463s">Winchester</a> Hospital is opening them up everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4266.544s">You</a> can go to Wilmington and get into Winchester Urgent Care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4268.766s">You</a> can go <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4270.658s">You</a> can go, I believe it's Redding, there's another urgent care.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4275.76s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4276.32s">So</a> the trends are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4278.44s">And</a> for us to sit here and not obviously look at the statistical data, I'm not saying that we're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4282.642s">But</a> I think this is very unique because I think based upon the conversations that have been behind this rail over the past few years regarding this merger, as you said, since 2012, I think we're all cognizant of that fact for the Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4296.746s">Because</a> I've already heard from people over on Sampson Road and on the backside of the hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4300.797s">where</a> the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the nursing home agreed to grow bushes recently and bring in bushes to protect some of the integrity of the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4308.664s">I</a> know the original agreement.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4335.049s">I'm</a> not sure why you would insinuate that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4340.37s">It</a> was a mutual agreement originally in the original plans with the city of Medford back when that nursing home was built, when you were on the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4347.092s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4350.553s">Council,</a> we're on the same page here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4352.033s">We're</a> on the same page here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4353.894s">So</a> like I said, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4355.634s">I</a> think we have to continue to endorse this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4357.755s">I</a> think the city council should go on record <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4359.956s">sending</a> another letter to the new attorney general that the city council supports this merger with partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4366.879s">And,</a> uh, at some point, if the attorney general will not allow that to go through, I would personally recommend the board and, um, in the powers to be to start pursuing other relationships with other hospitals that may be smaller, that the attorney general will allow to pass, because that's the only future I think we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4386.325s">having</a> a medical facility in the Lawrence Road area, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4390.506s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4411.871s">Well,</a> if you notice in the, if you notice in the, in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4416.255s">The</a> paperwork that was filed by the judge, they didn't even talk about the North Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4422.197s">It</a> was all about the South Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4425.098s">And</a> I would say, given the relationship of the North Shore area with the folks in Boston, I would say they'd be more palatable to seeing this side of the merger go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4445.978s">As</a> a community, I think we owe it to the workers, and as you stated, the nurses and everyone else up there, to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4451.32s">If</a> we really believe, like I do, and I'm not saying we all do, but if we really believe the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to be closed within a few years if a merger doesn't take place, then I think it's our job and duty to ask them to continue the negotiations and the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4465.645s">And</a> that's it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4533.466s">Thank</a> you, Mr. I would like to make a motion to send that same exact letter that we sent out to the authorities at the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4541.553s">I</a> believe it was to the attorney general as well as the other agencies that were involved in the merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4546.118s">The</a> same letter to the new attorney general where the leadership has changed in the AG's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4551.223s">And</a> I'd like to have a roll call vote on that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4564.67s">It</a> was supporting the merger in its, um, not in the specifics of it, but in the principles, the principles that were being spoke about.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5215.796s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5217.057s">I</a> am very happy that the mayor has brought forth the two names he has this evening, Mrs. Beatrice, as well as Mr. Jim Tarani, who have been serving in this capacity and doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5226.703s">And</a> I move approval on the paper before us.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5466.468s">Please</a> record me in opposition of the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5468.088s">And</a> I was ready to move on this this evening, but, uh, that's council motion to table as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6147.035s">First</a> of all, I would like to go on record in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6150.218s">These</a> Medford residents that are employed through this, Medford taxpayers, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6156.15s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6157.27s">Number</a> two, and I don't mean to say this inflammatory, but the gentleman that just spoke brings up issues about the federal government after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6165.532s">Common</a> Core we talked about, which we have no jurisdiction over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6168.272s">We</a> talked about probably 27 times here at the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6171.933s">We've</a> talked about oil coming from other countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6174.733s">We've</a> talked about many issues that we have no jurisdiction over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6178.754s">This</a> is well within the right of any city councilor to bring forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6182.955s">Just</a> earlier, within the last hour, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6186.325s">We</a> talked about the nurses that may be losing their jobs at Lawrence Memorial Hospital, and doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6192.468s">So</a> to say that this is going on uncharted territory, as our fine city solicitor would say, that's fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6200.631s">So</a> I do support you, Councilor Knight, and I support the working people that go to Tufts University every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6206.001s">and</a> they do a fine job, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6208.903s">Too</a> many things around here are getting taken over by machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6211.725s">You</a> drive on the toll booths now, you drive through with your little fast pass, how many people lose their jobs? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6216.669s">You</a> go to the touch bank now, you go to the ATM instead of using people that actually work the counter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6223.414s">Technology</a> is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6226.67s">But</a> at the end of the day, you need people to do the jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6230.213s">So</a> as far as I'm concerned, I support these working men and women that are here this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6236.438s">I</a> do not know the language of their contract, but in principle, as we talked about earlier, in principle, I support them wholeheartedly, and I support Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6246.105s">But</a> to talk that we're going down uncharted territories, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6250.208s">I</a> mean, I'd like to just take an hour to go back and look at the records of just this calendar year and see how many things we've talked about that have no jurisdiction of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6262.393s">So</a> I do support the council that brought this forward this evening.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6393.362s">Mr.</a> President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6395.402s">Thank</a> you for your point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6396.763s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6399.363s">Just</a> a point, and then just real quick, but the city of Somerville is <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6405.649s">having</a> the same type of resolution slash, not hearing, but the individuals as well as representatives from the city of Somerville, a meeting on April 9th on this very same matter.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7780.267s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7781.287s">And</a> I do want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn, because a lot of this does start in the schools, and education is an important piece of this puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7791.512s">Also,</a> if, Mr. President, if we could ask the mayor for the update on where the ordinance is, because just in the past few weeks, individuals that attended our meetings, attended our meetings here because their loved ones were affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7805.838s">We've</a> had individuals that attended our meeting, and their loved ones have passed since our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7810.915s">So</a> this is a serious thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7812.636s">It's</a> so fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7816.359s">Every</a> day you're picking up the newspaper, you're reading another name. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7821.043s">So</a> let's get this moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7824.906s">I</a> know the mayor is working on it, and it's floating around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7827.068s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7828.248s">I</a> think this is such an important issue, the mayor should put something out to all the department heads, give them a deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7834.673s">Here's</a> an ordinance that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7835.714s">You</a> have until the end of business on this day to sign off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7838.663s">and</a> at least get it back to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7839.983s">I</a> know they're working on it, but as I just demonstrated via the example that I gave, this is something that's affecting people on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7849.925s">In</a> the past two weeks or three weeks since our meeting, there's been several people that have died as a result of this disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7857.527s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7859.287s">And</a> on a positive note, thank you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, for bringing this forward, because it does all start in the very small ages in our schools.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8436.805s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8437.165s">And</a> just an FYI, a gentleman that was at the podium just was speaking about right turn over in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8443.266s">And</a> that's a great resource for youngsters throughout the communities around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8447.547s">That's</a> closing its doors in the very near future, moving to a faraway community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8452.708s">So</a> that's another resource that people from Medford utilize and is moving on to a new facility outside of the immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8460.63s">So</a> just so as quick as we're adding resources, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8465.108s">To</a> combat the problem, resources for whatever reasons are getting depleted as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8473.892s">So</a> you take 10 steps forward, then it's five back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8478.133s">And</a> it's only getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8479.354s">So</a> thank you again, Councilor Lungo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8756.056s">week</a> or so to see if we can get additional crosswalk signs down in the immediate area near the Two Sisters, in the Seafood, it's still called the Seafood Depot, what's the name of it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8766.962s">The</a> Seafood Grill, I think, but, Seafood Grill, thanks, Councilor Penta, and then down the street as well near Sunnyhurst, just the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8776.907s">A</a> lot of people traverse it, and additional signage definitely will be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8782.472s">And</a> I know Councilor Marks put something on a few weeks ago, a B paper, regarding doing the crosswalks over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8789.295s">So</a> if we can make that a priority as well, because as we all know, we're all got the same emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8794.237s">Since</a> this appeared on the agenda, people from the pedestrian committee have reached out to the entire council about improving crosswalks throughout the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8806.617s">And</a> the one recommendation that was made to me, as well as all the members of the council, and me personally, I think it was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8812.721s">We</a> should be going with the new crosswalk signs, similar to the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8816.704s">They're</a> the fluorescent, real, real bright at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8822.588s">So</a> if we could send that to the DPW.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9196.716s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9197.437s">And</a> I was corrected by my council colleague and the young woman from West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9203.221s">I</a> said Sunnyhurst Farms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9204.582s">As</a> we all know, Sunnyhurst Farms is now Goulding School of Dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9208.125s">I</a> meant to say the West Medford Spa. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9214.472s">Of</a> course.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11054.717s">Exactly</a> what are you saying they should be ticketed and towed for?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11060.199s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11060.499s">I</a> just want to ask the councilor exactly what, I mean, if it's just a sign on the back, the police can't ticket or tow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11069.407s">I</a> mean, are they not inspected?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11075.869s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11092.812s">That's</a> my question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11094.433s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11269.231s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11270.051s">If</a> we could also get an update on the cable to find out when the new, it's not so new anymore, Verizon Fios contract is up for renewal as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11279.213s">Because</a> I thought that they were up around the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11282.893s">No,</a> no, I know they came in after the fact, but I thought that they staggered it so that they would be renewed around the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11288.314s">I</a> had thought that, but.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11660.436s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11663.597s">Thank</a> you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11664.637s">We</a> have a receipt tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11666.197s">of</a> a letter in response to resolution 15-061 from Barbara Rubel at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11674.341s">It's</a> talking about the runoff water regarding the snow that they were dumping from their campus into the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11682.504s">As</a> the neighbor stated, I think it's just as big of a concern as the, as I know residents were concerned where Medford was dumping the snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11691.908s">It's</a> got contaminants in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11693.369s">A</a> lot of times oil and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11696.125s">I</a> don't see anywhere in this letter that addresses if at all there was looked at for environmental issues, other than just saying there was sand underneath the field, a big layer of sand which helps the water drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11711.471s">I</a> have a bigger concern with not the water draining and creating maybe a little moisture down there, but any contaminants, the salt, oil that may be picked up and other stuff that's <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11722.945s">that's</a> on the street surfaces that were plowed and then the snow was dumped. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11726.847s">So</a> if we could just send this copy of this letter, Mr. Finn, up to our Board of Health, just to take a look at and see if in the future any other precautions should be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11736.472s">Because</a> I know in the past, I don't see any difference with this, as Councilor Penta brought up a few years ago, Meadow Glen Mall, remember when they were dumping all the snow from all their other properties, the snow farms? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11746.977s">And</a> we were concerned about the environmental hazards of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11750.159s">So</a> just to make sure that, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11753.174s">It</a> was monitored properly.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11755.897s">And</a> that too.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bfXSmZAO02E/2025-03-21_bfXSmZAO02E.html">Medford City Council - March 31, 2015  (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1005.735s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1006.595s">And</a> thank you, Michelle, for coming down here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1010.697s">Is</a> it the boiler room tower that you're referring to?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1014.738s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1014.898s">Like</a> the smokestack that's out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1016.379s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1017.399s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1018.56s">Just</a> so we're in the area, we can pay attention a little bit more to the exact area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1021.821s">And</a> I just assume that the issue was resolved as I believe some of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1027.242s">So</a> I certainly support <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1029.3s">support</a> the $400 piece, as well as the few amendments that were put forth this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=1034.282s">So</a> hopefully we'll get some solution for our neighbours.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2228.67s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2230.993s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and when this originally came before us, I went back into my records, my electronic mail records. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2239.279s">And</a> on January 7th, 2015, I have an email from Paul Moki, who's our building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2244.563s">At</a> the time, the gentleman at the podium brought it to my attention, as well as several members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2250.768s">This</a> issue is now with the Attorney General's office on this particular house, because they're looking at, as you know, and you've been part of the discussions, you didn't say it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2259.782s">but</a> the Attorney General's office has a program where they'll actually take over the property and get it up to code, up to par, and it would all be leaned and everything like the gentleman said. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2273.606s">With</a> that being said, I think the city has to at this point, looking at the pictures, the roof, the holes in the porch, you get the X on the front, and for those that don't know that, that's for the fire department if they show up to, you don't go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2290.002s">The</a> building down here had the X on it, the red X, and that's strictly to keep our public safety officials safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2297.446s">And</a> before I go any further, I want to tell you, you did an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2302.068s">Very,</a> very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2302.769s">You</a> should be proud of yourself to get down here with your dad tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2305.71s">But</a> with that being said, I really think that the city has to at least go out there, spend the money, even if it's a couple thousand dollars at this point, and at least board it up, fix the hole in the <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2319.057s">In</a> the porch, there's a big hole in the porch that I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2321.738s">Things</a> that are definite safety issues as of right now, if someone walks on that porch, the roof should be at least closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2330.581s">I</a> think that we should do that and at least lean it for that portion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2334.462s">As</a> the gentleman at the podium stated, it's an eyesore and it's in the proper authority's hands of the Attorney General's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2342.419s">But</a> I think it's incumbent upon the city to do the immediate need of at least shoring it up enough to the point where the AG's office comes in with either a bulldozer or whatever the outcome is, but at least make it safe for the exact time being. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2357.747s">Because</a> if a child goes up there, just walks on the porch, runs up on the porch to have them call 911, a young kid walking home from school or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2366.192s">I</a> mean, there's a big hole in the porch that we just saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2369.14s">That</a> is definitely a very much safety hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2372.202s">So</a> if we could also make that part of the record and also ask John Bevuso and Paul Moki to give this council an update from the Attorney General's office on exactly where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2382.009s">The</a> other thing is too, I believe there are some neighbors, as I told you in the past, that are very much interested in purchasing the piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2389.434s">And</a> if there's been any more developments on that, if we could also ask that question as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2398.538s">I</a> believe the issue here is the people that are in the line of the heirs and the common heirs, even when it's not in the will. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2407.822s">Is</a> that what it's called, common heirs? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2409.683s">The</a> line of succession. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2412.844s">All</a> of them are incapacitated from what I hear, and that's what's making it difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2417.306s">And</a> I believe that the attorney may have been appointed by the court or the AG's office as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2423.749s">I</a> can't say that with 100% certainty, but knowing a little background on it and where it's at, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2427.742s">and</a> the timing seems about right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2429.183s">January</a> 7th, I was told that the Attorney General's office is on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2433.125s">January</a> 21st, there's an attorney out at the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2436.686s">And</a> there's been communication between the AG's office and the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2440.088s">So</a> I'm assuming that the attorney is probably appointed through the court by the AG's office.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2457.095s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2457.736s">And</a> I certainly understand your frustrations, but unfortunately, as you know, the city still has to follow the certain procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2464.039s">We</a> could go in with the wrecking ball, and I'm sure all of us, including the mayor, would be for that if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2469.202s">For</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2469.503s">But</a> we have to follow the appropriate procedures and get court orders and all that stuff to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2474.325s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2474.726s">But</a> in the interest of public safety, I think it has to be shored up, at least to the point where it's not... Or put a fence around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2482.09s">Quite</a> honestly, there should be a fence around it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=2483.931s">Well,</a> certainly a fence would be, you know,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3166.561s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3166.901s">And</a> I second the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3172.591s">Council</a> marks was very instrumental with this new development down there in working with the neighbors in the entire Medford City Council To put a charcoal filter on so that the neighbors aren't overburdened by the smell down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3185.239s">So</a> just to Like to bring that point up And we actually have the filtration system right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3192.583s">The</a> gentleman just gave us so uh Once again, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3196.806s">I</a> know the neighbors were very interested in that <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3198.812s">As</a> well as this evening, I got a few phone calls from people that were down in Florida that live on 4th Street, and just wanted to make sure that it was brought up this evening.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3386.762s">The</a> issue was going into the stop and shop in Fells Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3391.345s">We</a> fought to get the additional entrance slash exit going in there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3396.727s">Right,</a> and then to go out onto commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3397.988s">And</a> then long term, I believe it was Councilor Marks or Councilor Penta, asked that to look into the feasibility of having a, what did you call it at the time, right turn only onto the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3411.936s">So</a> that you wouldn't even have to stop at a light.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3425.779s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3921.61s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3921.81s">I'd</a> just like to also comment on the, the build out of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3925.431s">You</a> know, you look back a few years ago and Mr. Gav, when you first entered Medford before century bank was there, it was just the old building, a century bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3933.241s">next</a> door, it was wide open, it was a truck place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3937.164s">It's</a> just, you guys did an unbelievable build. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3939.486s">I</a> especially like the little wall out front. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3941.468s">It's</a> a lot of character and it's just a great escape.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3956.022s">He</a> gave you an interest free loan.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3960.278s">No,</a> I just, I just, seriously, it's a great, it's a great addition to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3966.639s">And</a> especially now, too, if another, if you do move your franchise over to the other building, you'll be doing more updating, I'm assuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3975.522s">We'll</a> have to redo that facility, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3977.062s">So</a> we're looking at, we're looking at potentially two brand new <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3980.677s">state-of-the-art</a> auto sale places on Mr. Gav. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3984.599s">Then</a> you throw in a couple of the Graverones. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3986.259s">I</a> mean, Medford really is becoming... We did have a Nissan facility a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3990.441s">Yeah,</a> the motorcycle dealership, the Nissan dealership. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3993.202s">Mr.</a> Gav really is becoming like the quarter-of-a-mile zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3996.944s">They</a> get the auto mile, we're like the auto quarter-of-a-mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=3999.425s">We're</a> not there yet, but... Which one? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4003.287s">Physical</a> therapist, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4006.188s">Did</a> he get his sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4008.509s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4009.78s">So,</a> yeah, but seriously, Mr. Gavrelli is on the rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4014.844s">Look</a> at the China, I don't mean to digress, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4017.547s">A</a> few years ago, this council took a bold vote to move forward the development of Dragon Villa, and look at it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4023.812s">It's</a> bustling with harrows, and at the time, there was some neighborhood opposition, but the council did what they felt was right, and look at it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4031.098s">So,</a> we're all there in the parking lot meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4035.862s">Good</a> luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4038.278s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4287.97s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4288.871s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4289.611s">I</a> will support sending this to the Traffic Commission for an answer, but there was a lot of opposition to the street hockey, particularly at Playstead Park, from the houses down the end of Century Street at the time, senior citizens and stuff, they were very vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=4305.442s">And</a> I think that's why those signs did go up, but I'll support at least getting an answer from the Traffic Commission.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5156.797s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5158.038s">Two</a> questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5158.858s">The</a> temporary bridge was supposed to go in prior to anything that was supposed to be the first piece of the puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5163.582s">That's</a> supposed to go in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5165.784s">That's</a> supposed to go in the spring.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5185.978s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5186.178s">Cause</a> then the trucks only option before was going down to the Medford square exit and now they can't go on route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5191.742s">And</a> the second thing is I think we have to, um, given the construction that's going to take place, I think we have to look now, I think is the reasonable time period to start looking for a new location for the bus stop in front of the real estate and the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5207.898s">because</a> certainly I don't want to have a bus stop around construction vehicles and there's going to be so much going on down there in that immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5216.004s">People</a> waiting for the bus should not have to be breathing in the diesel fuel exhaust and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5220.928s">So</a> if, um, if this city council, maybe that is, do we have a transportation subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5226.072s">If</a> we can maybe send it to transportation to come up with a feasible relocation for the bus stop, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5234.001s">that's</a> in the immediate area, but definitely that bus stop has to be moved, I think, for public safety, as well as for convenience to the people that traverse that area during this magnificent construction project.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5263.893s">You</a> are correct, but my philosophy is the council is the only authority that has the jurisdiction to move the bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5271.836s">At</a> the time, I was adamantly against moving the bus stop because of the people using it, many senior citizens, children, and other individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5282.287s">I'm</a> not gonna sit here and allow senior citizens to breathe in the fumes from trucks hauling out debris and backhoes and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5290.754s">That's,</a> as far as I'm concerned, we're just lining people up to get sick.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5303.184s">We</a> could possibly move it across the streets, closer to where the overpass is coming from Route 16, down to Route 16 from 93, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5310.974s">On</a> the other side, across from the police station, something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5313.435s">I</a> mean, I certainly wouldn't want my wife or my grandmother or my son waiting for a bus within 20 feet of construction vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5322.581s">The</a> bridge is right there, and the bus stop's right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5325.622s">So</a> if the members of the council agree, I think we should start looking at this as a subcommittee to move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=5331.546s">But</a> I'd like to get a roll call vote on that, Mr. President, and come up with a feasible solution for the users, but also for the MBTA
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7075.352s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7076.673s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7078.054s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7080.135s">I</a> do know that just from firsthand experience that they can be reprogrammed and they are programmed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7086.418s">So</a> at seven o'clock, they don't accept any more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7090.3s">15</a> minutes of 7, quarter of 7 the other day, the machine would only take one quarter from me on Saturday evening because it was still programmed to 7 o'clock rather than 6 o'clock, but it didn't allow me to put in anything after 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7101.987s">So</a> it's definitely the information technology side. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7106.79s">It</a> just has to be adjusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7108.551s">I</a> think what we should also ask the city administration to put out a reverse 911 call advising the entire community <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7116.025s">That</a> the meters are now in effect until 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7119.926s">With</a> the new revised hours so that people it's one way to get it get it out there quick a big blast to the community and And then word of mouth and everything else will take over from all the businesses in our business districts But that's an effective way to get it out there at least Real quick to as many households as we can until the signs of change as councillor mock stated I mean even <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7143.483s">I</a> was trying to be helpful to someone the other day in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7146.404s">The</a> gentleman was a Saturday night, my wife and I were on the way to Medford Square, and there was a guy in West Medford, 6.30, putting his money in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7155.49s">And</a> I turned, we pulled over, the machine's on, sign right here says 7 o'clock, they're going to Bistro 5 or something, they're all dressed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7163.936s">I'm</a> not gonna argue with the guy, I'm trying to do him a favor, he's getting argumentative with me that I'm telling him that the thing's off at 6, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7170.08s">Meantime,</a> I come down the square, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7172.233s">And</a> I just go up to see if it will accept the money, because this has been a topic that's been discussed here at the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7177.334s">And</a> it did take my money until 7 o'clock, and then it shut off, maximum amount of time allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7183.035s">So</a> it can be done, if we can get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7185.895s">Hopefully</a> it's done prior to the meeting you're going to call next week for reprogramming these machines, and also reverse 911 call to get it out there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7242.136s">I</a> can support that but I think they purge all the information according to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7246.32s">They</a> have to purge anything that's not a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7249.382s">I'll</a> support it in theory, but I would be surprised if they can actually do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7252.724s">But</a> I understand why you want to do it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7263.829s">Point</a> of information and councilor Camuso is all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7268.251s">Um,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7268.851s">So</a> if we could ask the administration to do the 911 reverse 911 call as well as reprogram the machines, the company reprogrammed the machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7276.58s">Fort</a> Worth and refunds if you can do it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7916.754s">Could</a> Councilor Penter introduce his resolutions by topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7920.856s">Because</a> first we've got the kiosk stuff, and then it's in with this one, and then we have the National Grid stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7927.06s">Would</a> you be amenable to do that so we can... But it all happened this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7933.493s">I</a> understand but listen we did proper parliamentary procedure I must say so I would just rather vote on it it's like voting it just doesn't make sense the way we're taking a vote on this I'd like to at least break it down by topic you get National Grid you get the kiosks then you get the power outage it's we're all over the map here
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8029.778s">This</a> was to suspend the contract last week.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8037.48s">Roll</a> call to take it off the table.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8792.764s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8796.786s">The</a> gentleman just stated that the bid deadline, I believe, was last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8800.448s">If</a> we could ask <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8801.882s">the</a> procurement department, as well as the solicitor, if there was any qualified bidders, number one, and who they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=8809.67s">If</a> at this point, I'm assuming it's public record if the bids were opened and if they're qualified and responsive to move forward.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9011.539s">Public</a> access cannot be for-profit according to <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9014.727s">the</a> federal standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9017.049s">And</a> we will have something in writing on that from our city solicitor, I'm sure.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9523.567s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9524.948s">On</a> the TV public access, people have referred this evening that there was one bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9531.333s">Do</a> we know who it is and who the board of directors are and stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9534.676s">I</a> know we're going to ask the question, but does anyone have any idea? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9538.82s">Winchester</a> decided not to, all the local ones decided not to put in, right?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9636.066s">Two</a> years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9636.646s">I</a> have a question for the gentleman that submitted a bid.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9642.587s">Do</a> you feel that if you're in charge of that access TV that the people would be coming out of the rafters to participate, Medford residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9649.418s">Yes,</a> sir, I do, because I have a program to do outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9651.7s">I'm</a> very good at outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9653.562s">But</a> you were involved with a lot of the past TV3 stuff that was going on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9685.96s">That</a> came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9686.741s">I</a> think you said it last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9688.861s">Somebody</a> has said it last week that if you're the new board or the new nonprofit will not be able to produce their own shows.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9757.488s">I</a> can put it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9759.038s">It's</a> a non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9759.799s">You</a> can't accept money from businesses to... Wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9762.541s">You</a> just said you're going to go to businesses to get the money to get your non-profit off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9765.544s">Is</a> that what you said?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9773.151s">So</a> do you have the financial backing to get it off the ground? <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9775.413s">That's</a> what I'm asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9776.354s">Yes,</a> I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9777.375s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9777.796s">Right</a> now, if you received a bid, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9780.683s">You'd</a> be able to get it up and running?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9801.297s">First</a> of all, I'm asking legitimate questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9802.938s">And</a> because you don't like the questions.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9815.153s">Right,</a> I don't have to pay to get access to AV to put the equipment in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9818.695s">It's</a> not coming out of my pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9819.736s">Well,</a> you need someone that knows how to design it and everything else to make it happen.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9824.739s">I</a> know how this works. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9825.719s">Well,</a> they're here every week with you, so I'm just sort of questioning the backing that you have as far as getting the job done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9832.172s">The</a> job will be done instantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9833.653s">Well,</a> and the mayor doesn't, like I said, I have a motion and here's the other thing too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9837.436s">Happy</a> anniversary color bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9838.617s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9839.237s">Appreciate</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9840.478s">Um,</a> the other thing, Mr. President, we're still waiting for our report back from the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9845.662s">If</a> the funds can be used for upgrading technology in the community in lieu of the public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9852.047s">So</a> if we could maybe ask the city solicitor for an update on that, because, um, as amended by council, so all those in favor,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9875.199s">But</a> it also can be used for the education channel and the government channel, doesn't it?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9882.264s">But</a> we could do, if the city administration decided to, he could do EGG, get rid of the P and do EGG, educational and government. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9889.793s">You</a> have to read the contract the way it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9891.474s">And</a> I'm fully aware of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9893.335s">Instead</a> of peg, he could do egg. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9894.976s">Educational</a> in government, if we want it done.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=9969.025s">And</a> secondly, qualified and responsive bidders.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw/2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw.html">Medford City Council - March 24, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=77.972s">I</a> pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=99.049s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=100.15s">Move</a> suspension of Rule 33 to take 15-311 and 15-312.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=202.611s">So</a> on the motion of Councilor Camuso for non-objection,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2215.207s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2217.612s">I</a> think that Wendy's has to make a determination, and if they want to proceed with this, I agree with Councilor Marks 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2225.777s">If</a> they want to proceed with this, I think we have to move reconsideration on the 3 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2230.681s">license,</a> or at least put six-month review on the 3 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2234.323s">license,</a> because we could eventually have a real albatross around our neck in the residential neighbourhood, as Councilor Marks stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2242.806s">They</a> have their 3 o'clock license and they get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2245.987s">And</a> we all know that Malden still has bar rooms that are open till 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2251.128s">And</a> traditionally, people get out of there and they'd always head to Wendy's, Kelly's and Burger King. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2256.87s">So</a> I definitely agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2258.47s">This</a> is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2261.171s">Could</a> you speak on behalf of Wendy's and what's more important to the operation right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2265.592s">Is</a> it the seating or is it the 3 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2268.052s">drive-thru</a> license? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2269.193s">Because</a> I can't see <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2270.504s">I</a> can't see doing both of them at this point, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2273.366s">Because</a> we all know that that may be fenced off or a chain or something, but you're still going to have people, I mean, we have other establishments that their furniture gets stolen at 2, 3 in the morning from in front of their restaurants in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2288.574s">So</a> I just don't feel comfortable, to be quite honest, doing both of these at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2293.797s">I</a> don't know how the rest of my council colleagues feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2298.066s">I</a> think if we're gonna do this, we should put a six-month review on the license that we just gave a few minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2306.208s">Would</a> you, can you speak on behalf of?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2313.289s">On</a> both?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2321.191s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2321.451s">Yeah,</a> they do, but they're on the Revere Beach Parkway side. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2323.731s">There's</a> a couple metal tables.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2356.453s">The</a> other thing I would... I agree with Councilor Marks if there's an aesthetically pleasing way where you can do higher wrought iron with a gate that they can actually lock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2366.161s">I</a> mean, if you drive up Route 28, up near Kitty's and stuff, you have some of the smaller restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2371.304s">McDonald's,</a> for instance, has a nice wrought iron fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2374.107s">It's</a> black, but it prevents people from jumping over it and getting in there when they're not supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2381.012s">But</a> the current setup, I just think... I think you're actually asking for problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2386.008s">Um,</a> and I agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2388.009s">It's</a> a very, uh, condensed residential neighbourhood right on the other side of BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2392.51s">And,</a> uh, as you know, you get your air conditioner on on a, uh, nice summer night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2396.851s">I</a> mean, uh, your window's open with the air conditioner off, you can hear things travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2401.112s">So,</a> um, I'd like to, if Councilor Marks is okay with it, I would, uh, I would like to see the six-month review, as the Councilor said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2409.374s">But</a> also, right after this vote's taken, I'm gonna move reconsideration on the initial vote to put a six-month review on that as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2648.287s">Well,</a> Mr. President?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2651.489s">That</a> leads up to something right along the lines, and I think it would be something that Councilor Marks, and I'm not speaking for him, but maybe that would be satisfying to him and myself, because obviously there's some neighborhood concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2666.02s">What</a> about one of those tops that you shut down the whole patio at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2669.493s">It</a> just, you roll it out from the wall, and it comes with the vinyl, so you actually can't walk in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2675.274s">It</a> goes around the four corners.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2685.777s">Yeah,</a> but the table being covered is still gonna not prevent people from going in the patio at three in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2690.598s">So</a> you said cover the tarp? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2693.338s">You</a> know what I'm talking about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2694.398s">Like,</a> pool yards and things like that would actually go, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2697.732s">It's</a> very aesthetically pleasing, and it comes out, and it just attaches to the four corners for lack of the scientific.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2724.584s">Make</a> a motion to have it <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2727.513s">Covered</a> up by virtue of connecting a vinyl something or something aesthetically pleasing to all four corners, so that at 11 o'clock at night, anything within the regular operating hours.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2800.867s">That's</a> what you stated.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2830.199s">11</a> o'clock, it closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2831.92s">Unless</a> someone else has better... I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2835.802s">We're</a> all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2836.783s">I</a> guess it's my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2837.363s">To</a> protect the integrity of the neighbourhood.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3110.205s">Quick</a> question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3114.695s">Does</a> anyone know what time Brewers Patio closes? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3118.098s">Because</a> that's directly across the street, and that's... In Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3122.1s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3122.861s">That's</a> a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3124.022s">2</a> o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3124.282s">It's</a> right on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3124.942s">It</a> is 2 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3125.523s">The</a> patio too? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3126.443s">I've</a> been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3129.065s">The</a> question is, we haven't had any complaints about that, but I think the 8 o'clock is definitely a good start.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3170.962s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3172.183s">Mr.</a> Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3173.384s">While</a> we're under suspension, I'd like to move reconsideration on 15-089.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3196.915s">I'd</a> like to put a six-month review on this, at least present it to the council with a six-month review.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3267.822s">It'll</a> take us two minutes to do it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3303.892s">And</a> it's not a different day, so it doesn't have to be re-advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3306.473s">It's</a> past the notification time, which was 7 p.m., so we're all set just if we read it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3315.987s">It's</a> advertised for the same night that we're doing the recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3318.068s">If</a> I did it tomorrow, maybe it would be a different ball game.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3478.647s">I'd</a> like to move approval with the approval of the Chairman of the Zoning Committee.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3486.091s">And</a> I'd like to just put a six-month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3490.294s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3491.034s">I</a> wish we did this a little earlier, but I do think it's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3496.217s">This</a> is still a residential neighborhood and well-intentioned and well-needed, I think.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3649.721s">And</a> this goes with the business, not with the land.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4361.547s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4362.668s">I</a> certainly see this as a whole different animal than the previous petitioner that was up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4367.171s">This</a> is a restaurant that you actually have to wait in line, get a seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4371.334s">You</a> have to show proper identification if you're going to have an alcoholic beverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4374.696s">So</a> I am totally in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4376.377s">We</a> already have establishments like Margarita's and many others throughout the community that have similar seating arrangements. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4385.843s">Pizza</a> Regina among Joe's American Bar and Grill. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4390.294s">So</a> not your average Joe's, not Joe's American Bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4393.495s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I do support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4397.536s">I</a> just want to make sure that you realize my understanding is you have to go get an extension of your liquor license now if you're going to serve alcoholic beverages on the outside extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4412.079s">Other</a> restaurants in our community have had to do that when they set up patios and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4417.3s">So</a> you want to make sure that everything's in order for insurance purposes, as well as liability with the city and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4424.042s">So</a> I'm not 150% sure on that, but I know another restaurant had to do it, I'm being told by one of my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4433.004s">So</a> I think we have to be very cognizant of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4436.405s">So</a> I second the approval, if it hasn't been done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4439.886s">And</a> then one question to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4443.407s">I</a> know there's been some confusion <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4446.785s">based</a> upon outdoor seating ordinance that this city council worked diligently upon that was put into effect maybe two or three fiscal years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4458.011s">We</a> really didn't delineate in that ordinance whether it was public property or private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4464.114s">So</a> in the past, restaurants like Petucci's wouldn't even necessarily have to come in front of the council for outdoor seating because it was their own property and they owned it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4473.517s">I</a> have pizza Regina and some of the others that I just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4477.42s">So</a> I think we have to go back and revisit the ordinance because I was under the impression at the time it was strictly to protect the city's interests as far as slip and falls on sidewalks when people had the small little chairs out there in front of restaurants like Bocelli's restaurants like muffin shop and several others up on the hillside the Danish pastry house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4501.828s">I</a> think the ordinance was more geared towards that, making sure there was a bond in place and that the city is protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4508.052s">But</a> this is a whole different animal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4509.613s">So</a> I think we should send this maybe to a licensing subcommittee to look at with the city solicitor if we want to update the ordinance where it comes to private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4519.379s">Because</a> like I said, quite honestly, these are the first two vendors we've seen, as long as I can remember, looking for outdoor seating on property that they currently own. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4528.045s">And</a> the other thing is too, we want to make sure we have a mechanism in place <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4531.782s">that</a> we don't get challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4533.762s">They're</a> here under their own will this evening saying, we're here to apply for this because the building commissioner turned around and said, you need it, or the code enforcement officer said you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4543.584s">But</a> that's his interpretation of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4546.384s">There's</a> really nothing in the law that states that they need to be here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4551.145s">There's</a> an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4552.285s">The</a> ordinance is for, this doesn't delineate, excuse me, it doesn't decipher whether it's public property or private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4562.936s">So</a> this is where, this is the first time, like I said, that you look at the other restaurants that have this currently within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4569.201s">They</a> never had to come before the city council for outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4573.084s">So</a> there could be a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4574.405s">And</a> like I said, they're just doing what the building department has told them to come forward because it was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4579.689s">But</a> quite honestly, if you get a vendor that's right in the middle of a neighborhood, that knows they're not gonna get the support of the council because it's in the middle of a neighborhood, they may say, hey, we're gonna take it to Superior Court <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4592.096s">And</a> we're going to challenge it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4593.037s">There's</a> nothing in writing that says private property, you can't have outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4596.679s">So</a> if we could at least send the question to the city solicitor on the alcohol and the extension of the license, as well as private property and outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4607.527s">Because</a> if you look at that ordinance, it was drafted for, there were certain little restaurants on Main Street, High Street, Riverside Ave that were looking for that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4625.368s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4626.508s">So</a> if we could just get a thing, but I support this wholeheartedly, but I just don't want to be challenged at some point if a restaurant opens up, you know, directly abutting a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4638.37s">Directly</a> abutting a neighborhood and then next thing you know, we're in superior court with our city solicitor because there's really no legal mechanism to <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4647.78s">to</a> fall back on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4675.945s">Did</a> that include the questions to the solicitor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4683.428s">In</a> general, not just to them, but the answer for all the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4688.069s">We</a> want to make sure there's consistency.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4693.911s">Thank</a> you for your guidance on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5088.403s">If</a> the entire council will be amenable to, we started the process of drafting an ordinance for the part-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5095.825s">The</a> mayor recently said he was going to actually make it a full-time department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5099.987s">If</a> we could amend it from the floor this evening for the word part-time put full-time, and that's just because the mayor actually said that at a recent event, and asked the city solicitor to start drafting the ordinance that this city council put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5116.328s">Because</a> right now, there's nothing, no mechanism in place to actually make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5121.329s">So...</a> So, to amend that to be a full-time position... Based on what the mayor said, a full-time position in the ordinance, and at this point, too, I mean, we can even strike out some of the language with the qualifications and all that, because that's going to be up to the personnel director, but at least get the ordinance going, because it was initiated here at the city council via a resolution recently.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5146.173s">And</a> as we know, the city council, our job is the budget, it's to create ordinances, is our two biggest functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5154.175s">So</a> if we could amend the word part-time to full-time, and that's based upon the mayor recently saying that he has the funds available somewhere to do this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5163.997s">To</a> send it to the city solicitor though, to start the ordinance drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5167.098s">Because</a> up until now, there's no mechanism in place to put this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5170.399s">So</a> when the mayor comes up with the money, at least the city council got an ordinance in place to fall back on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5178.707s">And</a> can we get a roll call vote on sending that as well?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5182.069s">Because</a> this city council has been very unanimous throughout this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5185.891s">And</a> it's glad to see that there's some working relationship with the mayor's office on this very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5194.376s">Doesn't</a> matter where it was initiated, as long as it's coming to fruition, because it's much needed in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5200.519s">And</a> you can tell that by the turnout the other evening.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5290.544s">Mr.</a> President, the original intent of the ordinance was to have remedial action taken sooner than later, and we started with the part-time, and like I said, it was unanimously supported by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5306.277s">The</a> mayor came out at a later date saying he's willing to do full-time, but as of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5311.17s">Besides</a> the press conference and besides this council going on record in support of it, there's no mechanism in place to put the person in a job with the proper personnel classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5321.194s">So</a> as Councilor Knight stated, we're still going to have to assign a classification to it as we see CAF1, ME02, ME03. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5330.198s">So</a> it's our job as city councilors to initiate and approve or deny ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5335.841s">So</a> this city council has taken the ball, and we're running with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5340.064s">And</a> I'm glad to see the mayor agrees with us that it is needed, and he went as far as to say a full-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5347.288s">So</a> for that, I am thankful.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5395.24s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5396.861s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6164.016s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6166.277s">Just</a> for the Councils, that was a homeroom petition, and the only way to get rid of it would be through another homeroom petition.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6210.341s">Were</a> you referring to the franchise fee question, or the whole, when I just answered Home Rule petition, I wasn't sure if you were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6215.344s">Franchise</a> fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6215.644s">All</a> right, that, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6216.865s">So</a> we're talking apples to apples, okay.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6218.626s">I</a> didn't know if you were talking about the, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6220.408s">Signing</a> of the 10-year contract again, which we're still waiting for the administration to respond if it's a renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6225.553s">The</a> question we asked, but I just wanted to make sure.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6267.148s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6268.649s">Thank</a> you, and thank you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this up this evening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6273.743s">So</a> after last week's meeting, we asked several questions that were waiting for answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6278.886s">One</a> of them in particular was the franchise fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6281.608s">And</a> I think at this point, we're talking about all new technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6285.63s">If</a> no one bids on the public access station, and there's not the interest out there from non-profits to do it, I'd like to ask the city solicitor if he can do some research through the FEC or whoever it is, if we could use the franchise fee for other cable related <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6302.743s">rather</a> than the public access station, like citywide Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6305.424s">A</a> lot of communities now have citywide Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6308.286s">And</a> since this discussion took place last week, there are some people that approached me, I'm sure, talked to other members of this council, that they feel that public access is good, but there is maybe a better need for the money in today's day and age, where everyone has devices that can hook up to Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6327.134s">So</a> if we could at least just ask the question, because as of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6331.028s">The</a> deadline for the bid has been extended and based upon what you hear out there, there's really not that much interest other than maybe Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6344.55s">some</a> other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6346.252s">But</a> other than that, if legally it can be used for citywide Wi-Fi or updating technology into the new schools even more than we already have, somewhere where it will have a better impact on our community and maybe the youth, the seniors, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6363.566s">If</a> we could just ask the question, I'd like to, I support your paper, but I'd like to make a B paper that we ask the solicitor to do research on where else it can be spent.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6374.303s">Amendment</a> or be paid for?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6450.578s">And</a> I definitely hear what you're saying, but I think we need to know what exactly, and you said it eloquently, Councilor Penta, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6457.14s">I</a> can be used for public access educational as well as governmental. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6461.805s">So</a> this could be used potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6464.207s">And</a> this is the question I want to ask this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6466.41s">If</a> we could use this, if there's not not the drive to get the public access done, but to improve the infrastructure for the children of our community, maybe the senior citizen centers throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6477.894s">We</a> can bring technology maybe into their buildings legally, and we might not be able to, but if we could at least ask the city solicitor to look at all these avenues, because when this topic came up last week, I've had several people, and I'm sure other people have heard similar, if not the same thing, but public access is great, but we talked about last week where technology's going, and that's why we're all gonna support, hopefully support this this evening, the 10 years, but with today's technology, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6505.232s">There's</a> probably places we could spend that money, if legally we can, that will have a better impact on the citizens of this community, be it the youth, the senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6515.817s">So</a> if we could just ask the question, we're not saying we want to do this, but if we could just ask the question so we have a better understanding on where it can be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6523.061s">So</a> can I do that as an amendment or a B paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6526.463s">As</a> a B paper with a roll call vote on both, please.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6741.588s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6742.829s">If</a> we could also ask the city solicitor the question, what happens, because I don't have a copy of the contract in front of me as I don't know any of us that do.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6751.732s">What</a> happens at the expiration date? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6755.113s">We</a> want to, I mean, we just want to make sure that they don't just turn the switch and now that everyone that subscribed to Comcast has a blackout and now <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6763.669s">You're</a> waiting for Verizon to come into every house in the community that has Comcast that's going to take two years to get up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6768.75s">So,</a> just want to find out what happens if it doesn't get signed.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6774.952s">If</a> Councilor Penta doesn't mind.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6782.094s">Is</a> that okay, Councilor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7630.345s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7633.426s">I'd</a> like to get the answer because I did look into this because I was getting several people that were interested in putting in a bid if it was for profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7645.337s">I'm</a> not so sure you can have a public access channel that is for profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7648.339s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7649.099s">I</a> would call that channel 457. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7651.161s">You</a> have to give people equal time and things like that, but you do have their out there on the country.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7659.366s">We</a> got to check the FCC regulations and see if, uh, if you can, because like I said, I know people that are interested in doing it, um, quite honestly for profit, but nonprofit is actually, which makes it a vibrant part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7672.914s">And</a> it's not for business, it's not to make money and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7676.697s">So</a> if we could ask that question as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7683.744s">And</a> then the B paper is looking into where else the money can be spent in lieu of the public access, if the city needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7691.23s">Senior</a> housing, internet accessibility citywide, Wi-Fi.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7708.987s">And</a> our technology upgrades to the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7711.769s">And</a> if it can be for-profit according to FCC regulations and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7722.458s">Because</a> I'm not a lawyer, but I would think it has to be non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7727.982s">I</a> would think.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7762.493s">Comcast's</a> website actually says on it that it has to be non-profit according to FCC regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7768.702s">For</a> them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7771.377s">Comcast,</a> I'm sure it's similar with Verizon, ICN.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10150.628s">One</a> thing we have to be cognizant of the fact is if we <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10156.172s">pay</a> the money to get out of this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10159.513s">We</a> are still, as a community, going to own the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10162.414s">We're</a> going to own the kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10164.675s">And</a> then at that point, we could bring in someone maybe from another community that has done this, like Cambridge or Boston, and then do it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10178.841s">But</a> I think we... I'm just not there quite yet, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10185.115s">I'm</a> not there quite yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10188.376s">But</a> in the right hands, with the city being in control of the whole program, with the state-of-the-art equipment, that's what they call it, not what I've seen firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10205.558s">But</a> if we did make the investment, like Councilor Marks said, whether it was on a portion of it or the whole thing, it's not like we're going to scrap the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10215.408s">and</a> just waste $800,000 of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10219.71s">We're</a> still gonna have some equity and we're gonna have some assets that come along with all the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10226.673s">And</a> I do believe that if the right person, if we had a department head here running this program, that that was their job, not the chief of police who's taxed upon too frequently to deal with this when we have real situations going on in the community that need to be dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10245.075s">But</a> to be honest, I'm just not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10247.877s">I</a> agree with what Councilor Lungo-Koehn said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10251.319s">This</a> has been a winter that we haven't experienced in ever, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10258.544s">State</a> of emergency over three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10260.125s">We're</a> trying to get money from Washington because of the amount of snow that we've got from back to back to back storms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10267.589s">The</a> city hasn't been able to focus as much time on this as they should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10273.568s">The</a> mayor should have never started this program in January, whether it was snowing out, no snow, I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10281.071s">Unless</a> we were south of North Carolina, this program should not have started in the midst of a New England winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10291.394s">This</a> should have started when people were out in a short-sleeved shirt with a pair of Bermuda shorts on, and they could take their time at the kiosk, learn it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10302.633s">Not</a> going over snow banks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10309.075s">You</a> throw the snow into this mix, and it's been hectic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10314.196s">There's</a> a car on Barner Ave that hasn't moved since the snowstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10318.037s">Hasn't</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10318.637s">It's</a> right around number 18, 14, right around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10324.618s">You're</a> still dealing with snow banks on all the side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10327.519s">The</a> streets are not back to an acceptable width at no fault of the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10332.863s">But</a> with that being said, I'd like to give it a little bit further to see what they can change. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10342.065s">But</a> Councilor Marks is 100% right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10344.706s">He's</a> 100% right when he says there's not any for-profit company that is not out to make the dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10352.288s">It's</a> all about dollars and cents and bringing in the dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10356.529s">Let's</a> not anyone fool you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10358.209s">And</a> that's going to be the same thing if we go for a for-profit TV channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10362.823s">for</a> public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10363.704s">It's</a> gonna be the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10365.004s">It's</a> gonna be the biggest person that pays the most money to get their advertisement on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10369.527s">So,</a> when you're dealing with for-profit companies, like Councilor Mark said, everything's out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10376.952s">Decisions</a> are made in the boardroom when they're looking at graphs and data and pie charts, and what they wanna do is make those pie charts bigger and bigger and bigger under one of the categories, and that's income. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10390.255s">They</a> want to make the income go up and the expenses go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10393.997s">That's</a> any for-profit company in the United States, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10400.139s">The</a> only time that they want to start slowing down on the revenues is when their tax guy tells them, hey, you're at a point now, why don't you slow down on the revenues? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10407.261s">And</a> they're not doing it because they want to give the Medford person a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10411.523s">It's</a> because they're being advised by their business people to start slowing down for tax ramification reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10420.434s">But</a> like I said, at this point, coming off this winter, starting a program that should not have been started in the midst of a winter, I think the mayor was 150% wrong on that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10435.964s">I</a> don't know how he came to that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10437.765s">I</a> think a lot of it was this council, as well as the business community and people looking for the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10445.471s">And</a> quite honestly, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10449.864s">Let's</a> call it like it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10451.345s">This</a> isn't a program you wanted to start three months before the people are getting out to make a determination on who the leaders of this community should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10459.81s">And</a> I'm not saying that that had any bearing on this decision whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10464.953s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, it started during a time that it should not have been started. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10471.017s">I</a> think we have to give it at least, at least, another month to see where we go now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10477.041s">I</a> don't even want to say we're out of the <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10480.051s">We're</a> out of the realm of snow because we are in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10483.592s">But</a> now that the snow is thawing, I think we're going to have a better understanding on exactly where the program can be improved, where it cannot be improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10494.075s">We've</a> dealt with a lot of these same issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10495.995s">You</a> look back to some of the bigger issues throughout the community since I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10500.476s">And</a> we had the water meter situation where people weren't letting us in their houses to change the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10506.137s">And</a> you had to take baby steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10508.772s">And</a> ultimately they figured out how to work together and have the person gain access to the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10513.815s">Then</a> it was the recycling bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10516.457s">People</a> were up in arms over the recycling bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10519.118s">It</a> was as if we were telling people, you can't throw any trash away and we're going to start charging you for trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10524.401s">That</a> was ultimately the way we perceived it, and that's how the people felt at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10531.906s">But</a> as you drive around this community on any given trash day now, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10535.46s">Everyone</a> said we're not going to have enough room for trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10537.361s">We're</a> definitely not going to have enough room, and I need seven barrels for my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10541.123s">If</a> you don't have a two-family, you see very few and far between people that have out two trash bins that they're paying an extra fee to have that extra barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10548.707s">Few</a> and far between. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10549.768s">I</a> mean, I challenge anyone to say differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10553.79s">I</a> mean, that's a fact as you drive around our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10556.723s">The</a> other things, other major things over this community that I've been here for the past 16 years, the building of the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10563.768s">There</a> was a lot of animosity, a lot of pushback on it, but over time, over time, people got to like them, and now people are just thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10573.594s">We</a> were talking earlier tonight about possibly using money to put more technology in the schools if the city thinks that there's a better use of that money rather than the public access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10583.908s">So,</a> but I'm just, I'm referring to some of the major, major stumbling blocks that were, you would have thought that the world was coming to an end during some of those issues here in our community because of the complaints and everything else we heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10598.675s">But</a> as a community, everyone worked together and got to the point where they may not have loved the trash program, the new schools, this or that, but at least it was acceptable and tolerated for lack of a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10613.413s">I</a> think we have to be cognizant of the fact that we have to be open and fair to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10620.456s">And</a> at the appropriate time, I have no problem whatsoever taking a vote when I feel the end all be all and they're just totally out of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10629.299s">And</a> let's be honest right now too, if we tried to go after them legally and say we want to suspend the contract and Mark Rumley has to go to Middlesex Superior Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10637.787s">and</a> say it's because they don't have magnets on the back of their truck that say stay back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10641.808s">Don't</a> even spend the $250 filing fee, because we're going to get laughed right out of that courtroom, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10648.09s">And</a> when we hear, when the business owners and stuff, the judges are going to want to hear that, our jury or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10654.172s">They're</a> going to want to know where the city was financially damaged by it and by the things, the citizens are financially damaged because of the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10663.495s">But</a> as of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10664.818s">I</a> just don't think that they're in breach of contract enough where it would stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10668.281s">I'm</a> not an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10669.101s">We</a> have one of the finest city solicitors in the Commonwealth, if not the United States, that works within our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10674.065s">That</a> if and when it comes to that time, him and his assistant city solicitor would be going to bat for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10683.612s">But</a> I just don't think we're there at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10685.854s">I'm</a> starting to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10687.755s">So</a> I'm going to cease my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10691.978s">But</a> I cannot support it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10694.633s">But</a> I am getting closer to be able to take a vote in good faith that the program may not be in the best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10704.644s">But</a> I think people have to realize that it's not as Councilor Caraviello said, we're going to just shell away 800,000, 900,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10712.169s">It</a> would be more that we're acquiring equipment, we're acquiring assets, and then it would be something like Councilor Marks stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10719.014s">You</a> bring in someone for $75,000, $80,000 a year that knows parking management. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10724.238s">I</a> mean, Councilor Marks traversed this whole area with Ronnie DeFranco and the Chief and Gwendolyn Blackburn when they were going to surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10732.765s">There's</a> people that specialize in just this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10735.967s">Just</a> this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10737.328s">Somerville</a> can do it, Cambridge can do it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10741.309s">You</a> know what the difference is? <a

I can say this now because I'm not on the ballot in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10751.111s">The</a> fact of the matter is, Mr. President, you go to Cambridge, you're paying the park to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10757.432s">Or</a> you're paying the park to go into jury duty at the courthouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10760.773s">You're</a> paying the park to actually go to something that you have to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10767.108s">The</a> problem right now we're having is people are paying to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10771.831s">We</a> have to do more as a community to bring in more quality businesses to help sustain these other smaller businesses that are having a hard time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10778.474s">It's</a> not a result of the parking that bestsellers went out of business or Ward's Gift is closing their doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10783.817s">This</a> just started. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10784.538s">It</a> may be a convenient excuse for people to say that that's why the business is a <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10789.015s">We</a> have to do more as a community to bring people in that are going to want to pay the quarter to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10794.278s">We're</a> starting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10795.039s">We've</a> got Carol's Diner in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10797.78s">He's</a> booming on the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10801.722s">We</a> have to do more as a community to bring people to these centers and towns and squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10811.023s">All</a> too often, there's too many storefronts that are vacant, and I haven't really heard much from the mayor on giving tax credits to bring in quality businesses and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10821.366s">Malden,</a> the one business that I think we've did that for was Hof's Bakery. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10827.367s">Hof's</a> Bakery got a break on their tax obligations because they were hiring X amount of people, they were staying here, and what did they just do? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10834.689s">They're</a> moving to Malden because <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10837.685s">Maldon's</a> got an incentive for them to go there, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10839.826s">Whether</a> it's the landlord, whether it's the city, whatever it may be, they're moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10845.17s">This</a> is the stuff that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10847.191s">Medford</a> Square, we've been talking about the Medford Square revitalization for as long as... I was at the Gleason School when they were talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10854.476s">That</a> was probably the first study. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10856.057s">When</a> I was at the Gleason School in 1989, 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10857.137s">This</a> is where we have to get aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10861.847s">We</a> have to get aggressive and make people want to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10864.15s">And</a> this is not being insultive to the businesses that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10870.219s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10872.122s">But</a> I said it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10873.945s">We</a> have to do something with the liquor licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10876.812s">The</a> liquor license, the 99s and the Texas Roadhouses and the rest of them, those are middle of the road places. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10883.273s">They</a> don't even look at Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10884.493s">They</a> don't even look at Medford because you have to have a burger in order to have a beverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10890.955s">And</a> these are the things that we have to do as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10894.375s">And</a> this council has been working towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10900.156s">This</a> evening, we granted a few licenses that hopefully <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10903.43s">Help</a> out the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10905.03s">But</a> this city has to be more forward thinking when it comes to bringing in quality businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10910.451s">You</a> can only talk about station landing for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10913.332s">It's</a> like the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10914.952s">Stations</a> landing was a great improvement to that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10917.812s">But</a> how many years ago was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10921.073s">10,</a> 12 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10923.113s">We</a> have to start looking to do more things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10926.494s">You</a> got Shaw's Supermarket down here, which is an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10930.515s">It</a> was a snow pile for <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10932.624s">For</a> the whole winter, you gotta dodge snowbanks to go to Eastern Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10937.063s">In</a> the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10939.199s">But</a> I'm sorry I'm getting off topic a little bit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10942.081s">But</a> that's where we got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10944.703s">We</a> got to do more as a community on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10946.084s">And</a> that starts at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10947.405s">That</a> starts with the city administration working with his OCD director. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10950.768s">And</a> let's not kid ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10951.929s">I</a> often feel bad for our OCD director. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10954.531s">And</a> I'm going to finish on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10955.812s">I</a> often feel bad on our OCD director when sometimes this council or members of this council or the council in general or people in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10964.756s">may</a> say they don't do a thing or this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10967.338s">That's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10968.458s">They're</a> doing what the person in the corner office is giving them the green light to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10974.141s">Whether</a> it's fair or unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10975.361s">Our</a> OCD director in this community is Michael McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10979.063s">He's</a> our OCD director slash mayor slash traffic enforcement guy slash treasurer collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10984.106s">So</a> anyone that thinks any different, you're sadly mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10988.708s">But</a> that's enough on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10990.889s">But</a> as far as this, I cannot support it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10993.641s">But</a> I think in due time, if it continues this way, Mr. President, I'm sorry for being long-winded, but I think it's a bigger picture we have to focus on than rather just this parking.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11137.659s">Well,</a> Councilor Caraviello's motion is calling to send this to the Committee of the Whole within 14 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11145.325s">As</a> a council, I think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11148.187s">Rather</a> than take the vote this evening, would you respectfully <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11151.678s">Put</a> it aside for 14 days, it's totally your prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11154.819s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11220.413s">Point</a> of information, I was referring to the snow emergency that was in effect.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11227.157s">It</a> was a three-week emergency, unheard of, that's the leadership.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11308.273s">But</a> you may have the votes for it at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11310.654s">Well,</a> maybe at a later date, we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11312.655s">Councilor</a> Knight?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11407.47s">I</a> would ask you, is this in proper form to be voted on at this point, where it's not our jurisdiction? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11414.673s">The</a> mayor is the signatory authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11419.215s">I</a> just asked the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11422.276s">Another</a> paper of this nature was ruled out of order a few weeks ago, and then it was withdrawn by the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11429.899s">So</a> I'm just asking for the consistency.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11451.755s">Motion</a> a table then, until we have that meeting, which is undebatable.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11460.201s">What</a> does that do to the D paper that we have for Councilor Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11463.744s">You</a> can call a meeting at any time and hopefully you respect his wishes within 14 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11475.47s">The</a> President knows what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11477.932s">Fourteen</a> days, have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11480.354s">Call</a> the roll for the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11482.295s">Motion</a> to table.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12038.883s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12039.983s">Thank</a> you, and as we know, $143,000, really, with this stuff, like the Council has stated, isn't going to get us far. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12048.085s">It's</a> going to be very helpful for potholes and things of that nature, but look at Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12052.165s">When</a> they actually ground it down and actually did the job, it's very limited what this is going to get us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12058.927s">I'm</a> glad that this council <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12060.442s">I</a> took a vote last week under the leadership of Councilor Penta, or two weeks ago, to appropriate, or at least ask the Mayor to appropriate a million dollars of the taxpayers' money that's in an account right now, unencumbered. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12073.357s">Very,</a> very important word. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12074.959s">Not</a> encumbered. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12076.732s">It</a> could be used for any purpose with a vote of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12080.896s">So</a> the $143,000 is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12082.938s">But</a> if the mayor puts $1.143 million on the table to do this community, you're going to see that get us some places. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12090.305s">So</a> once again, this council is bringing forward good ideas as far as I'm concerned.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12474.421s">Move</a> approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12476.214s">They</a> were going to do it themselves, but it's nasty, so they don't want to touch it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12486.48s">One</a> more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12488.141s">City</a> Hall really is, if I may, falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12491.923s">We</a> had this beautiful event here Sunday with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12496.405s">And</a> when the gentlemen that were here walked into the second floor men's room, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12501.594s">That</a> bathroom has been covered with caution tape, the urinal, for about two and a half months. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12508.237s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12509.017s">If</a> it's beyond repair, if it's beyond repair, take it out, cap off the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12517.061s">This</a> is a basic plumbing job.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12520.202s">Very</a> basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12520.803s">We</a> can get someone at Minuteman, Volk could come up here and do that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12528.253s">I'm</a> speechless. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12529.094s">I'm</a> speechless for once. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12531.235s">You</a> would think that you'd want to get the building ready for those type of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12536.039s">I</a> mean, I understand not every office in this city hall has their own private bathroom in it, like the mayor's office, but for us little people that have to use the public restroom, it's disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12549.229s">If</a> we can get that fixed.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12763.433s">But</a> my question is, I think it's fairly simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12767.515s">I</a> think I got a good understanding of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12771.757s">Was</a> there a roll call vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12772.637s">If</a> there wasn't a roll call vote, you could have... There was a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12774.658s">There</a> was a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12777.9s">I</a> know exactly what I said.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12816.862s">Does</a> the MMA, on the particular issue you guys are talking about, whatever it is, does the MMA have an official position on it?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12855.264s">That's</a> the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12857.654s">Why</a> is this hooky? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12858.735s">It's</a> not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12859.515s">I</a> didn't make a big deal that he did.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12943.348s">There's</a> a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12946.87s">How</a> do you present the records? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12947.791s">That's</a> my question.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA/2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA.html">Medford City Council - March 17, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=47.475s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=49.636s">The</a> past couple of years, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=53.7s">There</a> has been an increase of substance abuse overdoses and other issues throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=60.502s">I'd</a> like to have the city solicitor draft an ordinance, putting it into the personnel ordinance section of our local ordinances so that come budget time or come time to do the community development block grant funding, which is going to be in the next month or so, I'm sure we'll be having our portion, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=84.0s">that</a> there's an actual ordinance in place, and if the mayor doesn't see fit to sign off on this ordinance, as we all know, a two-thirds vote of this council would be able to override it anyway, if it's something that we all seem serious about, which I'm sure we are based upon the talk around here for the last few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=103.806s">So</a> I'd like to actually make this an ordinance, and if the mayor signs it, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=107.632s">I'm</a> sure he will take a hard look at it and if he sees it, that it's a good expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=113.214s">The</a> language that I got for this is based upon the language of all the different surrounding communities that do have a part-time coordinator in their area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=123.078s">Most</a> of the cities I looked at had a minimum of 20 hours per week, but I figured where we have the long day Wednesday, if you could have someone here three days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=131.661s">And</a> as far as the experience, that would be up to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=136.01s">But</a> I just think you need someone that really has experience in the field, and it has to be an appointment that's made with due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=143.253s">But</a> that's certainly up to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=145.134s">So</a> I'd like to do this by way of ordinance, so that if the mayor doesn't see fit to do it, he can leave it unfunded in his budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=151.878s">But</a> that will tell us where he really stands on the issue, if there is an ordinance change in the personnel charts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=158.366s">And</a> this is a great starting point for our discussions tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=162.768s">If</a> we want to, I'd like to get the ball rolling with budgets coming up for the ordinance change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=167.63s">But</a> if people want to talk about this further tomorrow night, I would refer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=171.611s">But</a> if people want to vote on this this evening, we can do it this evening too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=175.313s">But</a> I would say time is of the essence, just where budget's starting to roll around and community development block grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=181.135s">But</a> certainly by putting it off one night for further discussion, I'm not opposed to that at all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=201.568s">Boston's</a> doing something right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=204.411s">Bill</a> Ricka has one in place, as well as Woburn is talking about it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=210.336s">And</a> if you follow the Northwest Weekly, it's something in the Boston Globe on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=214.12s">It's</a> something that most, I shouldn't say most, that would be speaking out of turn, but a lot of the cities and towns around here are doing similar things, but Billerica really is the leading one around here, and that's former Mayor John Curran out of Woburn, who's in the process, if not, they either just hired the person, or are in the process of hiring them right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=623.594s">Thank</a> you very much to all my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=626.155s">I</a> think it's great to send this to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=628.375s">Just</a> a couple of points that I'd just like to add to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=631.476s">This</a> isn't specific to the large opiate addiction that we currently have in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=637.677s">This</a> is also for treatment, people that may be suffering from using other substances that may be drugs, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=645.02s">So</a> it's more of a substance abuse coordinator for all substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=650.164s">That's</a> the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=651.404s">The</a> second thing is, the mayor always saw fit that it was a very important position in our community when his friend Mr. Averbrook had the job of Medford Saving Lives director. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=660.551s">Unfortunately,</a> due to the untiming passing of Ben, who was very well respected in this community, that job has not been filled in some years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=669.957s">This</a> may be an opportunity where the person that does this job can also encompass <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=674.71s">the</a> Medford Saving Lives program, which has been left unfilled by the mayor for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=682.492s">And</a> then last but not least, one thing that I know that is a huge thing when it comes to substance abuse, it's the beds out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=689.014s">It's</a> for treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=690.254s">We</a> all know Long Island just closed due to the bridge situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=694.935s">Mayor</a> Walsh had to take that out of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=697.756s">But</a> the biggest thing, I think, if this comes forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=701.775s">Well,</a> not the biggest thing, because it's a unified approach with all the different areas, treatment, education, prevention, and intervention services, but an open dialogue between the community and the area hospitals to find out what resources are available on a given day, because all too often, someone's ready to make that step to go into a detox center or a hospital, and unless they're dual diagnosis with a psychiatric problem as well as a substance abuse problem, they just aren't the beds out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=730.95s">exact</a> right time where they say, oh yes, come on over to McLean Hospital, come on over here, come to Whittier Pavilion, whatever hospital it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=738.915s">But</a> an ongoing dialogue between the local hospitals and the city so that you know and you have a count of what resources are available at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=748.921s">The</a> second thing is the continuum of care right now at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and Hallmark Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=755.065s">They're</a> doing a pilot program right now under a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=757.827s">I'm</a> sure most of us are aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=760.05s">where</a> they're actually, they're focusing on back pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=762.611s">When</a> someone comes in with back pain, and back pain is one of those things that you really can't diagnose, but when someone comes in and they're in severe pain, they're in severe pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=772.256s">But</a> Hallmark's approach in their continuum of care at this point, and they're studying it in a trial moving forward, they're given a maximum of three days worth of painkillers, and then they have to follow up with their primary care or a specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=787.744s">So</a> Hallmark Health is definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=790.178s">in</a> the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=791.299s">I</a> think we're going to hear a little bit more from Middlesex District Attorney Marion Ryan soon on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=797.644s">I</a> can't speak for her, but I think that she's acknowledged that this is a huge problem in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=804.289s">And</a> I think they'll be focused around here a little bit in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=811.874s">And</a> the other thing is too, and I'll discuss this tomorrow night, the Narcan, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=817.327s">which</a> we all know is the substance for, it's actually for opiates. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=821.93s">But</a> I think that's something that we should work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=826.193s">Whatever</a> it may be, if it's through contract negotiations, whether it's through, whatever the avenues are, we should look to make sure that our professionals have access to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=835.44s">And</a> if it means contract negotiations and doing it, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=841.804s">But</a> this is all stuff we can talk about tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=845.097s">But</a> I just want to reiterate, I thank my council colleagues for taking this very, very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=849.94s">I</a> think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=852.081s">We</a> realize that alcohol and other substances is a part of this community, that we want to be there and help people out when they've surrendered to this awful disease.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1065.517s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1066.497s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1067.197s">Can</a> we also ask the same question if Councilor Penta's okay to ask the DA's office and the state police? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1071.858s">Because</a> we have a lot of areas in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1073.962s">that</a> are patrolled by the state police, and I know we have had overdoses up at Mystic Lakes, up at the Sheepfold, and different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1079.845s">So</a> that may be additional numbers that we're not necessarily looking at, because they don't necessarily all the time call EMS, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1089.531s">People</a> refuse it, then they get arrested. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1092.573s">As</a> amended by Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1150.802s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1152.643s">The</a> last few <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1154.209s">months,</a> last weeks, we've been focused on other areas that we just discussed and other things that have been important in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1160.851s">I</a> think long overdue, the city actually having a mentoring program where you can work with Rotary, Kiwanis, private business, city hall employees, city employees, just regular volunteers, people that are willing to spend some time and be a mentor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1180.155s">As</a> we all know, there's a lot of broken families in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1183.104s">People</a> coming from single parent families, kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1186.205s">And</a> if we can start with kids that are about seven, eight years old and mentor them right through. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1191.287s">I</a> know Boston has a program that Mayor Walsh just initiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1194.908s">And</a> I believe he's looking for 1,000 mentors with a big handful of them being Boston City employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1200.85s">But</a> if we can do it on a smaller scale in Medford, maybe start with 50 people, I think that that's a goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1207.272s">But</a> it's up to the mayor to put this in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1209.846s">And</a> I don't see any reason why we can't with the size of our city and the committed people we have throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1216.389s">The</a> mayor made phone calls asking people for donations just last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1220.571s">Maybe</a> he can pick up the phone and call the same people and see if they're interested in getting a mentoring program off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1226.613s">And</a> I, as one member of the city council, and I'm sure all of us are, would be more than willing to help him any way we can.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1665.098s">No,</a> not for now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2521.49s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2523.871s">I</a> would just, as we're looking at this, I think we have to be very realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2529.015s">We</a> heard it loud and clear over the past five years, people wanted Verizon, people wanted the opportunity to go out and choose which cable provider that they would like to subscribe to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2539.781s">And</a> so, I actually support the renewal of the contract, just based upon giving people the opportunity to make a <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2549.458s">on</a> what provider they would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2551.018s">I</a> don't see any reason why, though, they can't open this up at this point to other vendors that may be interested and not just exclusively Verizon and Comcast or Xfinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2562.22s">But</a> like I said, this is something this city council called for for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2567.121s">Competition,</a> competition, competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2569.541s">And</a> if this doesn't get renewed, I would think that competition is now by the wayside in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2577.003s">I</a> don't know that to be 100% true, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2578.902s">It</a> sort of makes sense just based upon the contract not being renewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2582.824s">At</a> some point, Comcast would no longer be available to be subscribed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2589.768s">So,</a> I just think we've got to think about that because we were very adamant. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2594.891s">Councilor</a> Marks, do you remember how many years it was? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2596.932s">Councilor</a> Carr was on the Council when we were trying to get Verizon in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2601.074s">It's</a> been that long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2603.315s">So,</a> competition is good for the consumer.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2814.334s">Yes,</a> I'd also like Director Burke, if I can make a motion, to provide us with the last four consecutive fiscal years of franchise fees that came into this community as a result of a 1987 vote or 88 vote of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2828.945s">There's</a> nothing that says we have to keep that in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2832.748s">Members</a> of this Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2834.821s">if</a> we wanted to can do away with the franchise fee on the monthly bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2838.104s">Now</a> we have to be obvious, we obviously have to be aware that there are many good programs that are funded through it, teachers in the school system and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2847.935s">But</a> I'd like to see four years worth of franchise fees and then we can take a serious look at if it's something that we want to continue as a practice here in the city of Medford.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2897.37s">And</a> I think this is this is playing into the whole picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2899.352s">We</a> asked for the transfers last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2901.213s">We're</a> actually holding in on the budget now to see where there could be some savings, where in the past we haven't asked for some of this empirical data. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2909.299s">Thank</a> you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2910.24s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3751.44s">The</a> peg access is what pays for the school committee and the city council as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3757.185s">And</a> we all know as we traverse this community, how many people watch these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3761.108s">And</a> a portion of it is funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3763.492s">And</a> so once again, I think Councilor Alango-Kern has a great idea, seeing exactly how much of it is paying for Monday nights and Tuesday nights and how much is getting paid elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3774.176s">But</a> TV3 or whatever the public access station is one portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3780.278s">The</a> PEG stands for public education and government. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3783.139s">We</a> still have a government channel and we have an education component. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3786.66s">Right</a> now, the P for public access is missing, but there still is two other channels that are funded through that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4057.999s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4059.861s">I</a> can see where this is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4060.922s">I</a> would anticipate that the mayor is going to say that where this is a renewal, he doesn't need the Medford City Council, as Councilor Caraviello pointed out in his wise wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4072.993s">He</a> doesn't need the City Council to give him the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4076.253s">So,</a> I think at this point, we should go and temporarily, for the next 60 days, rescind the original vote that was taken under, I believe it had to be under City Manager Galoni at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4089.221s">Because</a> this is technically a renewal, it's not a new contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4092.263s">So,</a> if we rescind the original vote where the council gave approval... No, no, but it's been a renewal, a renewal, a renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4101.808s">The</a> original vote that gave the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4105.182s">the</a> green light to move forward of a plus three year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4109.944s">I</a> think this city council should take a vote to temporarily rescind it so that he cannot go and sign this tomorrow morning while we're waiting for the city clerk to do his due diligence and pull the original paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4121.689s">Does</a> it make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4123.93s">Because</a> this is a renewal and the administration is going to come back and say, I don't need your consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4128.492s">You</a> gave it to me on the original contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4132.786s">Do</a> you see what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4134.387s">Where</a> if that vote's rescinded, he can only negotiate a maximum of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4139.25s">And</a> it, it sounds to me by listening to the council colleague, my council colleagues, no one's really comfortable with a 10-year deal at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4147.515s">So</a> then.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4149.036s">Are</a> we authorized to rescind something that old? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4151.797s">We</a> can rescind anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4152.778s">Cause</a> he's, he, whatever vote he's banking on saying that he has the authority to do it, that should be rescinded by this council temporarily for 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4161.733s">until</a> we find out where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4164.515s">So,</a> is that in the form of a motion, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4167.277s">That</a> is in the form of a motion.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4169.338s">So,</a> on the motion... Well, at least until... At least rescind it until April 15th, is it?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4181.907s">The</a> only thing we can rescind is the original vote giving him the authority to go over three-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4190.066s">But</a> I agree with that, but I'm afraid tomorrow morning he'll sign this contract knowing that the council's looking for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4201.233s">Well,</a> if he thinks he can't get his 10-year deal... Can we rescind it for seven days? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4213.982s">Rescind</a> it for seven days? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4215.423s">Will</a> you support rescinding it for seven days? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4219.277s">the</a> original authority for the mayor to negotiate over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4223.98s">But</a> Ed Finn just told me it's still in effect.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4361.595s">The</a> council council president, mr. Councilor Camuso has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4366.357s">I'm</a> going to, uh, I'm going to withdraw that original motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4368.999s">I'm</a> going to make a motion that the city solicitor advises this council on the original paper and respectfully ask the mayor not to sign the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4377.078s">until</a> the city solicitor's opinion is back before the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4380.399s">And</a> if he goes forward and signs it, full well knowing that the council at this point, just speaking, and I'm not so sure if I'm far against the 10-year contract, but it sounds like several members are, are not far going out, but at least if he signs it between now and then, where we had since December 18th to now, and we're asking for seven days, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4401.898s">I</a> think that would be unfair for him to do that at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4412.285s">On,</a> on the, to, um, and the city clerk to furnish this council with the original vote that gave the mayor the authority not to negotiate with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4423.652s">Well,</a> it could be Comcast or the authority to negotiation with a cable service provider for over 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4429.996s">And</a> it has to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4431.44s">broader</a> for all cable companies, because the mayor did not need a vote of the city council to give a 10-year contract to Verizon.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6259.648s">Can</a> we also ask that the city administration to provide with this data <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6263.767s">the</a> amount of snow emergency days that were called since this program started? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6270.431s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6270.531s">Because</a> those particular days, there was no parking on the main streets, legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6276.754s">But</a> we have a snow emergency like no other community that I've ever seen where you just keep it on and on and on with no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6283.157s">But</a> if we could just ask that question.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg/2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg.html">Medford City Council - March 10, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=674.845s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=676.126s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=678.688s">Unfortunately,</a> I'm a little bit saddened that the administration didn't pursue participating in the survey, which may have told the state what our needs were. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=687.433s">And</a> sometimes the state uses this type of data when it comes to funding purposes for cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=694.698s">But</a> with that being said, I'm not surprised that he just let it sit on a disc or go on a shredder or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=701.174s">With</a> that being said, I do support this this evening, and I'm not gonna tell Councilor Penta what to do, but I'd like to make that, if you make the motion, I'd support it, the million dollars out of certified free cash to repair the roadways throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=715.24s">So</a> you're gonna bring that up? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=716.48s">You</a> wanna do that now? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=717.521s">And</a> I'd second that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=726.724s">To</a> repair the roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=728.895s">And</a> last but not least, as I said earlier, I'd just like to commend the councilor as well as Councilor Lungo-Koehn for being forward thinking with the 311 system that she brought up a little while ago that this council supported because these are tools that the administration could use if they wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=749.741s">But</a> we're talking about an administration that doesn't have a fire department that has email throughout the entire department, picks and chooses who has it, as well as an administration that doesn't have voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=759.115s">So,</a> certainly, I'm not that surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=761.816s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1423.058s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1425.119s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1426.86s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1428.421s">The</a> mayor has a wonderful asset, too, in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1431.003s">We</a> all know Stephanie Muccini-Burke, who was a stalwart as a councilor, and she was all about accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1437.135s">And</a> if the mayor can't figure this out, he can just reach across his office and maybe ask her to bring some of her leadership thoughts forward on this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1445.337s">Because</a> as I said, we all know that she was all about holding people accountable when she was a city councillor, and she brings so much to that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1454.64s">So</a> if he can't figure it out, maybe he can get some of his staff to maybe look into the 311 or some type of similar product that may be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1465.984s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1467.518s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1684.464s">This</a> includes the million dollars
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1796.634s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1798.094s">While</a> we're under suspension, I'd like to, if my council colleagues don't mind, I think a report of all the transfers internally that have taken place from July 1st up to say February, the end of February, would give us a good idea on where the mayor's transferring money within the budget and will prepare us to start looking at next year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1820.158s">But</a> as we know, the only transfers that need to come before the council, if it's for a totally <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1825.929s">different</a> line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1827.369s">So</a> there's so many transfers that take place on a daily if not weekly basis within the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1834.231s">I</a> think we should have a good picture because we know that there's positions within the budget right now that have been funded that still have no one in the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1842.052s">DPW</a> director is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1844.233s">It's</a> over $100,000 a year job and the individual is being paid three days a week because it's a part-time so-called contract employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1853.615s">It's</a> a retiree. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1854.867s">that's</a> currently doing the job rather than the, um, so, so I'd like to see where that money for that salary has went. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1862.832s">So,</a> uh, if we could ask the administration by the way of a resolve to provide us with all transfers that have taken place amongst, um, all the departments internally, and most of this will be the DPW, we'll be doing it from one line item to another line item that may have went to the overtime line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1880.223s">But</a> I think it's incumbent upon us to look at that as we get ready to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1883.439s">to</a> come into budget time so we can actually have a realistic look on where the mayor is moving the money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1889.481s">So</a> I'd like to get a roll call vote on that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1932.703s">And</a> if we could also ask for the other report that we get, where exactly we are financially six months plus into the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1940.089s">We</a> used to get a report every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1941.57s">We</a> haven't been seeing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1943.112s">So</a> I just think we need a clear picture to realize how much money is being moved around. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1947.422s">internally,</a> because there may be areas that the mayor may want to add a line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1951.343s">Hey,</a> instead of moving the money around every year, maybe I want to do this or do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1955.084s">And</a> realistically, that's when we can look at it and see if we think there should be a reduction in the line item, an addition in the line item, because we're not seeing those transfers that take place during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1966.047s">The</a> only transfers we technically usually see are the major ones that come to us June 20th, June 26th for moving major money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1974.349s">But</a> for instance, the police <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1977.56s">overtime</a> budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1978.601s">I'm</a> sure that that's close to in the arrears, if not in the arrears, and they have to fund it some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1984.046s">So</a> there's another line item somewhere within the budget that they would allocate money from. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1988.089s">So</a> I think this would be a very good tool for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1990.711s">And</a> then we may want to ask for this again in like three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1994.074s">But</a> I'd like to put the last day of February as a date because those are transfers that have already taken place and we can actually see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2002.161s">And</a> then maybe at the end of this month we'll ask for another one and another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2006.117s">because</a> I'm sure there's areas within the budget that are underfunded or overfunded that funds are being allocated from different line items.

<a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2897.648s">People</a> are using just to numb their feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2900.649s">And</a> that's why, in recovery, they say, if you're an alcoholic, don't pick up the marijuana, or pick up this, or do that, or do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2906.593s">Or</a> if you're an intravenous drug user and you stop doing that, don't pick up the Budweiser, because you're just substituting your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2916.398s">These</a> are the things no one wants to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2918.739s">But</a> I got nine, 10 months left on this city council before I retire. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2922.605s">And</a> this is something that I'm going to follow through on and make it my mission to have the city step up, have the city put funding behind this, not just press conferences, but actual places that families and substance abuse users can go to when they're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2937.902s">Because</a> no one's kidding anyone, until you are ready, until you are ready and surrender, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2944.823s">You</a> can have anything in front of you, and all these families out here can relate, anything at all in front of you, and you're gonna choose the booze, the heroin, the pills, whatever it may be, you're gonna choose that, because ultimately it takes control of your life, takes control of your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2962.793s">And</a> I wouldn't have believed this until I confronted my disease, because it's awful easy to look outside and throw glasses and use the word junkie or a drunk, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2974.087s">I</a> wrote my wife a nice letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2975.908s">You</a> know what I always thought the alcoholic was, the drunk? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2978.35s">The</a> guy at Harvard Square sitting there with a brown paper bag, with a brown paper bag, drinking and collecting cans to go and buy the next bottle of booze. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2987.196s">I</a> didn't think it was someone that was a city councilor for 16 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2990.378s">I</a> didn't think it was someone that worked for the Sheriff's Department for 18 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2995.161s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2996.622s">It</a> doesn't discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2998.725s">does</a> not discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2999.685s">We</a> have members of this community that are suffering so much that end up killing themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3004.747s">Killing</a> themselves because they're in so much pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3007.788s">Pick</a> up the obituaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3009.089s">Not</a> everyone says alcoholism or drug abuse or this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3014.371s">But</a> we know people that have committed suicide and were struggling with this very disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3018.292s">And</a> they took that route rather than letting everyone else down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3022.814s">Because</a> when you're in a state <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3024.318s">and</a> you feel like your disease got you by the grip, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3030.583s">You'd</a> rather be dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3032.465s">You'd</a> rather be dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3033.766s">And</a> I'm speaking from experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3035.908s">So</a> we have to do something as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3040.012s">We</a> have to actually get out there and fund some programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3043.855s">Because</a> like I said, when the substance abuse users are ready, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3049.127s">We</a> have to be there to meet them with open arms and give them guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3051.889s">Right</a> now, the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, the 12th step is giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3056.251s">It's</a> giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3057.652s">I'm</a> working with other people, other people that are alcoholics, to try to give them hope, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3067.158s">And</a> I just hope, I just hope that the city administration takes a long look at this and look that since 2003, 2003, in this community, people were overdosing, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3078.84s">on</a> heroin, overdosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3081.101s">A</a> baseball player for the Florida Marlins overdosed within the seven and a half miles of this community several times, several times. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3089.266s">And</a> that was in 2000, early 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3091.007s">And</a> here we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3093.709s">So,</a> uh, like I said, let's actually put our money where our mouths are and fund this something. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3102.534s">And</a> I know councilor Dello Russo called me today cause he knows I've been on his back about calling a committee of the whole meeting on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3108.807s">And</a> I don't know if you chose the date yet, but I thank you for being very active on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3128.503s">And</a> that's what I hope.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7048.212s">Councilor</a> Penta, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7051.133s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7052.093s">And,</a> uh, I do support the main resolution and then Councilor Knight's, uh, amendment as well as, um, Councilor Penta's. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7060.234s">Yeah,</a> I know we're getting to the point where it's, um, we're getting some time under our belt with this new program, but we still really don't have good data. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7071.836s">As</a> the councilor mentioned, we've been on a snow emergency now for a couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7077.395s">You</a> know, people aren't parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7079.175s">Once</a> the snow's away, we can really look into making major changes to this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7084.956s">But</a> at this point, I don't see anything wrong with revisiting the 15 and 30 minutes free parking or something in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7092.878s">And</a> if they have to do it at the end of the parking, if that's the only way that the system in place will work, then it's something they should look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7102.779s">But</a> I just don't know how you're going to enforce the 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7106.68s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7107.697s">This</a> is what you get paid for here at City Hall to figure it out, and I support the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7112.478s">And</a> make it work for the people.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8218.352s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8220.293s">As</a> we all know, state rep Donato has done a great job delivering for the community here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8225.276s">And</a> once again, he has been appointed a higher position. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8230.799s">It</a> seems like every two years, representative Donato has been moving through the ranks. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8235.301s">So</a> he just <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8237.36s">We've</a> got one more promotion in the ranks of leadership, and for that I want to congratulate him. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8241.683s">And</a> hopefully this will allow him to bring more funding to Medford for all the projects that are so important to the quality of life here in our community.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8314.517s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8315.397s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8316.498s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8317.39s">I</a> think this is something we should also have Bill Timmons get involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8321.693s">This</a> is actually a part of his job he should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8324.596s">So</a> if maybe we could get him there for, um, for this very important meeting, uh, I'd like to make sure he's part of this cause we all know, uh, he can issue fines as well as he's the person that certifies the meters every April. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8338.947s">Uh,</a> so he's a front and center and more importantly, he's had dealings with all these, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8344.984s">companies</a> and licenses, so we want to get some input from him on the way they're doing their business and if he feels that they're a reputable business to continue within the confines of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8358.852s">Thank</a> you for a good council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8360.033s">Councilor</a> Knight.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_7XOxP2SN444/2025-03-21_7XOxP2SN444.html">Medford City Council - February 3, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1730.807s">Councilor</a> Camuso, I'm glad you're feeling well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1732.848s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1733.248s">I'd</a> just like to say I'm glad I came down this evening with 101 temperature, but with the wisecrack that Councilor Penta wanted to say about me being sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1742.813s">So</a> I just wanted to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1744.714s">You</a> weren't sure when I was coming back and all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1748.516s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1750.903s">Yes,</a> there was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1752.163s">We'll</a> put the paper on hold for Councilor Caraviello, but we don't know when Councilor Camuso's coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1758.585s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1761.366s">You're</a> just such a wonderful person. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1765.767s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2062.247s">I</a> don't know about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2064.408s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2065.446s">I'd</a> just like to congratulate the Lieutenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2066.987s">You</a> know, he's not only well respected in our community, like the Chief said, but throughout this whole area, whether it's the NMLAC unit, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office, just very, very well respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2080.256s">And</a> I'm very, very happy to see him moving on, but at the same time, sad because he's such an instrumental part of our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2090.143s">I'd</a> also just like to ask the Chief, I don't want to make it a B paper because this is all about Mike, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2094.633s">But</a> Chief, do you anticipate to fill the void with him? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2098.715s">Because</a> I know we're down to bare bones with patrol officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2102.577s">I</a> want to make sure that there is a corral ladder and that the job is filled.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2531.91s">Yes,</a> what the attorney didn't say is that this is not the Attorney General's office right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2540.098s">This</a> was a decision of the Suffolk Superior Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2543.499s">The</a> 48-page document that Councilor Penta refers to is a ruling of the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2549.44s">So</a> I think we should actually get that ruling first, have our city solicitor go over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2555.322s">And</a> quite honestly, in the press release from the Attorney General's office, it appeared that there might be some conversations going forward that Hallmark Health may be able to work out an arrangement, possibly, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2569.94s">if</a> it's set aside from the three hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2573.442s">So</a> I just think it's very, we have to be very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2577.483s">The</a> Attorney General had made a comment, but her comments were prior to the decision of the Suffolk Superior Court Judge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2584.266s">So</a> if we could get that and send it to our legal counsel to look over, because as Councilor Caraviello stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2590.363s">This</a> is something that's going to have a long-term detrimental effect on our community if that place was to shut down due to a merger not taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2599.628s">And</a> that's jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2600.869s">That's</a> a major piece of land in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2604.591s">So</a> we have to be ahead of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2607.433s">And</a> if Hallmark Health, if Lawrence Memorial has to start negotiations with Beth Israel or someone else, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2614.817s">But</a> we all know that the Leahy <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2616.931s">merged</a> with Winchester most recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2619.192s">So</a> I think we have to worry about Lawrence Memorial Hospital and not so much the Hallmark Health on the South Shore, because the people in Melrose right now aren't concerned about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2629.975s">So</a> we have to urge Hallmark Health to look at any and all avenues to keep a hospital afloat here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2638.017s">And</a> as I said, whether it's Beth Israel, whether it's Tufts Medical Center, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2644.269s">And</a> the Brigham and Women's, as we know, has the affiliation with the South Shore Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2648.291s">The</a> Mass General, which is the other part of Partners, was doing the affiliation out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2653.534s">And</a> in their political structure, the Mass General is sort of the king, has a little bit more at the table, I would say, in the boardroom than the Brigham and Women's does. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2664.659s">So</a> we got to just make sure that Lawrence Memorial Hospital is looked at, excuse me, by Hallmark Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2673.412s">for</a> any and all options that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2676.113s">I</a> think, as a community, we can't just say that we back that merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2680.655s">We</a> have to see what other opportunities there are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2684.557s">So</a> I'd like to get the city solicitor to look at the opinion and then ask Hallmark Health specifically if they have any plans for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2694.26s">Because</a> quite honestly, I'm not concerned about Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2696.881s">I'm</a> not concerned about <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2699.007s">uh,</a> South shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2699.887s">And</a> when you look at the elected officials that supported this merger and some that didn't, it appears it was all upon where programs were going within the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2709.972s">The</a> senators out of Lynn were against the merger because it would have affected the Lynn facility would have got programs that they may not have wanted that would have been moved from Melrose Wakefield and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2721.918s">So</a> I think we have to look at the piece of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and not Hallmark Health as a whole.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3853.104s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3853.444s">If</a> I may, we like to move suspension of the rules before a gentleman that would like to address this honorable body.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4646.019s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4647.4s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4648.581s">And,</a> uh, Steven was also a great personal friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4651.422s">Uh,</a> just a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4653.103s">And,</a> uh, as we all know, his family goes back, uh, 50 years of public service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4657.517s">whether</a> it was his dad, Frank, working for the Sheriff's Department back as a superintendent in the 1980s and the 70s, his mom, Roberta, who still works here part-time and does a fabulous job, his brother, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4670.005s">He's</a> also with the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4673.027s">Just</a> a great, great, great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4675.609s">And</a> Stephen will be sorely missed around the baseball field and just around the community in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4680.813s">Just</a> always had a smile on his face, outstanding personality, and just a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4688.418s">want</a> to send my condolences as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4733.585s">If</a> I may, many of us that enjoyed the Park League when we were kids as Councilor Lungo was champion for it for many, many years, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4740.978s">When</a> we were kids, the director, well, I'm a couple years older than Counsel Lungo, but the director when I was a kid growing up was Mr. Salido. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4749.886s">Just</a> a great guy, and then I'd often spend time with him after, later in life, I'd be visiting my dad's grave up at Oak Grove Cemetery, and Mrs. Salido was right across the way in the little island there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4764.339s">And</a> he was always, always up there, as we all know, just a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4768.041s">and</a> another dedicated public servant here in our community that will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4772.522s">Mrs.</a> Irwin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4773.462s">We</a> all know Honorable Justice Irwin that passed away a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4778.683s">Another</a> outstanding family here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4782.124s">Ann</a> Marie Callahan is still here in Medford with her loving husband, Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4786.945s">And</a> just a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4788.545s">And</a> she passed away this past week as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4792.446s">So</a> if we could just keep them in our thoughts and prayers and send them a condolence on behalf of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4797.678s">If</a> we could all stand for a moment of silence for all these people near and dear to Medford.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4914.075s">Councilor</a> Penta, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4916.957s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4918.898s">If</a> I just very briefly on this, I'm actually glad to see this development taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4926.682s">And</a> the reason I say that is we have to make sure that the Medford's neighborhood is protected, but that hospital has always concerned me of a not so good development or facility taking place up there because it's actually in a Medford residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4940.615s">practically</a> more than Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4942.435s">And</a> to echo some of my sentiments from earlier when we were talking about the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and potentially having a vacant piece of property and something not so nice for a neighbourhood to come in, and by speaking with this gentleman for the past six months or so, the developer, in meeting with neighbours, I really believe that they're committed to making sure that this is done in a way that it's respectful of the Medford neighbourhood <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4968.999s">I</a> know Councilor Marks put a paper on before, I believe it was you Councilor Marks, correct me if I'm wrong, to install some sort of a structure up there so it will not be a cut through. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4979.528s">So</a> this council has been proactive on this since it first started, but I also very much respect the development and where they do have to go in front of Malden before coming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4990.638s">It</a> would be similar to us doing a development and the developer goes to Somerville before he has <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4997.433s">has</a> the time to come before the Medford City Council or the Medford Zoning Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5001.035s">So</a> if the zoning and stuff isn't approved over there, then this is going nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5005.077s">And</a> it's basically moot on the Medford portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5008.099s">And</a> just for the viewing public, I know the neighbors were very concerned, and there's a great group of neighbors right up there on Lund Road and that whole surrounding area, that they legally have to be notified of any zoning changes <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5021.793s">even</a> if it's across city lines, if they're within the boundaries of what's called for by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5027.836s">I</a> specifically checked that out during a neighborhood meeting up there with our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5032.159s">So</a> anyone that thinks that the zoning laws don't apply because it's on the other side of the town or city border, that is incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5039.203s">And</a> so we will have a seat at the table at the appropriate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5044.325s">And</a> Council President Dello Russo, I know you've been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5047.726s">very</a> hot as well as I was when I was sitting in your seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5052.929s">So,</a> look forward to upcoming meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5056.151s">And</a> thank you for keeping us abreast and getting the developer at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5058.812s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5626.471s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5631.354s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5632.494s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5633.935s">I</a> dealt with this, with the family that the tower's in front of, and this was several years ago when they bought the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5642.439s">They</a> moved out here from the north end of Boston to <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5646.426s">held</a> circle in particular, and I don't believe that's a regular cell tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5652.548s">I</a> think it may have something to do with mass port communications in Logan Airport, but certainly that has been there for the last 20 or 30 years from when we originally looked into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5664.011s">So</a> I agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn to at least get an update, but unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5670.027s">It</a> was something that's been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5671.167s">I</a> think it might have been there prior to the development of some of the houses up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5674.249s">Because</a> I know there would have been huge public outcry at the time to put that inside a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5682.312s">We</a> dealt with it with some of the billboards getting switched out down on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5690.735s">And</a> that's stuff that you have to be cognizant of the fact when you buy your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5694.256s">And</a> I actually said that to the person in the family that I was dealing with at the time that moved out here from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5700.445s">You</a> can't buy your house next to a park and then say, hey, get rid of the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5704.807s">I</a> know I used to have that argument with my grandmother at Century Street all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5707.568s">Now</a> my cousin Joey loves having the park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5711.689s">So</a> if we could get those answers, though, it would at least alleviate some of the questions and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5716.531s">And</a> there's no reason, like Councilor Lungo-Koehn said, the building department should be issuing permits for when they're doing work on it, no matter who it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5722.953s">And</a> there also should be emergency contact information on the fence that goes around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5726.694s">Similar</a> to the National Grid, you drive through Burlington, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5728.978s">And</a> they have those huge towers that are delivering electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5733.2s">And</a> they all say, in case of emergency, call this phone number, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5737.463s">That's</a> important for after-hours emergencies and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5741.164s">So</a> I support this 100%.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5781.946s">If</a> I remember correctly, that was what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5785.323s">One</a> person was the owner, and maybe Massport had some equipment on it, and Verizon, and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5789.906s">So</a> that's a good question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7989.38s">Next</a> in queue is Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7991.562s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7992.863s">And</a> before we go any further, I think we have to urge the mayor that from now on, on Tuesday nights, at least until April, to turn the heat on in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8003.552s">Because</a> I was afraid that it was because I'm under the weather, but I've talked to several people in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8010.077s">It's</a> absolutely freezing in here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8011.918s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn tells me it's 63 degrees in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8014.3s">So</a> next week, we're going to have to bring our scarves and our winter hat to do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8019.372s">But</a> with that being said, two things that I'd be interested to get an update on the current situation is one, a usage report they gave us a few weeks ago, which was good data, told us people seem to be participating within the confines of the laws and restrictions that are put in place by the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8039.865s">And</a> the second thing is I'd like to get an update, Chief, on the tokens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8044.228s">Jimmy's</a> Pizza here, great in the community, as he says. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8048.377s">People</a> come in, they have to wait because he has a line out the door because he's given a good product. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8052.14s">And</a> people go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8055.022s">Look</a> at all the names on the petitions he gives us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8057.384s">Every</a> single one of those people have been in there buying a sandwich. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8060.647s">So</a> keep up the good work, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8063.67s">With</a> that being said, though, I would like to have the tokens in place where Jimmy, as a businessman, could purchase the tokens instead of a quarter, $0.15 maybe for the tokens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8075.079s">And</a> these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8077.264s">Um,</a> I know you're working on it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8096.908s">And</a> it was a very doable plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8098.788s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8099.248s">And</a> with that being said, um, that was my next question was, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8103.07s">if</a> and when this will be instituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8105.471s">Because</a> Jimmy right now, it would be a good tool for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8108.172s">Like</a> he said, it's embarrassing to say to someone, I'll give you a quarter so you can go pay the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8113.553s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8114.313s">When</a> the guy does come into Jimmy's shop or any other shop in the community and they say, hey, you're a good customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8119.315s">Next</a> time you come in here, the pocket's on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8121.296s">And</a> you give them one of these tokens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8124.296s">I</a> mean, that goes far. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8127.017s">Many</a> businesses in this community I know are very, very much for that, whether it's a local barbershop, whether it's some of our bigger restaurants.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8185.714s">Some</a> of these machines have been acting up to, to the point where it's been very customer friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8190.017s">You</a> throw in a quarter, and you get two quarters back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8192.997s">It,</a> uh, it happened to me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8194.978s">And,</a> uh, I know you put it right back though. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8197.159s">Yes,</a> of course I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8198.0s">I</a> put the quarter right back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8200.021s">I</a> drove to the, I drove to the office in South Medford and I gave it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8205.624s">Um,</a> no, but, uh, um, I've been hearing that too, that some of them have been actually spitting quarters back out to the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8214.308s">Somebody,</a> um, somebody sent me an email joke and said, yeah, it's, it's probably wind casino that owns the, owns the things they're trying to get people in their casino. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8222.58s">But</a> with that being said, I'd just like to get an update on the tokens, because as Councilor Caraviello, we're all aware that they are coming, and they said it can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8231.806s">But</a> deciding to do it and putting it into effect are two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8235.809s">And</a> quite honestly, I think right now, this is a slow time of year anyway for all the businesses, especially restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8241.673s">Right</a> after Christmas, January, February, March, every restaurant I've talked to said this is typically their slow season. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8247.037s">I</a> think these would come in more handy now than in <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8250.694s">the</a> end of the year, next year, November, when it's traditional busy time of year, Christmas season. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8255.942s">So</a> if we could just get an update on those two, the usage report, and when I say usage report, the same data that you provided us a few weeks ago with the amount of people that use the machine as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8266.613s">tickets</a> that were issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8267.954s">And</a> last but not least on the tokens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8269.835s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8270.615s">Thanks</a> chief.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8733.283s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8738.886s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8739.987s">For</a> those of the individuals that don't know, Father Kevin Toomey recently got notified of his reassignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8746.972s">And</a> this is a major, major blow to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8749.473s">Raphael's</a> Parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8750.794s">St.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8751.014s">Raphael's</a> is a great parish community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8754.196s">Father</a> Toomey has done an exemplary job down there, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8760.02s">He's</a> been there for <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8762.253s">15</a> or so years, and he is solely responsible for getting people to pledge support financially to build the new Paris Center, which cost around $6 million, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8773.943s">And</a> for that, the community and the parish is grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8777.105s">And</a> we want to wish him well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8778.385s">And</a> I think it's more than appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8780.366s">He's</a> around until June, until he goes to his new assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8783.888s">But</a> I think we should get him down here just to acknowledge him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8786.87s">He</a> was a stalwart supporter of putting up the crossing signs and the lights in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8793.053s">Raphael's</a> Parish for the children of the community, and just was always there for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8798.495s">And</a> I'm going to miss him, not only as my parish <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8802.02s">Pastor,</a> but more importantly, as a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8805.101s">So</a> if we can get him down here at a meeting to receive a congratulation note from the Medford City Council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9102.062s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9102.943s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9104.144s">I</a> would be remiss if I didn't congratulate Uncle Bob, as people often refer to him as. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9111.47s">Him</a> and his wife Cheryl are the proud grandparents of Willow Skye. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9115.914s">And</a> Willow Skye now has the proud parents, Dr. Marty Marin and beautiful Alexandra Mayako Marin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9124.099s">The</a> baby was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9126.961s">And</a> baby and mom are doing great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9128.522s">They</a> just came home a few days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9130.723s">And</a> I just want to congratulate them.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9133.445s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9134.186s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9134.346s">So</a> congratulations to Mr. President, his wife, and the entire family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9138.428s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9376.275s">Yes,</a> I know we did laugh about it a little earlier regarding the climate control in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9382.078s">I</a> wouldn't expect any secretary, any public employee in this building or school or any municipal building <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9387.363s">to</a> work in the temperatures that we've worked in the last two, a couple of council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9393.666s">This</a> is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9395.187s">If</a> there's a problem with the system in this room, then the mayor and or his designee can get it taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9401.371s">In</a> the summertime, it's stifling in here and it's freezing in here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9406.113s">I</a> think no one can argue with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9407.434s">We</a> have people that actually left the meeting because of the temperature in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9411.016s">It's...</a> And you're ailing, but my feet are numb.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9456.526s">And</a> just to follow up, a few weeks ago, Alicia Hunt was in here adjusting the temperature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9463.391s">And</a> I believe they had it set to go off at like 9 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9466.033s">I</a> don't remember a city council meeting in the history of the city of Medford for the past 30 years that hasn't <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9471.995s">gone</a> till nine o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9473.696s">So,</a> uh, has gone, you know what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9476.877s">Has</a> gone, um, less than nine o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9479.938s">It</a> was about a, uh, six month range where some of the meetings were shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9484.219s">Um,</a> but that was due just to the smaller agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9488.18s">This</a> is, uh, this is absurd.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9499.004s">I</a> say we don't, we, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9501.0s">We</a> shouldn't be meeting in this temperature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9502.3s">If</a> it's again like this, really, we should postpone the meeting.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c/2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c.html">Medford City Council - January 20, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=576.924s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=578.265s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Cavill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=579.746s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=580.707s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=582.742s">You</a> make a motion for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=584.964s">I'd</a> like to make a motion for approval on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=587.245s">This</a> is a long overdue thing in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=589.827s">We're</a> proud to have many nursing facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=592.089s">But</a> one thing that I like to see as an elected official is give people the opportunity to participate in programs and still maintain ownership and residence in their own homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=602.916s">And</a> this is going to be another particular case for Medford residents to be able to do that, similar to the Buddy Coholan Center that we have for people with Alzheimer's and dementia. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=612.629s">as</a> well as some other smaller establishments in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=617.291s">But</a> I think this will be a great addition to the South Medford neighbourhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=620.932s">And</a> this will also spur some economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=623.553s">If</a> you have, say, 30 clients and you have to feed 30 people, they're going to be doing grocery shopping in the area or utilising local businesses, whether it may be for prescriptions or first aid stuff or things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=636.377s">So</a> I see this as a win-win to keep a building from being vacant in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=641.192s">And</a> I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2200.261s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2202.682s">I</a> think it, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2205.201s">The</a> gentleman said it a little bit differently than I stated it earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2210.442s">All</a> the votes in motions that were put before this Medford City Council, that were put before this Medford City Council, were unanimous votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2219.625s">Now</a> I understand what the council is talking about, the final vote that we asked for to come back to this council, but the mayor, under his authority, didn't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2230.587s">But</a> we are unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2232.669s">We</a> were unanimous on the two votes that were taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2234.81s">And</a> the two that this council took were one given the mayor the authority, which was a seven to zero vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2241.916s">And</a> then the other vote was the night of the RFP or RFQ. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2246.359s">I</a> forget exactly what it was, but we went over the language of the contract for a couple hours over here back, and I believe it was March of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2255.706s">And</a> it was a seven zero vote to report it out of committee.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2499.849s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2502.391s">So</a> I just have one question for the councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2505.373s">So</a> the <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2506.874s">request</a> for proposal that originally went out that you voted on, you didn't know what was in that contract when you took that vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2515.738s">We</a> had a vote back in March, I think it was March, when we sat at the committee of the whole and went over the request for proposal before Louise Miller put it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2525.023s">Before</a> she put it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2526.724s">The</a> records... Mr. Dello Russo, I'm council president. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2529.885s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2530.445s">I</a> think you made a very good solution before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2533.747s">The</a> city clerk is the official record keeper of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2537.514s">Please</a> give us the votes, Mr. Clerk, on the meeting for the request for proposal that originally went out, and then for giving the mayor the 10 years authority.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2564.093s">That</a> never, ever took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2565.834s">There's</a> two different meetings that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2568.234s">The</a> council is trying to make it look, because he wants to make it look like he took one vote this way, that way, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2573.835s">No</a> he didn't, I'm not taking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2574.956s">There</a> was a seven to nothing vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2578.183s">to</a> send out the request for proposal to the vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2582.687s">Yeah,</a> I'm not arguing with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2584.429s">But</a> if you now want to change the whole program, I'm not saying that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2598.362s">Councilman,</a> you knew it was in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2599.844s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2600.384s">I</a> didn't know it was in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2601.445s">Neither</a> did you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2606.231s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2606.351s">Yes,</a> you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2607.092s">The</a> request for proposal went out back in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2609.555s">So</a> like I said, you know something, Councilman? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2611.096s">That's</a> a request for proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2611.977s">That's</a> not the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2612.618s">With</a> all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2613.639s">With</a> all due respect, I've been watching this for longer than before I was on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2618.402s">You</a> fought something, then you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2619.883s">You</a> just like to make steam. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2621.384s">You</a> never let the truth get in the way of a good story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2623.426s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2624.406s">The</a> only one making steam right now is you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2696.42s">I'd</a> like to get the, I'd like for the clerk for once and for all, because I know for a fact Councilor Penta has given misinformation out there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2706.183s">I</a> would like to allow the clerk to give clarification on the two votes that the Medford city council took. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2710.764s">I</a> would like to do that right now, and then we can put this to sleep, and you won't have to deal with counsel.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2736.602s">I</a> don't want to use the word duped. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2741.804s">The</a> contract called that we put our vote behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2748.886s">But</a> at this point to say that we were totally against it and this and that <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2754.428s">up</a> until the final plan that the mayor would... Who's saying that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2756.869s">Nobody's</a> saying that, Paul.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2760.612s">Either</a> you're for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2761.492s">I'm</a> not talking about your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2763.253s">For</a> or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2764.494s">Councilor,</a> it's so convoluted, what you're trying to do... And your mind is convoluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2768.716s">What</a> you're trying to do here is... And your mind is convoluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2770.597s">Councilor...</a> I go by fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2772.638s">Mr.</a> President, I go by fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2774.94s">I'd</a> just like to see the records of the original votes and... <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2779.657s">where</a> it took us to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2781.177s">Because</a> there is, Councilor Caraviello, in conversations with him, has been approached by what, four or five people? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2787.139s">At</a> least through this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2788.599s">I</a> know someone that was sitting next to the councilor when he's saying that you can blame certain councilors for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2793.6s">Let's,</a> let's- Well, bring that person forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2795.78s">Councilor,</a> they don't like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2796.66s">They</a> don't even want to talk to you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2881.582s">But</a> not in the final plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2882.542s">I</a> see what you're saying.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3842.959s">No,</a> I just, um, I wanted to concur with, I think Dr. Stirella had a fair assessment of the entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3851.582s">If</a> for any, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3852.758s">At</a> any point during this, if we felt we didn't like what was in that request for proposal, four members of the city council could have voted not to give the mayor the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3863.823s">At</a> that point, the process would have stopped, like Councilor Mark said, until he'd come back with something that was palatable that would then give him the authority to go out for the 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3875.388s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3876.328s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3928.916s">Yes,</a> Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3930.136s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3930.496s">My</a> apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3931.417s">And</a> as I was stating, and Councilor Marks was 100% correct, this whole <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3939.897s">All</a> the internal language of the final document was the mayor and the mayor only. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3946.259s">We</a> had several recommendations getting us up to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3948.58s">I,</a> for one, wanted regular meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3951.041s">You</a> put a quarter in and that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3952.522s">This</a> council supported that unanimously way back when at one of the early on meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3957.564s">So</a> Councilor Marks is correct when he says that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3960.985s">But</a> my point is, I just want everyone to know that, and I'm trying to say this the right way so that Councilor Marks <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3966.584s">because</a> I understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3967.625s">People</a> are getting confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3968.985s">And</a> as the young lady from West Medford stated, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3971.147s">Blackburn,</a> I don't know if she left, but as she stated, everyone is saying it's the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3976.41s">And</a> then when certain members of the council are just trying to throw this off on other people and this and that, all the votes that were taken by this council, all the votes that were actually taken by the call of the yeas and nays regarding parking has been unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3990.859s">Now,</a> once the final,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4005.537s">Like</a> I said, Mr. President, Councilor Penta can say whatever he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4009.08s">He</a> can backpedal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4010.402s">But</a> the bottom line is, we saw the request for proposal early in 2014, as Dr. Stirella stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4018.289s">We</a> gave the mayor the authority, knowing what was in that written proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4022.385s">So</a> you know what, if we feel like maybe we made a mistake doing it, then let's say that we made a mistake and it's something different than we thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4030.678s">But</a> to throw the red herring out that three members of this council, or four members, or five members, or six members of this council voted one way and other members didn't, it was unanimous, all the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4041.822s">And</a> the city clerk's gonna give it to us next week because I asked for that in the form of a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4046.744s">So</a> once it's apples to apples, I may take out a full page ad in the Medford transcript so that the people can see that Councilor Penta is not being forthcoming and truthful 100% on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4088.236s">And</a> was there?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4094.179s">He</a> can say it any way he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4098.101s">And</a> as I stated, Mr. President, when the councillor wants to do coffee talk banter and blame certain members of this council, the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4107.826s">You're</a> running around the town telling.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4123.394s">Thank</a> you, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4125.015s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4125.415s">Let</a> the people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4126.255s">If</a> I could just finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4127.035s">I'm</a> going to wrap up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4127.856s">Councilor</a> Camuso is going to wrap up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4130.196s">I'm</a> going to wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4131.777s">But</a> when I have people that are telling me, when Councilor Caraviello is having people tell him directly, four or five people, and other councillors are hearing the same stuff, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4143.24s">All</a> these different groups are not making it up that this is what's being said out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4147.683s">So</a> I just want the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4149.024s">The</a> truth will set everybody free. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4151.186s">The</a> truth will set us free. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4152.607s">So</a> the clerk next week will come back with the documents, and then we'll see in the local newspaper, come election time, if Councilor Penta's words come back to bite him.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5141.607s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5143.168s">Thank</a> you to the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5144.809s">Hey,</a> chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5147.911s">I</a> think, uh, I think one thing that I think we could look at, um, doing pretty quick and it's similar to what councilor Marks and councilor Lungo said, I'm not so sure the contract, if there's even room for negotiation for total 15 minutes or 30 minutes free, I would love to see it, but realistically, I'm not so sure the contract, that's something we'd be able to achieve through negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5171.145s">I</a> think we might be able to achieve something, though, where from the time of your expiration, you don't actually get a written ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5178.808s">You</a> give a 10-minute leeway at the end of it before you get that violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5183.571s">So</a> similar to a speeding ticket, when you're out tagging and it's 25 miles an hour, I'm not going to say it out loud, but there's a traditional formula they use. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5193.675s">If</a> you go above certain thing over, you know what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5196.997s">With</a> that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5199.056s">I</a> think that's something that could give some instant relief and help out, even if we do it for six months, just a 10 minute at the end of the, when it's about to expire. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5211.444s">So</a> if your thing expires 125, Republic doesn't write a ticket until 136. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5216.106s">So</a> you get a 10 minute leeway at the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5220.249s">We're</a> still going to be turning over the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5222.27s">I</a> think that would have a good intent as far as turning over parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5227.362s">not</a> hammering people with tickets, but holding them accountable if they're over the limit by 11, uh, 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5233.727s">And</a> then once they hit that, um, next one, is that something that Republic, I mean, and not talking about contractual, but I think that's something that would make more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5242.994s">And</a> listen, I have to preface it by, I think all of us here would love to see the first 15 minutes of the 30 minutes free, but there's really going to be no way to police that because it's actually, when you're putting the money in the kiosk, that's, what's actually initiating <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5255.716s">with</a> all the data and the information technology that you got there at 1 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5260.097s">So</a> they're not going to know when the 15 minutes started, when it didn't start. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5263.657s">You</a> know what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5264.277s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5266.218s">That's</a> just the way information technology works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5270.378s">But</a> on the other end, that's something fairly easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5272.579s">That's</a> just a training piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5274.739s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that we look for a 10-minute grace period at the end of each thing before a violation is given, at least for a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5285.875s">to</a> get people knowledgeable and even, well actually, I was gonna say give those fake ones out like they were given out, not a fake one, but a zero dollar one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5296.078s">But</a> I just think that achieves our goal of turning over spots, but it's also holding people accountable with a little breathing room. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5306.722s">So</a> I'd like to make that a motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5325.902s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5327.484s">And</a> to Republic, to follow up on that, has any cities and towns done something like that that you're aware of, where you guys would just instruct your people not to write the violation for the 10 minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5341.975s">Oh,</a> that's not on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5393.859s">So</a> I'd like to make the motion for the 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5396.039s">And</a> I know now we can initiate, well, we want it 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5400.281s">10</a> minutes, I think is reasonable when you <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5402.562s">when</a> you're running in real quick, just to get the ball rolling, the conversation started between the mayor and the company.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5542.826s">So</a> I just, I'll wrap up on this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5544.727s">Um,</a> I'd like to make it so that there's a 10 minute grace period at the end of each expired, um, session.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5874.677s">Yes,</a> it's in our contract though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5876.358s">I</a> believe Councilor Penta, I don't know if he stated it, that they cannot use this information.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5882.32s">They</a> can't.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5883.04s">They</a> won't use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5883.779s">Because</a> no, you just said Mr. Nash, his company in Republic in New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5887.321s">You</a> said someone has their data.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5892.685s">All</a> right, because I misunderstood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5895.106s">I</a> thought you knew something, and I was going to tell you to call the FBI if that was the case, with all the stuff going on in today's day and age.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5905.934s">I'm</a> sorry, Anthony.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6209.785s">Motion</a> to leave this open. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6212.066s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6647.138s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6648.899s">Councilor</a> Knight brought this up in the past too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6652.775s">If</a> something's going to be under suspension, every member of this council should have the courtesy of at least seeing it and signing off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6658.863s">This</a> wasn't under suspension, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6661.126s">No,</a> the other paper that you just handed to him.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6665.212s">I</a> understand the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6670.806s">Did</a> he give you, I thought it was an original, he said it was 15-032.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6692.159s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6692.479s">And</a> that was my point, Mr. President, because when anything goes under suspension for many members of these council, any member of the council, we all see it, we initial it and then give it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6701.925s">It</a> wasn't a suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6702.905s">When</a> it was given a number earlier, one would assume that it was under suspension and that we didn't sign off on it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6717.814s">We've</a> had many resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6718.875s">Like</a> I said, just moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6721.347s">Anything</a> under suspension, I think we should all see.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6726.629s">Amended</a> on the floor, but not given to the city clerk with a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6729.25s">I</a> said, he read my resolution.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7121.628s">Um,</a> this was already brought up earlier as a, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7125.948s">Resolution</a> as an amendment by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7127.969s">It</a> was I said the ticket talking about it stop and shop in the second question following up people that actually get a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7133.911s">Now,</a> these are the people we're getting up in mornings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7135.972s">Will</a> they actually get an envelope to mail it in as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7137.993s">Other</a> communities get an envelope priests pre it's pre addressed.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7156.424s">Other</a> communities do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7157.885s">Where</a> are people going to be mailing them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7158.965s">To</a> a lockbox out of state somewhere? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7160.326s">Or</a> right to Medford Main Street?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7166.529s">I</a> just, I think it's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7168.35s">I</a> think they're.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7177.394s">Yeah,</a> that's true, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7178.074s">Use</a> an orange envelope with a white ticket.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7307.45s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, just in wrapping this up, Chief Sackle, I would be remissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7314.212s">And</a> I think all of us, while we're not, we're not thoroughly happy the way things are been rolled out, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7322.65s">But</a> there's been one person that is a city employee that has been doing a great job with this, and that's the gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7331.694s">I've</a> met him on several occasions over the past two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7335.636s">He</a> actually got in his vehicle, come out, met this man right here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7340.297s">And</a> I can appreciate when we say that we want him doing chief of police business, but for taking on the additional responsibility, Chief, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7349.336s">We</a> couldn't have had a better person in this city doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7351.278s">Your</a> personality, your knowledge of the law, and just being responsive to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7358.665s">For</a> our police chief, and this came up earlier in the meeting, and I wasn't going to let him go home tonight without bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7369.595s">Last</a> week, this man personally went down <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7373.157s">Did</a> you pay the meter, though, when you went to every square?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7375.558s">Every</a> square.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7377.658s">Every</a> square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7378.919s">The</a> chief went to every single square that have these kiosks, walked around all the businesses, answered questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7386.961s">And</a> he didn't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7389.101s">You</a> know what?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7392.582s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7393.302s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7393.702s">I</a> haven't finished the square, Medford Square, yet.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7396.863s">There</a> is some businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7397.943s">But</a> like I said, I just. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7400.214s">You</a> know what, he's been the point person, and we couldn't have a better department head doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7404.196s">And</a> thank you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7405.316s">And</a> this will all quiet down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7406.817s">As</a> far as the rollout, and it's way above your pay grade, it could have went a little bit more seamless. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7413.979s">I</a> think there could have been a lot of more information getting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7417.561s">But</a> you're doing an outstanding job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7419.882s">And</a> I'm speaking for all the councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7421.342s">Even</a> Councilor Penter and I, I bet you're in agreement with this 180%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7423.623s">Right,</a> Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7423.963s">Hooray.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7427.15s">He</a> said he don't answer.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9610.629s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9615.356s">Um,</a> I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9618.213s">and</a> I wish we did get notified, but I certainly understand from a homeowner's standpoint that the mayor probably would want to go on vacation and not have you running around the coffee shops yelling that he's out of town and so that someone can probably maybe go to his house and burglarize it because he's on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9635.876s">I</a> mean, it's just, like I said, I just find it quite amusing, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9645.138s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9647.42s">Like</a> I said, I can understand, but... Is that a point of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9651.421s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9652.382s">No,</a> when you go to Florida with your friends, you don't tell people.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9657.964s">Nor</a> should you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk/2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk.html">Medford City Council - January 13, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=57.543s">I'd</a> like suspension of rule number 33 to take item 15-012.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=95.566s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=97.007s">As</a> we're all aware, the city has several accounts, the overlay surplus account, the linkage account, water and sewer enterprise, certified free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=106.773s">I</a> think it's about time that this city council asked the mayor to have an actual account in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=115.287s">for</a> long-term stabilization of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=118.189s">You</a> know, the mayor's not going to be here forever, and we want to make sure that there is a stabilization fund in place so that in years to come, this city can be financially stabilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=134.439s">In</a> the past, I know Budget Director Burke, as a member of this council, often called for a capital improvement fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=141.418s">And</a> I just think this is a good way where, come budget time, we could actually ask the mayor, hey, we would like to see X amount of dollars put into this actual account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=151.606s">And</a> I just think it's something that we have to do to think about the future of our children, that someday we'll be the leaders in this community, and to make sure that we set it up in a way that will be financially stable for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=166.918s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=169.556s">on</a> setting up an actual municipal city account for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=173.979s">On</a> the motion of approval by Councilor Camuso, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=289.281s">I</a> can understand where you're coming from, and I do not oppose it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=293.322s">The</a> intent of this at this point is to open the line item account so that it's an actual line item come budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=299.144s">And</a> then at that point, I think that would be the appropriate opportunity as we're going through the budget line by line to say, as a council, we'd like to see X amount put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=309.009s">As</a> we know, there's many accounts throughout the city budget right now that are funded for $1. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=313.111s">But</a> if you want to put a dollar amount, amend the paper to put a dollar amount in there, I would support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=319.574s">But</a> ultimately, if the mayor decides that he's not for that dollar amount, I think we have to be reasonable here and first set up the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=327.458s">And</a> moving forward, fund it in a manner that will stabilize our community for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=332.581s">So</a> if you want to put a dollar amount, I'll support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=335.042s">But</a> if he doesn't agree with that, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=337.605s">I</a> just would hate to have him say that this is the end of it, and at least a small dollar amount to get the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=344.248s">Because</a> if we do this every year, or if he appropriates the money throughout the year, too, at the end of the year, oftentimes, we're transferring money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=353.513s">I</a> would like to see it going to a stabilization fund rather than the free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=358.555s">Because</a> ultimately, big projects like the police station are going to be bonded. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=362.537s">And</a> if we can have money in an account for that specific purpose, and I have to be clear, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=367.437s">This</a> is not for the new police station and the new police station only. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=371.099s">This</a> is for the stabilization of our community for major projects like the police station, like other things that may come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=377.123s">So</a> I just don't want to be misleading to the community like you had mentioned, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=381.126s">So</a> if you want to put a dollar amount, I'll support it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=460.543s">Well,</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=461.924s">Uh,</a> it's my motion at this point, I'll even strike out the police station, uh, wording and just set up the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=468.37s">It</a> takes four votes of the council to set up the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=471.434s">And</a> I think we have to just set up the account with the intent of big projects like the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=475.615s">Because</a> you're right, council, I don't want to pit group against group and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=480.637s">In</a> order for the mayor to utilize the money, he's going to need the votes of this council anyway at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=485.439s">So</a> if I can, Mr. President, strike out the word such as the police station in the near future and just set up for any major projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=495.462s">And</a> if you want to put a dollar amount, go ahead.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=577.704s">This</a> would be an account, a line item in the budget, a municipal account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=582.768s">set</a> up by the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=585.51s">And</a> going forward, naturally, if the mayor wanted to put any money from any of those other accounts into this account, he'd have to get votes of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=592.774s">So</a> I'd be happy with it, setting the account up with the $1 amount and working with the mayor throughout the calendar year and years to come to fund it as we see fit.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=723.247s">That</a> was not the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=724.889s">We</a> can't tax any more until next December anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=727.31s">So</a> I just want to be loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=728.911s">This</a> is not to raise taxes or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=731.973s">It's</a> taking the existing funds or and or come budget time to put funds in it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1107.255s">If</a> I can, I agree with Councilor Penta totally. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1114.378s">Which</a> cleanup? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1115.238s">Making</a> it an amendment or do you want to add your name to the original paper and we can do whatever you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1121.319s">I</a> know the two part prong approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1123.3s">Establish</a> the account and then do what Councilor Lungo and Councilor Marks said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1127.041s">After</a> the dollar account is established, it's just a line item in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1130.121s">It</a> may not be funded for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1131.902s">We</a> have things that are funded.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1183.69s">Mr.</a> President, I agree with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1188.292s">I</a> support your amendment wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1190.253s">I'd</a> like to establish this and then send this to the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1194.365s">for</a> discussion to fund it in the future, prior to the budget this year, but as far as getting the, this council has to be proactive by getting that account set up, even if he does it, he may tell us no, he's not doing it, but at least get the account set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1206.994s">There's</a> no harm in doing that, as Councilor Pence has stated, and I thank you for meeting me halfway, Councilor Penter, on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1424.078s">It's</a> a stabilization fund for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1427.059s">I</a> put the police station in, but you were brought up a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1429.52s">The</a> library needed this 1.2 for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1432.301s">So</a> just set up the account as a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1436.643s">And</a> then the committee of the whole sort of keep it simple at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1917.633s">As</a> amended by Councilor Pence.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3524.259s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3530.303s">On</a> this particular matter, I know it's, I want to choose my words carefully here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3538.48s">If</a> the council wants to expand the program to bakeries and sub shops and other businesses, then bring the motion forward and I'm sure that people will support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3549.464s">But</a> just to start talking about this business, that business and stuff, I just think it's unfair because if you want to expand the program, bring it forward if you think there's some inequities out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3562.628s">But</a> just to throw generalities out there, no one knows what you're talking about.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3759.281s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3759.521s">A</a> couple of questions for the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3760.802s">And</a> then, uh, I actually have a statement I want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3763.063s">We</a> got in this pocket program, but first, um, the outcome of the handicap parking, did you get to the bottom of that?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3807.691s">Um,</a> just to follow up, um, this was something that, uh, today I, I saw a child almost get hit by a vehicle today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3815.627s">at</a> the corner of Playstead Road and High Street, there's a vehicle that parks there every day with a handicapped plate in an illegal spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3822.992s">It's</a> painted yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3824.794s">It's</a> painted yellow as clear as day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3828.136s">And</a> it's between two crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3830.798s">If</a> I've ever seen a dangerous situation, that child came right out, and it was after the crossing guards were gone this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3838.543s">That</a> vehicle should not be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3840.285s">And</a> I've often said it as I was driving by, I'm just surprised that it doesn't get tagged, doesn't get tagged, doesn't get tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3845.529s">But</a> today there was almost an awful accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3849.312s">I</a> think you have to do something about that vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3851.914s">They</a> have a legitimate handicapped sticker, then park it legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3857.659s">Don't</a> park it illegally where someone's going to get injured because you're blocking the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3862.763s">That</a> is unacceptable as far as I'm concerned, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3865.345s">And</a> I think you have to deal with that situation because it's every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3868.308s">It's</a> every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3869.929s">And</a> I almost saw a kid get hit today and I would have felt horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3873.983s">If</a> someone got hurt, and I didn't bring this to your attention earlier, but today it stuck out like a sore thumb.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3902.617s">Listen,</a> I don't care who parks there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3904.678s">You</a> could be someone that I disagree in the community with 180%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3906.778s">If</a> you're going to park illegally, and it's blatant disregard for two crosswalks, someone with a handicap sticker should understand and not park between a crosswalk where elderly and senior citizens and other handicapped people use. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3927.281s">retaliation</a> for the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3929.422s">This</a> is America. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3930.622s">Anyone</a> can speak up for or against any issue, but don't think you're untouchable because you may just, uh, you may just, uh, it's not, it's believe me, the police department is not treating them as untouchable.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3943.547s">No,</a> I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3944.368s">But,</a> and like I said, this was, and I have to preface this, many people have brought that vehicle to my attention before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3951.815s">And</a> you know, you drive by and you see it, it's really not bothering anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3956.097s">But</a> when a car came around from high street, taking the right on Playstead Road, and it was a child, and the child actually popped his head back, would you be in agreement that it's a major safety issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3969.863s">Oh,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3971.544s">And</a> as well, I've talked to other people that have drove engine two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3976.266s">That</a> vehicle actually, and this was years ago when it was a different car that was parking there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3979.507s">I'm</a> not even sure if it's the same owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3981.049s">But</a> Engine 2 sometimes has to make that swing when they're coming down High Street and making the swing to go down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3989.517s">And</a> it's gotten the way before they've actually had to do a three-point turn on the way to an emergency call. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3996.083s">And</a> last but not least, on that particular matter, the person can legally park in front of their store, from what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4005.612s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4007.02s">Take</a> a spot in front of your store that a customer may park in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4009.642s">Legally,</a> you don't have to pay the meter like everyone else, because you have a legitimate handicap placket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4015.988s">But</a> park it in a safe manner, as far as I'm concerned.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4031.38s">It's</a> not about- please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4034.023s">Mr.</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4036.098s">Another</a> thing that's come to my attention with this park, and we have to set the record straight on this, a senior member of the mayor's office that lives in this community, one of his longest serving members in that office, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4049.16s">has</a> been putting statements on social media outlets that the reason this pocket is in place is because the Medford City Council didn't support a garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4060.803s">I</a> want to make it loud and loud and loud and clear that the mayor of this community never brought a proposal to the Medford City Council for a garage because he did not have the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4073.526s">And</a> if we remember, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4075.848s">I,</a> as one member of this council, urged him, urged him to take it to the council, take a vote up or down, and move forward on the issue, just like the Brooks estates and other issues that were before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4088.157s">I</a> think it was pretty common knowledge that four members of the city council at the time were for a garage, three members of the council were against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4094.282s">But</a> to throw the red herring out there that the Medford City Council is a direct result for this, that is not only a- Point of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4189.448s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4191.29s">Just</a> to be very clear, this council, the paper was before us for the parking program, and I'm not backpedaling at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4199.725s">seven</a> members of this council saw the request for proposal, seven members of this council knew what it was going to consist of, the meter slash kiosk, but for someone in the administrative wing of this building to blatantly throw that out there, that that's the result, just because they're probably filled in hundreds and hundreds of calls per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4218.939s">It's</a> just outright wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4221.621s">Put</a> the facts out there, that the mayor didn't bring that garage to this council because he knew he didn't have the votes at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4226.785s">And</a> I'll quite honestly tell you, I made my stance known at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4230.168s">I</a> was for the garage, and I was upset that he did not bring it forward and just put it behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4235.552s">Take</a> the vote, move on to the next issue, like we're supposed to do in the democratic process.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5079.761s">Built</a> to grow after the program's already established. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5083.002s">The</a> point of information I have is some of these ones, they're not in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5089.082s">a</a> major square, as long as the time limit is enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5096.145s">The</a> whole purpose of this is to keep the turnover so that if there's a bunch of stores together, it's not just one business that's getting all the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5104.548s">It's</a> for the turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5105.288s">That's</a> what we heard loud and clear, at least from the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5108.009s">If</a> it's like Joe's Pizza, I don't want to use names, but down in the Arlington line, if they're parking cars out there all day, it's only affecting Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5118.275s">That</a> one establishment, if you go down to Haines Square or West Medford or Medford Square, and you park a car out there all day, you're having a residual effect on all the businesses that can't have their customers parked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5129.739s">So</a> I think the rationale was to do the major ones first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5132.0s">Is</a> that correct for that reason?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5134.461s">Because</a> it was the turnover thing that the Chamber of Commerce was looking for.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6728.078s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6728.918s">Counsel</a> Kamosa. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6730.819s">Um,</a> is it actually waived or was there an arrangement made with the city that the city would pick up that portion or was it just, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6738.791s">In</a> good faith, wave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6740.351s">It's</a> gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6741.092s">No</a> one's picking it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6741.812s">No</a> one's paying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6742.472s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6742.752s">So</a> it wasn't in lieu of the fee now that the citizens don't see the city's paying it on some other end.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6757.417s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6757.677s">But</a> to be very clear, people that are using Park Mobile still will pay the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6762.42s">Yeah,</a> that's, that's a third party. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6763.581s">You</a> just have to spell that out because people will be coming back here saying I got a fee and this and that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6772.928s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6773.589s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6773.989s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6774.91s">You're</a> all set.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6776.111s">Councilor</a> Camuso and then the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6778.432s">Real</a> quick to the chief of police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6780.694s">Um,</a> just two, two things on within the squares, uh, West side preschool in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6786.639s">Can</a> you put that on the traffic commission to get drop off slash pickup for the business please at the next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6792.874s">They're</a> dealing with the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6795.414s">High</a> street people getting dropped off, picked up.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6805.076s">And</a> then, last but not least, the T bus stops throughout the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6809.357s">I</a> think this would be the appropriate time to look at moving some of them outside of the squares, maybe, just a little bit, to free up additional spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6819.539s">Can</a> you, rather than making it <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6821.803s">The</a> City Council bringing recommendations forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6823.824s">I</a> know that in the past, there's a restaurant establishment in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6827.646s">This</a> may be the time where you look at things like that so that it frees up additional parking, like the liquor store in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6835.671s">There's</a> a bus stop there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6838.452s">Would</a> it make more sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6839.973s">I'm</a> not familiar with that gentleman over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6843.135s">He's</a> acting strange, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6845.076s">I</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6846.897s">Oh,</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6847.877s">We'll</a> observe proper decorum in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6850.359s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6851.332s">It's</a> kind of just a little odd when I was looking at the Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6854.655s">So</a> anyway, Chief, as I was saying, the bus stops though, to free up additional spaces for the businesses slash consumers, I think maybe just look at it as we're doing this program to see if it makes sense to move any of them to give additional spots in certain areas.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6905.039s">And</a> then that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6907.38s">There</a> are businesses throughout the community that are within the districts that have bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6912.264s">And</a> that's the reason why they don't have a kiosk because <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6915.267s">of</a> the bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6916.448s">And</a> I think people have to be cognizant of that, because people have been saying, well, why isn't this business? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6920.39s">That's</a> why you can't get into that game. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6922.651s">But</a> it is, particularly in South Medford, some of the bus stops, the reason the kiosk didn't go in certain areas is because of bus stops and limited parking as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6932.897s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6934.338s">And</a> Westside Preschool, if you can put that on there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8695.728s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8697.789s">And</a> I'm very glad you brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8700.891s">A</a> few minutes ago, we had a young lady at the podium <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8704.493s">and</a> discussing making her street, just the city with the wave of a lawn, make her street resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8710.798s">This</a> is exactly the reason why the city doesn't want to do it without community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8718.184s">This</a> is a perfect example and I feel, excuse me, I definitely understand your concerns and this is why if a certain neighbourhood wants to institute resident parking, the whole neighbourhood's notified <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8735.583s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8736.323s">And</a> the chief will address your concerns.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9596.538s">Councilor</a> Penta referred to it as a revenue enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9600.461s">Can</a> you just explain that one of years? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9604.238s">You</a> said revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9605.138s">He</a> just called it a revenue enforcement program.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10364.929s">We</a> can't monitor the entire city every two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10367.31s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10370.171s">Contractual</a> question for you, following up on Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10374.033s">Limited</a> to two in the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10377.414s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10387.579s">But</a> who makes the determination whether it's two hours a week? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10392.104s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10392.865s">How</a> many hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10394.827s">92</a> hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10395.448s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10395.788s">But</a> there's the ability to expand that if the needs be.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10406.409s">The</a> reason I, the reason I asked that if your revenues aren't what you like, now you put out 25 people doing tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10412.012s">No,</a> we don't have the ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10413.373s">I</a> want to make sure you don't have the authority to, uh, you can't say, uh, you know what is hopefully people just play by the rules and you guys go bankrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10424.98s">That's</a> what I'm hoping. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10426.281s">But,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10427.947s">Uh,</a> yeah, no, I just want to make sure that, uh, and, and that would be our lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10432.089s">I'd</a> like to ask the question, what the max is to our legal department, because I don't want to see next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10437.531s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10437.791s">We're</a> now buying an extra seven vehicles and there's going to be nine cars out there now, ticket and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10442.132s">At</a> least right now with two cars, it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10444.593s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10445.273s">Right</a> now it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10446.694s">If</a> the car's in Haines square, you might get away with it 20 times in West Medford, but that one time that the car's down in West Medford, you're getting a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10453.036s">So</a> it's not a guarantee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10453.957s">Every</a> time you're taking a gamble, just like when you go to Winchester center, it's a gamble right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10457.992s">You</a> go to Davis Square, it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10459.733s">But</a> with that being said, the more people you put on the road, your odds are getting better that you're going to get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10464.757s">And</a> I want to make sure that this isn't revenue-driven, the decision to put more cars on the road to ticket more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10470.821s">So</a> I'd like to ask that through our legal department. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10472.682s">I</a> think that's very important.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10497.233s">No,</a> officers, because listen, if they want to make revenue, they may just take a 15-passenger van and start dropping these ambassadors in all the squares.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10506.358s">You</a> ever see the Boston Transportation Department? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10508.639s">They</a> show up with a little orange light on the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10510.7s">Next</a> thing you know, there's 15 people jumping out with their little handheld things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10513.521s">And</a> that's not what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10516.773s">I'm</a> concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10517.993s">Let</a> me ask you a question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10569.763s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10571.804s">If,</a> if indeed the mayor, and I have to say up to this point, we have no reason to believe that this is a revenue enhancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10578.626s">We</a> haven't seen it yet, but listen, the mayor is hearing this loud and clear as much as we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10583.488s">I'm</a> sure he doesn't want, he'd rather not have any revenue and have no one getting tickets in his phone, not ringing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10589.589s">So</a> as far as that said, I'd like to make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10592.123s">that</a> the mayor limits this to two, at least for the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10595.506s">They</a> don't even negotiate to put more people on the road until an amendment to the contract or whatever it is until at least a year.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10628.067s">And</a> here's the other one other thing to follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10631.19s">The</a> chief of police still has the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10634.406s">The</a> chief of police still has the authority to give out tickets, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10638.549s">In</a> the off hours, I would rather see police officers given the opportunity to come in on overtime if they decide that they're going to whatever, because it's going to pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10648.137s">And</a> my rationale with that is it puts an additional police officer on the road that can respond to a baby choking, can respond to a bank robbery, can respond to things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10655.703s">A</a> meter ambassador isn't going to be able to respond to 911 calls and things of that nature if there's a serious emergency in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10662.349s">And</a> it's going to pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10664.436s">So</a> I think that that's important too, that the city looks at its own police force to do this on an overtime basis in regards to additional enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10675.024s">Because</a> I'm a firm believer, and I think all this council is, I can't speak for all the council, but I'm a firm believer, the more police officers we have on the street, whether it's a detail, whether it's overtime, whether it's parking enforcement, the city's in better hands because they got their radio on and they can respond to emergency needs as see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10691.778s">So</a> I'd like to make that amendment too.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10859.313s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10861.315s">Is</a> this staggering? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10862.537s">You</a> used the word staggering. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10864.178s">So</a> does that mean the person that will be out there driving around in this vehicle, one of them will come in, say, four in the afternoon, so in the morning will be down to one vehicle, or will it be two and then an additional person at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10874.83s">The</a> word staggering to me is...
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10906.284s">Should</a> we, um, would it be in the best interest of the city to outfit one of our police cruises or maybe small smart car or something, something environmentally friendly that has the same thing, but it's actually a patrol vehicle police.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10924.829s">I</a> think then, and like I said, even if it's on an overtime basis, it's going to pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10929.33s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10929.988s">The</a> police officers, I would rather see, because they're going to use their discretion a lot more than a private company, with all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10936.133s">Private</a> company, there's a violation.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10938.955s">The</a> police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10939.796s">Well,</a> the permit packing is what I'm looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10941.737s">Oh,</a> the permit packing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10942.458s">So</a> the permit packing, either you're registered or you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10944.92s">The</a> police officer running out of Sunnyhurst in Haines Square or the convenience store may give you a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10951.365s">With</a> all due respect.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11242.338s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11243.018s">And</a> I heard Councilor Prentis saying continue this next week for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11249.501s">But</a> let's not discuss the same thing week after week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11255.144s">This</a> is, I think, I'm just making my point known. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11259.135s">There</a> are legitimate concerns out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11260.856s">We</a> want to hear legitimate concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11262.917s">But</a> for people to think that we can just make this program go away, now the mayor signed a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11267.939s">Call</a> the mayor's office, voice your concerns with him if you have an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11272.902s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, this council always is here to hear the citizens of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11277.964s">But</a> week after week after week after week after week, bring the legitimate concerns to the members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11286.088s">We'll</a> be here to meet your needs, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11288.63s">We'll</a> put you in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11290.432s">Call</a> us any day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11291.112s">You</a> don't have to wait for Tuesday night to come down here because I can speak for all the members of my council, colleagues that sit around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11298.319s">We</a> respond to people and we try to get them the solutions that they may not like the solution, but it will at least put them in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11305.886s">So,</a> but I just think at some point we have to stop crying that the program's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11312.372s">We</a> have to look to make the program better. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11314.865s">and</a> less.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11538.105s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11540.226s">First</a> of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11541.468s">I'll</a> call a point of information any time I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11544.489s">You</a> have no status in this community, a fine American once said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11547.81s">A</a> fine American once said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11551.331s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11553.032s">Your</a> point of information, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11554.692s">The</a> votes were unanimous on the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11556.753s">So</a> the gentleman makes up fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11560.354s">The</a> facts of the record don't lie.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12034.462s">I</a> would absolutely love to have him here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12037.528s">The</a> fact of the matter is if we want to actually get answers and not yell and scream to get him here when we know he's not coming, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12046.573s">Listen,</a> the best predictor of the future is the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12049.154s">And</a> for the past 30 years, whether I believe it's right, wrong, or indifferent, the next mayor of this community, I'm sure, will be at this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12055.857s">But</a> for the last 30 years, he has not been. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12058.279s">With</a> that being said, if we really want answers, if we really want to give the citizens an opportunity to ask him questions, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12066.327s">Let's</a> do it where the past the past is the best predictor of the future Those things have been answered and that was in the committee of the whole Now we can come out from that committee of the whole and discuss it here on the floor But if it's anything more than theatrics calling for him to come here He's been here once and it was the methadone clinic once you've been here in the city of Medford as a council longer than him as the mayor and he's been here once Once and why was he here? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12089.455s">Tell</a> us why because the methadone clinic <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12090.995s">And</a> why? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12091.555s">There</a> was 300 people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12092.455s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12092.895s">There</a> was 300 people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12093.636s">And</a> he outspotted all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12094.576s">So</a> on the way in, they're throwing rocks at him. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12096.016s">They</a> were carrying him out on their shoulders. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12097.937s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12098.237s">So</a> learn something from the guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12099.577s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12100.317s">There's</a> 20 years ahead of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12101.778s">Let's</a> have him at the Committee of the Whole and get the answers that are important.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12165.738s">And</a> furthermore, as I stated, people that are out there that have concerns like the mom and pop businesses, loading zones, things of that nature, call any member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12177.672s">There's</a> certain members on this council that called for these kiosks in 09. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12180.234s">We</a> want to get you the answers that are important to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12182.956s">Believe</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12184.117s">So</a> if we can just have the open dialogue and people don't have to wait till Tuesday if they don't want to, because as councilor Caraviello stated the last few weeks, there's ongoing dialogue every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12195.465s">The</a> chief 90% of your day I'm sure is this now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12199.068s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12200.769s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12626.705s">Thank</a> you, and I certainly do support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12630.187s">The</a> evening, I think this came up in discussion recently when I put the name of Robert M. Penta forward for the reappointment to the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12639.294s">It</a> was actually discussed that evening, and Councilor Knight at the time said that a resolution would be forthcoming after the first of the year, and here it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12647.159s">And</a> certainly, I do support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12649.481s">We</a> want the best possible people in all these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12654.502s">I</a> support it and I think it's being very proactive and thank you for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12659.408s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12686.353s">Everyone</a> was vetted and the majority of the council did put the person or people in the leadership positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12693.775s">And</a> same as it's been done always. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12696.735s">And</a> just because you may not have the votes, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12699.298s">Cry</a> over sour grapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12700.579s">And</a> I appreciate the unanimity of the voting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12704.12s">For</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12704.58s">The</a> votes to become the president and the vice president.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12709.662s">So</a> don't tell me I didn't have the votes.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12713.384s">I</a> didn't ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12714.284s">Well,</a> it doesn't matter.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1627.203s">Motion</a> to receive and place on file.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1898.346s">It's</a> on motion of Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1900.168s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1903.651s">I</a> agree with Councilor Penter to the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1906.293s">If</a> people are going to use the name Medford, the city seal or anything of that nature, then the city should be a watchdog. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1914.019s">I</a> think this has to be with websites that are out there, domain names and things of that nature too, because people do maliciously name Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1923.986s">for</a> different entities, including the gentleman that just spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1926.907s">So</a> maybe if we want to look at this, we'll look at anything that contains the name Medford and get ahold of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1932.669s">And</a> I look forward to doing that under Councilor Pinter's recommendation at the subcommittee.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2012.347s">Joe,</a> good luck to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2013.127s">I</a> think there's a lot of people out here that want him on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2015.369s">So</a> good luck to you in your future endeavors, Mr. Viglione. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2020.511s">With</a> all due respect, I'm just referring to what my council colleague said. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2024.354s">Nothing</a> to do with the gentleman at the podium stated, but my council colleague actually said it eloquently, Councilor Penta, in any and all institutions and our endeavors that use the word Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2034.719s">And</a> I think it's something that's wise, and I want to applaud Councilor Penta for expanding on the gentleman's views. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2039.682s">So</a> thank you very much, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2191.049s">Quick</a> question for the gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2193.784s">Well,</a> I'd just like to know, do you have press credentials? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2196.146s">Because</a> when other reporters come to this meeting, I notice they actually have credentials issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2204.913s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2205.854s">I'm</a> published in eight books, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2207.175s">I</a> just finished another book. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2208.276s">Do</a> you have press credentials from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2210.417s">Yes</a> or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2210.838s">It's</a> very easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2211.879s">I</a> have my own press credentials, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2213.8s">From</a> the Commonwealth?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2349.998s">I</a> withdraw to receive and place on file.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2553.178s">Do</a> I have a paper on that?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2586.992s">To</a> hear from the Chief of Police as well as concerned citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2590.974s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4760.724s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4761.725s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4762.605s">To</a> the Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4763.146s">Waited</a> patiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4764.686s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4765.587s">And</a> I'm just a little confused because I'm hearing some different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4770.296s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4770.496s">Blackburn,</a> well respected in our community, her years of service in the school department, Councilor Marks, yourself, Marguerite Lynch, Anthony Santoro sat on the original committee back in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4780.021s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4782.302s">Well,</a> 2008 into 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4784.143s">And</a> I went back to some of my old archive records. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4788.245s">The</a> recommendations were the agreement consensus that consistent parking enforcement is needed to provide efficient turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4795.386s">for</a> pocket spaces to assist the local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4798.233s">And</a> one of the members actually was on there as a representative of the Chamber of Commerce at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4802.262s">It's</a> like any other agency or group. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4804.977s">turn</a> over, so that's who was sitting there at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4807.978s">Number</a> two was this particular group recommended parking controls are needed, meters slash kiosks, freestanding pay stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4815.621s">That</a> was number two for the recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4818.142s">And</a> it goes on to say that the parking rules must be fair and consistently enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4823.283s">Now</a> this was back in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4825.344s">Leading</a> up to this, I know there was a first bid that went out <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4828.798s">that</a> consisted of parking enforcement with a parking garage element at Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4835.082s">There</a> wasn't the votes on the Medford City Council to support the garage at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4839.305s">We</a> actually have members that don't even sit on the council anymore that were here for that particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4845.638s">those</a> particular discussions and I would have rather have seen the garage built with strict enforcement and then look at other areas but as far as all the recommendations it looks like a lot of them <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4860.515s">are</a> with this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4861.896s">Now</a> leading up to that, one thing that I disagree with totally on the mayor's plan is, and I said this at the Committee of the Whole meeting back in January, I would have rather seen the freestanding meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4872.903s">I</a> think senior citizens know how to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4875.205s">They're</a> much more, they're much more user-friendly, but I also see the total other side of it where, up near Tufts University now, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4888.165s">People</a> that are living in our community and utilizing up there, everyone, they don't even go into a coffee shop without cash anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4895.291s">Everything</a> is debit card, credit card driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4898.373s">But</a> there is the technology out there that could be standalone meters with kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4903.737s">And</a> I made that loud and clear known at the meeting in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4907.7s">It</a> was actually part of the committee report that was adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4910.622s">But</a> as I said that evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4912.842s">we're</a> making recommendations to the mayor and ultimately this council gave him the authority to go out and up to a ten-year contract by a seven to nothing vote uh... and it leads us back to ultimately given the fact that he's the mayor duly elected by the majority of this community he is the signatory authority uh... at moving any contracts forward so uh... that was really the only piece that this city council had a hand in what i'd like to see them go the route with the <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4942.08s">quarter</a> meters that you just throw in that people have been using. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4944.701s">I</a> remember the quarter meters over in Somerville or over in Charlestown when we were little kids going to get shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4950.544s">You'd</a> throw a quarter in the meter back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4952.524s">People</a> knew how to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4953.445s">They're</a> so user friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4954.945s">But</a> I just think there could have been more public, leading up to this now, the rollout I think could have been publicized more. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4963.669s">This</a> piece of paper is very informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4965.83s">I</a> think it should have been in the hands a little bit sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4968.405s">The</a> other recommendation I would have liked to have seen is started it not in the middle of the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4973.127s">Start</a> it when it's nice out so that people could go up to a machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4975.949s">And</a> right now, I mean, I couldn't even carry my tea in tonight because it was so cold going from the car to here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4982.352s">If</a> I had to run to a kiosk, I'd rather just get the ticket and pay it, I think, because it was so cold out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4988.335s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4991.525s">I</a> think the city has to continue doing outreach, utilizing the 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4997.772s">We</a> get phone calls to say they just put the chalk lines on the baseball field. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5002.136s">This</a> is something big that we should be getting three or four calls on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5005.119s">The</a> outreach, the outreach, the outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5008.985s">The</a> other thing that I'd like to bring up is just to say how we got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5013.248s">This</a> was an initial recommendation of several members of our community that had many recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5019.213s">And</a> after it went from here, the original commission, yourself, Councilor Marks, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5024.416s">Blackburn,</a> and other people, at that point, it was in the hands of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5028.519s">And</a> it sat there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5029.54s">And</a> then it came back to us at one portion just to give the authority to do the 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5036.853s">I</a> just wanna be clear to the people out there that, and you gotta remember too, the last time the halls were this, it was over the trash removal and the recycling bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5049.396s">But</a> given time, people did get in the groove. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5052.136s">I'd</a> like to think that the individual needs of areas like Jimmy's Pizza, areas like the senior center, I'm not singling out Jimmy's Pizza, but you know, the business communities in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5065.983s">Let's</a> be cognizant when we're putting in those free spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5068.836s">If</a> we have to add a couple more. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5070.897s">so</a> that people can run in and do their business and get out right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5074.44s">But</a> I'll be the first one to say, the person that takes that spot for 15 minutes, if it's a 15-minute spot to do a quick errand, and they're there 16 minutes, shame on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5082.585s">They</a> should get double the ticket, because the next person should have the 15 minutes and the 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5088.409s">So</a> I'd just like to get a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5091.631s">Not</a> a commitment, I understand you can't, but that things will be tweaked and looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5096.495s">Because</a> there is stuff, like you said, the senior center, just last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5100.267s">that</a> was thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5101.868s">And</a> there's going to be other areas that you think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5104.45s">The</a> other thing that's very, very important, places of worship in all the funeral parlors in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5110.035s">I</a> actually did some research on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5112.217s">Those</a> meters, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is very important for the people in our community that practice their faith and their religious beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5122.48s">venues</a> that they will be bagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5124.481s">There'll</a> be an actual bag or something all over it on the weekends that says, uh, masks don't whatever the case may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5131.304s">And</a> the mayor has assured me that that will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5134.086s">Are</a> you under that impression as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5135.206s">They're</a> bagged or they're just not enforced during that time.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5173.25s">Any</a> of those things are more of a common sense way of doing the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5177.374s">And</a> the other thing that, um, that I'm glad the mayor listened to this council on, cause I actually made a recommendation, um, back when we had another piece of this whole puzzle, the other area where the city council was involved, it was the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5189.403s">to</a> combine two of the commissions and give the authority to one commission rather than an off-street parking commission and a traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5196.046s">You</a> get too many hands in the soup, the soup gets spoiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5198.487s">So</a> we successfully, as a council, passed that, sent it to the state house, the governor signed it, and it came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5204.74s">But</a> one recommendation that I made, and it's in the official records, were to have resident parking only commuters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5211.244s">Because</a> too many people from Winchester, not only some of them are coming down here and taking spots, they're leaving their trash in our trash barrels because they have to go to dump in Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5219.07s">And</a> that is totally unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5220.811s">And</a> quite honestly, it's larceny, as far as I'm concerned, or illegal dumping, because it's our taxpayers that are footing the bill on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5227.655s">But</a> it is up to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5230.237s">I</a> do see some tweaking getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5232.198s">which</a> I think people have to understand that this is slow process, similar to the trash barrel situation where I had more phone calls on the trash barrel, similar to this situation, and how many people were going to need three, four, five barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5243.545s">And</a> if you talk to the DPW, there's not many households that actually purchased the additional barrel at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5248.828s">But</a> in Winchester, Winchester is totally expanding their program right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5256.282s">as</a> we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5257.323s">They</a> just put their brand new kiosks in Winchester Center, and actually our kiosks are better. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5263.652s">I</a> haven't used one yet, but at least the numbers are bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5267.537s">In</a> Winchester, the keypad is tiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5270.272s">It's</a> tiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5270.892s">And</a> I know this, this council wanted to make sure that everything was ADA compliant and the mayor is very serious when it comes to that stuff too, as, as yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5278.158s">But,</a> um, that's, that's all I really have to say at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5281.7s">But,</a> uh, I just, what I stated regarding the initial report, pretty fairly accurate because I'm hearing different things that, that that committee never wanted kiosk meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5290.547s">But</a> now when you look at it, it's actually one of the recommendations.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5437.374s">Councilor,</a> with all due respect, I took the same exact votes in this whole program as you and every other member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5441.757s">So,</a> Mr. President, just if I could finish.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5536.965s">Councilor</a> Camuso, if you'd like to complete your remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5540.287s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5540.647s">I</a> can conclude with two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5541.788s">And</a> just to follow up on what Councilor Mack said, and I did say that after the recommendations came by his committee for all these recommendations, it was in the mayor's hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5549.573s">He's</a> the signatory authority and the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5551.814s">And</a> to say that I supported it and now I'm not, we all supported it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5556.237s">Seven</a> members of this council gave, had our- I didn't support this language.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5622.077s">Councilor</a> Camuso has the floor, and then Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5624.998s">Just</a> two last things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5626.659s">In</a> the last few days, I had several members of our community reach out to me about the signs on the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5631.16s">I</a> worked with the DPW today, as well as the Mayor's office, and all the signs have been removed from the trees, and <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5638.803s">Unfortunately,</a> I know Councilor Marks over the years, this has been something he's been a stickler about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5642.785s">But</a> some of the existing signs that were, they took down and put them over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5647.847s">They</a> were never removed in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5649.708s">So</a> shame on the city for allowing them to linger up there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5654.63s">Further</a> clarification.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5693.227s">last</a> but not least we have business owners in this community that have consistently parked their vehicles in front of their stores year after year after year and you know what the only people that suffer are them and the consumers when they pull up and they have to park three miles away because you got an ice cream store or you have a vendor <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5715.741s">I</a> mean, they don't even try to disguise it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5717.943s">The</a> name of the companies on the side of the truck that sits out there all day long, or the car that sits out there all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5723.188s">I</a> think, I think today driving through the squares, I think some of the business owners now are taking the appropriate steps to leave the spots for the consumers, like us, when we show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5738.06s">I</a> think they're already seeing an impact, because you got good business in the community, like the guys that are sitting out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5743.543s">They'll</a> go deliver some food and then park their car half a mile away so that somebody can park in front of their store. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5749.347s">There's</a> not many people that do that, I hate to say, throughout our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5752.849s">And</a> it's obvious, because half the trucks are leaded that say the name of the business and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5758.112s">So</a> that's it for now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6117.813s">Why</a> are we discussing all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6121.354s">Point</a> of information, a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6123.755s">My</a> understanding is for doing deliveries to the company or the company doing a quick pickup and heading out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6129.977s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6130.492s">It's</a> not for customers, it's a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6131.852s">But</a> the nature of a certain business, if it's one of those... No, but he's talking about getting paint shaken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6136.793s">That's</a> a customer going in and getting paint shaken up.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6143.634s">Well,</a> I challenge you to go up there and buy some paint and see if you get a ticket when you come out, because that's not the purpose of a loading zone.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7396.83s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7397.25s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7399.052s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7399.352s">And</a> Mrs. B, thank you for, for your clarification or the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7403.395s">I</a> was just referring that I said after you guys made the original initial recommendations at that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7409.695s">The</a> only person that could do anything was the mayor, because he's the signatory authority.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7420.5s">Well,</a> the committee that you were on, though, did make recommendations for kiosks and meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7424.081s">So</a> if you want the paper, I'll give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7426.142s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8649.803s">This</a> is technology today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8651.945s">The</a> City of Medford actually charges a fee when you pay your tax bills online or a parking citation currently through the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8658.611s">So</a> I just want to let Councilor Penta know.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9731.397s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9734.46s">This</a> city council asked the mayor's office specifically to have a grace period on violations and enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9740.925s">So</a> I'm assuming this is the grace period.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9745.369s">We</a> asked for at least a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9748.011s">We</a> asked for a month.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9797.098s">But</a> it's not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9797.759s">We</a> can't.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10398.609s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10399.69s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10400.991s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10401.711s">And,</a> um, a portion of that too, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10405.351s">set</a> up by this council and the administration is earmarked to go right back into community development in the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10412.175s">So</a> whether it's hiring a consultant to try to bring in more business, whatever the case, whether it's physical infrastructure improvements of a particular square. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10422.781s">So</a> this council, working with the solicitor's office and the mayor's office, we're adamant that a portion of this does go back to the business districts that are affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10433.166s">Thank</a> you, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10435.011s">Councilor</a> Penta, did you have a point of information?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10943.88s">I</a> think he's referring to the ticket writers.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10949.785s">Good</a> luck.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11018.408s">Thank</a> you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11020.549s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11022.2s">If</a> I may, this brings up a follow up question and this would be to the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11026.522s">There</a> are some traditionally we know which streets right now in the community of resident permit parking only. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11033.604s">I'm</a> assuming there's going to be a residual effect on this because now people are going to be leaving place dead road to park and they're going to be parking up the side streets and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11041.908s">At</a> this point, there's some scuttlebutt out there that there's other streets that were added as resident parking permit recently in anticipation of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11049.691s">Is</a> that true or false?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11052.05s">That's</a> false.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11122.853s">And</a> that would be up to, because I know exactly what he's referring to, the Cottage Street that I talked to you about.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11129.736s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11157.852s">And</a> then, um, my second follow up question is regarding the, uh, the streets and the permit streets for the viewing public, because there will be the residual effect like, um, some street that's not already residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11167.798s">People</a> may try to, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11169.339s">beat</a> the system, I'm not going to pay the $5 to park on Police Dead Road, so I'm going to go to one of those streets, Century Woods, Roberts, anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11179.511s">If</a> any streets see an influx of vehicles parking, they should get together and petition the community, the City of Medford, through the Chief and the Traffic Commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11187.841s">to</a> take a look at making it resident permit parking, because I know that you and the Traffic Commission, what's the official name now? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11196.912s">Traffic</a> Commission, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11197.733s">Still</a> Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11199.555s">With</a> the merging of the off-street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11202.962s">But</a> with that being said, I think people have to be cognizant of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11206.084s">If</a> you see an additional people park on your street, and traditionally you can tell when they're out of town is because they have stickers for the dump in Winchester or Lexington Boys and Girls Club or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11217.752s">So,</a> but if you see an influx of that, bring it to our attention as a city council, the mayor or the chief, and we'll get you before the traffic commission and the chief will do his due diligence.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11234.463s">Have</a> a hearing.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11247.294s">Well,</a> I'm glad I'm glad you updated the council miss because there was a lot of banter going back and forth that all half the city now is resident permit parking only that they Because of this and at this point there's only been one addition to the last one was Hamilton Hamilton Street And that was two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11262.165s">Okay</a> before this was even and for this because this is going live, can you work with the city administration to maybe get the the <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11271.221s">the</a> traffic commission's agenda on the city webpage, so people can take a look at it and see what streets around them may be affected by it, and then you can have maximum input from the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11282.547s">Thank</a> you, Chief.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12187.747s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12189.309s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuto. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12190.59s">Either</a> yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12191.671s">Not</a> to throw this gentleman under the bus, but normal person says you don't put the sign on the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12199.768s">I</a> mean, the guy's acknowledging he made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12202.25s">You</a> want to beat him up? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12202.991s">Who</a> didn't tell him? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12203.571s">The</a> chief, the police?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12206.874s">I</a> understand, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12207.795s">But</a> did you lock your car when you come in tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12209.516s">Yes,</a> I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12209.816s">Did</a> you lock your car?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12211.357s">I</a> mean, we're going volley here on ridiculous stuff now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12216.402s">No,</a> that's in your mind.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12233.543s">To</a> follow up on that, Aggie Tudin was very, very helpful in straightening the situation out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12238.046s">So</a> kudos to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12240.528s">I'm</a> not sure if she actually talked to you or someone in your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12242.869s">She's</a> our tree warden here and arborist. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12245.431s">And</a> she was very concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12248.351s">She</a> took the bull by the horns on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12249.733s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7303.901s">Mr.</a> Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7305.301s">14-472.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7306.661s">Mr.</a> Councilor, Mr. Solicitor, we had a meeting of the committee of the whole where we were presented, members were here that are in the audience this evening were at that meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7316.821s">and</a> they participated in that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7318.822s">It</a> was packed and it was in the room right over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7322.064s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7326.947s">You</a> had a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7328.348s">Your</a> point is over.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7340.816s">Name</a> and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7347.831s">doing</a> it for 30 years, maybe it's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7350.876s">That's</a> right, I have a half a brain like you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7353.84s">Name</a> and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7355.142s">John</a> Starrar, still. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7357.385s">You</a> might be right behind me, councillor, for all you know.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7389.667s">Councilor,</a> you just corrected yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7391.187s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7393.389s">That</a> we would have a meeting, nothing to do with another vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7491.305s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Torello. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7492.866s">Name</a> and address for the record, sir.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7642.734s">It's</a> something you'd have to bring up with the mayor, because we gave him the authority to sign the 10-year contract.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7655.821s">I'm</a> just being upfront and telling you the truth.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7844.098s">And</a> I'd like your point about the reverse 911 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7846.558s">Just</a> come up so the people at home can hear you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8145.484s">DJ,</a> just so you know, you are being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8149.926s">The</a> Chamber of Commerce has worked very, very, very diligently, and I think we've seen results in that with the press release that went out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8157.889s">So</a> it's not going to be $400 come January 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8161.551s">It's</a> $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8162.291s">The</a> business permit and the commuter permit is staying the same, which people already should be paying down. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8167.797s">in</a> the business lot, either that or they're parking illegally already.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8185.36s">But</a> as far as the business permit, there is no change. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8187.4s">As</a> you know, a hundred dollars up until now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8190.281s">The</a> police, as the chief said, I've been very busy with other stuff, but technically if you don't have a sticker right now in that parking lot, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8196.92s">you</a> should be ticketed and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8198.301s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8203.485s">60</a> days, as the chief mentioned earlier, this is going to be a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8207.488s">This</a> is probably very fluid, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8208.749s">Chief.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8209.67s">And</a> uh, as needs come up,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8223.775s">But</a> that's currently right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8225.476s">No,</a> I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8226.197s">If</a> your people are parking in that lot without a permit on their vehicle right now, they're illegally parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8230.9s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8231.4s">As</a> well as the businesses in Medford Square are doing the same thing as the Governor's Avalon. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8235.784s">People</a> are used to lax enforcement around here.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8261.855s">So</a> just, just so everyone knows, including yourself, all the members of the council, I think we're asked a similar question when the city solicitor and the mayor presented this, everyone thinks it's an automatic 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8275.624s">It's</a> similar to the trash and recycling program that happened when this place was filled to the rafters. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8282.228s">We</a> still heard some complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8283.789s">We</a> worked on it as we moved forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8285.811s">But</a> most importantly, there is a clause that we can get out of this by purchasing the equipment.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8291.487s">And</a> our city solicitor, as you know, is top notch.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8296.81s">And</a> if for some reason they want to overturn this at some point, there'll be a dollar value, but it can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8306.936s">But</a> tell your employees they've been lucky they haven't got ticketed in that lot without their pocket permits up to this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8326.582s">Um,</a> if I could just make one announcement from the chair to park Medford is up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8331.488s">You</a> can actually get the application on your smartphones. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8334.371s">Um,</a> it's a pretty interesting website. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8337.595s">I</a> was fooling around with it tonight before the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8339.777s">So,</a> uh,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8354.015s">Somebody</a> can go to 577 Main Street on Medford Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8360.558s">575</a> Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8361.458s">There'll</a> be a fully operational business meeting place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8365.8s">And</a> this was worked on in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8367.968s">as</a> well as the Chamber of Commerce and everyone else involved wanted to make sure that there was a place where people can go on a full-time basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8375.152s">So</a> people are actually going to be able to get the answers quicker now than currently coming to City Hall where the tax office and everyone else has been doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8382.035s">So</a> hopefully that's helpful, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8473.591s">All</a> right, we have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8476.298s">On</a> the motion for approval with the seasonal passes from Councilor Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Caraviello to look at the program 60 days after its inception, and Councilor Marks to get a listing of all the commuter, commuter residential, permit parking, if it goes into the general fund, and if not, what fund it goes to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8494.494s">Is</a> that correct, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8496.616s">All</a> those in favor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8502.888s">That's</a> what the council is stating.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8514.373s">After</a> the 30-day grace period.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8539.587s">Did</a> I say that right?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8541.367s">Teja.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8541.928s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8542.828s">76</a> 4th Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8544.508s">For</a> the Lighthouse, 20 High Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8547.989s">Chair</a> recognizes Vice President Caraviello.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8581.476s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8582.236s">Another</a> Medford resident? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8583.536s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8583.756s">Give</a> him back to his city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8584.617s">Good</a> luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8585.197s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8586.677s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8587.037s">Have</a> a nice holiday.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8625.638s">On</a> the motion for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8627.66s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8628.32s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8629.661s">The</a> ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8630.382s">Good</a> luck.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8632.924s">Also,</a> while we're in the suspension, 14-788. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8634.625s">This</a> is the appropriate funds and authorize the mayor on the grant to preserve land for public park known as the Crystal Campbell Memorial Peace Guard.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8796.955s">Thank</a> you, Lauren. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8797.515s">And</a> if I may, from the chair, we have a paper before us that gave the annual, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8803.809s">price</a> for mulching and the fountain service, and it's $3,000 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8807.911s">Does</a> the council ask for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8809.751s">And</a> then the electricity costs for the fountain to operate in the lighting is estimated at $1,500 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8815.813s">So</a> thank you for answering these important questions before the council has voted on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8820.015s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8820.415s">Councilor</a> Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8821.636s">Move</a> approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8823.896s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8824.757s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9383.821s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9771.945s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9791.331s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9811.862s">Thank</a> you for your point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10098.574s">Can</a> we start talking about tragedies though?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10185.22s">Well,</a> pick up the phone, and I'm sure you will.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10223.5s">Councilor</a> Knight, point of, no, no, go with your clarification.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10263.232s">Your</a> point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10264.292s">That's</a> my point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10265.732s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10266.072s">And</a> I'm trying to give you as much leeway as I can, but Councilor Knight has been patiently waiting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10377.773s">We</a> have a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10379.114s">And</a> we have a second motion from Councilor Marks to deduct $250,000 from the petition that's before us for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10389.318s">And</a> that is the funding from Wynn Resorts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10392.299s">We're</a> going to call that vote first. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10393.96s">A</a> yes vote is to eliminate the fountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10399.242s">A</a> yes vote will be to eliminate the fountains <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10403.349s">and</a> the $250,000 for the Crystal Campbell Memorial Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10406.992s">A</a> no vote will then bring the final vote back to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10411.595s">So</a> this is on Councilor Marks' first paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10416.82s">A</a> yes vote is to eliminate the fountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10422.504s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10423.265s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10424.946s">Roll</a> call has been requested by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10429.65s">The</a> clerk will call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10444.864s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10445.124s">By</a> a vote of three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10449.987s">We</a> now have the paper before us to fund the crystal Campbell memorial peace garden as presented by the mayor without cutting out the fountains at this site. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10462.848s">And</a> roll call has been requested, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10467.389s">Would</a> you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10469.85s">You</a> want to speak or you want?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10661.442s">Can</a> I just, I listen, I understand where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10664.343s">It's</a> a financial decision to you at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10667.144s">I</a> think everyone made their points. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10669.394s">In</a> the interest of holiday spirit and this isn't tragic, I'm just trying to do right by the body and take a vote to move forward.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10819.488s">And</a> before the roll is called, Councilor Lungo-Koehnan and Councilor Marks, but I'm glad they picked that location because it's not only going to be great for the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10828.196s">This</a> young woman lived about a hundred yards from the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10833.361s">So</a> there's some significance in my vote with that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10839.994s">Councilor</a> Lengelkern and Councilor Larkin.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as/2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as.html">Medford City Council - December 16, 2014</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=318.34s">You</a> looking to do the levy? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=320.582s">Reducing</a> the tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=321.983s">This</a> is the budget that was passed by four members of this council in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=325.106s">So</a> there's going to be a million dollars in cuts or the mayor has to submit a certified letter stating that he wants to appropriate a million dollars or your amount under free cash.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=403.407s">So</a> I completely disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=405.628s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=485.488s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Dello Russo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=651.5s">Point</a> of further information, Councilor De La Ruza.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=867.449s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn, you have the floor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1135.775s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1137.216s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1138.316s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Kerr.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1174.822s">There</a> were four members of the council that approved the budget and I was not one of them, so I can't speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1181.183s">Councilor</a> Penta, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight, then Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1426.42s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Dello Russo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1640.768s">Councilor</a> Marks and then Councilor Caraviello, Vice President Caraviello.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1903.893s">One</a> question for, and this is to move the conversation forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1907.994s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn has an amendment to the original paper here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1911.675s">If</a> the million dollar request is approved, where is the million dollars going to come to fund the budget that's currently in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1920.578s">That</a> would be certified free cash if the mayor submitted it, or would it be cuts?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1928.839s">If</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn's motion is approved to cut the levy by $1 million, where will that be made up from? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1938.623s">It'll</a> just come out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1940.063s">But</a> that would have to be submitted by the mayor requesting us to take the free cash.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1954.258s">The</a> request before us would basically be to cut the levy by $1 million and ask the mayor to submit a paper back to the council for certified free cash for that amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1964.36s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1983.054s">That's</a> going to get voted on after the main paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1986.395s">But</a> if it goes through, the only way to fund that million dollars would be through either cuts or certified free cash.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2045.066s">We're</a> sending the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2045.806s">What</a> happens if it's 2010, though, when we were negative $500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2048.028s">It's</a> not going to be like 2010 with Director Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2051.771s">Well,</a> with all due respect, we have a new governor that they're looking at 9C cuts right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2055.293s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2055.994s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2057.715s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2058.315s">Let</a> me turn you on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2059.276s">And</a> then, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2125.741s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, Vice President Caraviello was correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2128.183s">The</a> budget that was approved was not the mayor's original number.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2171.23s">Well,</a> we're all asking for a police station too, which is on the horizon, hopefully.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2182.795s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2198.926s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2298.141s">That's</a> Rep Donato and his colleagues.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2301.682s">Can't</a> have your cake and eat it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2399.163s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2400.223s">Thank</a> you, Vice President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2440.866s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2441.606s">There's</a> a motion for the first question before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2445.335s">is</a> to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2015 by selecting the minimum residential factor, which the council has historically chosen this before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2457.564s">If</a> this is, once again, the council's choice, the minimum residential factor is 0.899216 on the motion of Councilor Dello Russo for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2468.632s">The</a> clerk will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2471.675s">He</a> has a different paper that's going to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2474.095s">Your</a> paper is item 14-784. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2479.298s">Councilor,</a> we'll run this meeting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2489.284s">There's</a> been a ruling of the chair requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2492.466s">The</a> clerk will call the roll on the ruling of the chair.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2501.756s">Let</a> me turn this on so the people at home can see your behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2503.697s">I</a> think you should hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2505.018s">The</a> amendment precedes the main motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2507.62s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2507.9s">Know</a> your rules of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2509.101s">Thank</a> you, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2510.882s">Clerk</a> will call the roll on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2513.043s">It's</a> been before us for a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2514.264s">It's</a> not, uh, it's not, it's not, section 22 is not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2519.707s">The</a> clerk will call the roll on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2526.083s">Vice</a> President Caraviello, before the motion is called.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2587.811s">So</a> on the challenge of the chair, we have a gentleman that would like to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2596.877s">Name</a> and address for the record, sir.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2812.011s">Name</a> and address for the record.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2966.213s">Now,</a> if you're going to take our money... The raise is for all members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2969.495s">Seven</a> members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2970.896s">Four</a> members voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2972.596s">The</a> entire council voted for the raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2974.317s">Check</a> the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2978.039s">It's</a> absolutely true, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2982.762s">We</a> will take... We'll give you the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2983.883s">Go</a> ahead, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2984.303s">You</a> have the floor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2990.386s">We'll</a> provide you with a copy of the minutes.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3225.136s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3230.14s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3230.66s">And</a> for the record, for the gentleman that was just at the podium, paper 14-098, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3236.757s">There</a> was a motion by Councilor Marks on a roll call vote of three in the affirmative and four in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3240.58s">The</a> amendments failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3242.021s">And</a> then on the final motion regarding the increase to pay for the department heads and the city council was included. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3247.585s">It</a> was upon the motion by President Calamuso from the floor that all three readings be waived and to be ordained on a roll call vote of seven in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3256.331s">That's</a> all members of this council and zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3259.133s">And</a> it was ordained.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3280.882s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3282.582s">The</a> city auditor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3338.565s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3645.76s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3646.08s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Lengelkorn, do you have a dollar amount? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3648.662s">$1</a> million, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3651.624s">No,</a> you said $980,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3658.128s">And</a> did you calculate what the minimum residential factor is going to be if indeed this passes? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3663.792s">So</a> when we get to that vote?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3667.726s">That</a> will stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3668.827s">No,</a> it won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3669.487s">That</a> will change as well if we- No, it stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3671.989s">It</a> stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3672.59s">It</a> stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3673.411s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3689.083s">This</a> is similar to the paper she has later in the meeting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3695.494s">We're</a> going to vote on Council Lungo's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3698.336s">A</a> motion to reduce the tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3700.637s">Do</a> you want to, Council Lungo-Koehn? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3702.298s">Explain</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3703.479s">Can</a> we make a motion to table it, take your other paper, and then whatever the results of your other paper is.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3809.752s">On</a> the question where this is a money paper, this will be a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3814.854s">Clerk</a> will call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3835.12s">$1,000,000</a> and insert the other number.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6127.797s">And</a> I may add that Melrose recently just updated their policy to be very inclusive as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6133.458s">It</a> was reported today in the Statehouse News. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6135.859s">So</a> I hate to be behind Melrose, but we're right behind them, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6140.78s">Ours</a> is better. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6141.64s">Is</a> there a motion?

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=454.75s">Point</a> of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=456.503s">Councilor</a> DelaRosa.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=466.27s">It's,</a> uh, under the purview of the committee, according to the whole new petition that was established years ago.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=486.988s">or</a> the mayor, um, council Burke is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=489.929s">And</a> just for the viewing public, it was an open meeting that was publicly posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=493.051s">So</a> any member of the community, as well as city council, a school committee or anyone else could have attended.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=502.435s">Baker</a> is not here.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=512.101s">What</a> was the reason agenda item? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=513.484s">It's</a> year two of the lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=515.488s">These</a> were already purchased by the city of Medford in previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=519.216s">And</a> at this point they have to be paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=521.596s">for</a> year two of the lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=522.617s">It's</a> pretty self-explanatory.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=530.604s">No,</a> you didn't.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=532.826s">That's</a> year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=533.246s">Number</a> seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=533.587s">You</a> also asked about number four.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=540.893s">Why</a> aren't we buying? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=542.262s">The</a> city administration asked us to lease these two vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=544.983s">If</a> we recall during budget time, they talked about several trucks that were destroyed last year because of, uh, I don't know if it was actual fires or it was a very bad snow removal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=556.429s">And,</a> uh, as far as why they chose to go this route, you'll have to ask the city administration that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=571.394s">So</a> we're only going to use these trucks for one year at $26,000 each. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=574.836s">No,</a> this is the first year we're getting the two trucks for the first year payment of $26,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=578.979s">I</a> don't understand why we're leasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=585.243s">This</a> is payment for year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=587.604s">When</a> year two comes around, I'm sure there'll be another funding mechanism in place that will either be budgeted through the next fiscal year's budget or the mayor would be coming back to us for funding for year two of the lease, similar to what he did in item number four.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=624.792s">For</a> the edification, Madam President, if I may interject, it's not for one truck, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=629.475s">As</a> the agenda item says, it's for two trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=631.997s">So</a> the $100,000 is divided by two. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=633.978s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=634.598s">So</a> I don't want to be misleading to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=635.999s">OK,</a> so why aren't we buying them?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=719.957s">Can</a> we get a copy of the official minutes forwarded to the Council once they are written up, please?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=734.856s">You</a> all set Councilor Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=736.057s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=736.777s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=738.599s">Councilor</a> Lungo, Kern, and then Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=857.418s">Just</a> to keep the upfront costs low.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=876.082s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=926.397s">Stumps</a> and sidewalks has been amended to read 300 in the council paper.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=933.941s">On</a> the motion of councilor Dello Russo for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=937.122s">For</a> approval of what?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=951.615s">This</a> is one paper submitted by the administration and it has items broken down and it's broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=956.618s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=957.619s">Um,</a> name and address for the record.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1103.218s">Can</a> we take the items one at a time and just... If the council wishes, you can press us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1108.705s">You</a> can ask for a severance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1110.126s">But</a> the ruling of the chair is if the council can ask for a severance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1115.589s">But</a> as far as this paper, it's not individually going into separate accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1119.931s">It's</a> one paper from certified free cash for a specific purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1124.533s">It's</a> not actually putting it into one account to another at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1128.015s">So</a> that's the ruling of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1129.396s">But</a> if the council wishes to sever each one and there's a majority of members that want that, we certainly can do that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1150.352s">You</a> can make a motion to sever?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1153.574s">There</a> is a motion to sever, Councilor Dello Russo.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1644.129s">All</a> members of the public were able to attend the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1648.958s">were</a> able to attend the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1650.798s">So</a> let's not say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1652.619s">I</a> said some. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1653.599s">You</a> said, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1655.279s">And</a> I just corrected myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1656.68s">And</a> I corrected it for you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1659.66s">So</a> we do have rule number 20 that says any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1669.942s">The</a> councillor has requested that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1671.263s">There's</a> a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1673.063s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1673.843s">It's</a> automatic, Paul.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1678.323s">It's</a> automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1679.244s">You're</a> asked to lay on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1681.245s">No,</a> it's laid on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1682.106s">We'll</a> see that next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1682.987s">Madam</a> president. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1684.007s">Madam</a> vice director.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1686.649s">Well,</a> the motion of council Dello Russo to revert back to the regular order of business council Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1699.238s">That</a> paper has been tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1701.3s">There</a> is another paper, which 14, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1706.782s">7-4-4.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1711.025s">Mr.</a> President, members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $90,000 for structural repairs to the Carriage House, in addition to various roofing and sprinkler repairs at the Brooks Estates, a representative from M-Belt, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1727.193s">will</a> be in attendance to answer any questions you may have.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2035.01s">Ayes</a> have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2040.774s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2044.253s">Uh,</a> I want to apologize as the chair, the last paper that we're just tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2048.657s">Uh,</a> if there's a motion to bring them back before us, uh, we will entertain them this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2056.803s">Is</a> that a motion council Dello Russo on the motion of council Dello Russo to take the papers back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2062.828s">All</a> those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2065.27s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2066.031s">We</a> were under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2067.872s">All</a> rules were suspended at the time of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2070.014s">The</a> paper can be back before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2072.793s">Yes,</a> there was a vote of suspension of the rules by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2076.236s">That</a> is the chair's ruling. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2078.218s">The</a> paper is back before us if the council wants to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2082.543s">You</a> can doubt the ruling of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2083.624s">The</a> ruling of the chair is in doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2087.568s">The</a> ruling will be called if a yes vote will be to <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2093.354s">Um,</a> a yes vote will be to say that we were not under suspension of the rules and a no vote on the challenge of the chair will acknowledge that we were indeed under suspension of the rules and therefore the rules were out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2104.98s">So</a> a yes vote is for Councilor Pinter's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2108.121s">A</a> no vote is the ruling of the chair to support the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2111.723s">The</a> clerk will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2115.385s">You</a> want a question before the roll is called? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2118.306s">Well,</a> we have to find out if it's back before us first. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2120.488s">So</a> we have to rule on the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2123.956s">All</a> right, I'm going to explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2128.101s">When</a> we first opened up the order of business, a member of the Medford City Council asked for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2135.089s">All</a> members of this council acknowledged that we would go under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2138.273s">Therefore,</a> rule number 20 in every other rule of the Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2142.831s">is</a> suspended. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2143.912s">It's</a> clear as day when you think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2145.393s">This</a> is, uh, we suspended our own rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2148.095s">So</a> I actually ruled wrong on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2149.856s">Council</a> Dello Russo asked for the paper to be back before us as a result of being under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2155.32s">And</a> we're here now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2156.181s">So</a> a yes vote is to <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2160.556s">Uphold</a> Councilor Penter's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2163.278s">A</a> no vote is to stand by the chair that we were indeed under suspension of the rules originally when these papers were before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2171.584s">Yes?</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2183.773s">We</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2184.053s">We</a> didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2185.294s">It</a> was a mechanism of the rules.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2198.069s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2198.309s">So</a> ruling of the chair originally was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2200.79s">We</a> were under suspension of the rules council. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2202.431s">We're</a> going to take the vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2229.632s">It</a> doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2231.294s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2232.265s">We're</a> going to take a vote on your challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2234.727s">It's</a> simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2235.167s">If</a> we were under suspension of the rules, your rule would be valid, would not be valid. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2239.15s">If</a> we were not under suspension of the rules, then we would be standing by your rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2243.113s">The</a> chair will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2243.993s">A</a> yes vote is for Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2245.955s">A</a> no vote is to uphold the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2247.796s">The</a> clerk will call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2267.173s">We're</a> going to take a ruling on the chair, and then we're going to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2269.914s">Because</a> if your ruling is upheld by Councilor Penta, the clerk will call the roll on the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2275.795s">There's</a> going to be no debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2280.717s">The</a> debate, the point is moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2284.158s">If</a> Councilor Penta prevails, you'll be the first one to speak after the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2288.319s">Call</a> the roll, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2292.582s">It's</a> not before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2293.763s">Can</a> you call the roll?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2297.568s">There's</a> a challenge to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2299.189s">A</a> challenge to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2301.472s">A</a> challenge of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2304.075s">stops</a> debate until we take that challenge and rule on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2307.438s">We're</a> taking the vote right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2309.119s">Clerk</a> will call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2326.138s">That's</a> the proper, listen, under suspension, just call the vote, a yes vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2330.443s">I'm</a> gonna move, you know something?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2368.618s">You're</a> on your own, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2369.839s">You're</a> absolutely right.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2379.163s">It</a> hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2379.744s">I'll</a> call it as I see it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2381.705s">Councilor,</a> can we take a vote on the ruling of the chair, and then are we going to debate the paper, or it's going to be up before us next week?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2396.992s">Councilor,</a> I don't know why you would... Well, I think we all know what took place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2400.694s">Let's</a> take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2401.334s">If</a> we were under suspension of the rules... Can we just take a vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2404.755s">Because</a> we might... Oh, she had a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2409.076s">When</a> you challenge the chair, you're supposed to take precedent over everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2413.538s">Councilor,</a> what are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2414.478s">Debate</a> the whole issue and then take a ruling on your challenge? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2416.879s">You</a> can't do it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2419.98s">I</a> mean... Oh.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2434.393s">Councilor,</a> if you realize, um, if you realize lately, members of this council have been asking for a suspension of rule number 33, specifically to take agenda items out of order because of your exact point, you're an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2445.458s">You</a> should know that once you suspend the rules, it's all the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2448.42s">You're</a> suspending the rules for the item that's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2450.841s">You're</a> suspending the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2452.162s">It's</a> clear as day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2452.962s">It's</a> clear as day.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2455.283s">Well,</a> let's take a vote in the majority of members of the council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2461.24s">Could</a> you read Rule 20 again, so everyone understands it? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2464.843s">Rule</a> 20 is a very straightforward rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2468.026s">Councilor</a> Pender read it, I will read it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2470.828s">But</a> as I stated, if all the rules are suspended, that includes number 20, number 33, and everything else in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2479.976s">So</a> Rule 20, would you like me to read it from the top? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2482.778s">Well,</a> I mean, if I understand it correctly, the tables have been weak. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2488.991s">It</a> certainly does, but if all the rules are suspended, then all the rules are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2492.259s">Look,</a> if we want to table it for a week, I have no problem doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2497.151s">We</a> just did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2498.571s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2499.392s">Listen,</a> you'd be the first one to jump down my throat if I made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2503.514s">I'm</a> acknowledging that I made a mistake, and now you're still jumping down my throat.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2509.278s">Who</a> told you? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2511.059s">Because</a> when I came back in and I noticed that Tom Lincoln's paper was being talked about, and I noticed that's at the end of the agenda, I said, we're still in the suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2519.304s">So</a> that's the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2521.445s">So</a> we're going to take a vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2561.472s">Then</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2561.832s">You</a> can ask any question on the whole paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2564.653s">The</a> whole paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2565.554s">Then</a> let her come up and answer these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2567.195s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2568.035s">So</a> let's take a vote on the chair first. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2569.716s">Chair</a> for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2571.017s">Do</a> you withdraw your challenge to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2573.119s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2573.699s">Then</a> we have to take a vote on that before we proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2577.582s">It's</a> a ruling. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2578.582s">So</a> we're going to take a vote on the challenge of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2581.924s">The</a> question before the council is if we were under suspension of all the rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2587.214s">or</a> we were not? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2588.234s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2589.075s">Was</a> the paper taken up when the city council was under suspension of the rules? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2592.795s">And</a> we're going to take that vote now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2593.956s">A</a> yes vote says that we were not under suspending all the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2597.157s">A</a> no vote will be that we were under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2599.957s">And</a> we'll move forward either way.

It is, but we want to get public input from businesses and residents before we move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6788.527s">I</a> got to remind people too, not all members of the council could attend this meeting because it wasn't a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6794.628s">We</a> would have been in violation of the open meeting law if more than four members were there talking about a specific issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6801.09s">So</a> in the future, I was advised that by an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6807.471s">We</a> all met on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6812.019s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6812.499s">No,</a> it was where the council actually took action on some of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6816.282s">It</a> could constitute an open meeting law if a quorum is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6819.784s">So</a> in the future, we may want to post this as a public safety meeting or a meeting, and then everyone can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6827.689s">Councilor,</a> your next item.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6854.506s">It's</a> always been on the council agenda, though, when people had the opportunity to come down and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6858.147s">We</a> got a public outcry in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6859.908s">You</a> want to have a committee of the whole or transportation?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6864.689s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Dello Russo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6877.514s">In</a> certain instances, the construction particularly affected the move in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6882.176s">We've</a> moved other ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6883.217s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6883.957s">That</a> was one particular circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6885.898s">So</a> we'll move that to the Committee of the Whole of Transportation, whenever the council sees fit.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6905.255s">And</a> the particular location that's being proposed to, it's actually blocking an egress to a household which is set back behind Pallotta Oil. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6913.799s">So</a> we definitely want to make sure the MBTA is all right with that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6921.225s">So</a> Committee of the Whole or Transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6922.926s">Committee</a> of the Whole would be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6923.966s">Committee</a> of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6925.507s">The</a> Loading Zone? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6929.648s">Traffic</a> Commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6930.909s">They</a> have to post it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6931.649s">They're</a> the only authority that can do that, the Loading Zone.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6942.993s">Mr.</a> President, if I could mention
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7063.577s">And</a> we'll do it as an official council meeting so that it's publicly advertised and that all members can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7069.538s">Is</a> that OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7070.362s">So</a> I'd like to set that up as a separate B paper, a vote to get that proposal.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7077.688s">So</a> all the amendments, one second, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7080.21s">So,</a> uh, all the amendments referred to the appropriate authorities that Councilor Marks just, um, uh, notated the B paper will be under the jurisdiction of the council to call these meetings in cooperation with the mayor in the pertinent department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7094.441s">That's</a> the B paper, right?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7103.791s">Would</a> you like to send it to a committee or a committee of the whole?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7116.857s">Can</a> I make one recommendation? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7117.957s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7118.397s">We</a> have an intergovernmental affairs committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7121.159s">I</a> think this is a perfect one for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7122.519s">That'd</a> be fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7124.18s">And</a> then report back to the entire council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7125.701s">Is</a> everyone okay with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7128.84s">And</a> that's a B paper.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7201.478s">Hold</a> on one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7206.221s">Why</a> don't you take a seat, and we'll get back to you in one second while he looks it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7208.743s">We're</a> going to take these votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7210.043s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7210.344s">And</a> then we'll. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7211.224s">We'll</a> let her speak.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7214.687s">She</a> wants to speak on water and sewage.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7217.087s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7218.188s">Water</a> and salt. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7218.748s">We'll</a> bring it up if any counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7221.15s">14</a> dash salt. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7222.351s">Any</a> more on the South Medford neighborhood meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7232.579s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7232.78s">Senate,</a> do you have anything else at this point for the South Medford meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7236.142s">And</a> I have to say, Mr. Silva has done more public output on this particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7241.306s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7241.927s">You</a> weren't notified, but in the future it's going to be a public meeting of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7246.581s">which</a> will be publicly advertised, but they're very welcoming if you give them your contact information.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7274.993s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7275.812s">We</a> exchange information. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7276.852s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7277.792s">I'll</a> tell you, I get more emails from him than everyone in the community.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7502.593s">And</a> the only thing this can be used for is something that is directly <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7506.92s">related</a> to the water and the sewer in the community, whether it's improvements, infrastructure improvements, as well as paying the employees that are assigned to that division.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7536.385s">It</a> is the money that is brought in. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7539.707s">The</a> MWRA assesses the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7543.028s">City</a> of Medford then in turn sets the water rates through the Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7547.391s">Any</a> money that comes in after bills are paid, it goes into this account, and right now it's in a positive.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8468.606s">You</a> get that, Councilor Penta?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8480.373s">I</a> don't know where to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8482.655s">I</a> think you should go back and watch the tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8484.195s">You</a> were talking about the mathematician.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9205.297s">In</a> Massachusetts, I don't think you can charge for water a tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9208.198s">You</a> can't physically call it for the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9212.52s">They</a> can raise your rent, but you cannot charge a tenant for water in the state of Massachusetts.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9713.934s">And</a> to do- If I may, just real quick, as the Chair, I think this is going down a slippery slope where it's a political question, so I would just ask Councilors not to <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9724.54s">because</a> this body has sometimes went down this in the past, and...

Oh, I can't do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9792.097s">No,</a> no one can. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9792.718s">This</a> is a government forum, it's not a political forum.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=716.142s">Councilor</a> Camuso or Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=717.542s">My</a> light went on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=905.471s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=907.472s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=908.891s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I applaud Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=912.392s">I</a> think now more than ever, Mr. President, this is something that would be a good addition to the boards and commissions that we have that look at some of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=922.256s">As</a> we know, statutorily, under mass general laws, certain boards and commissions have the statutory obligation to act or not act on these because it falls under their jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=932.76s">With</a> that being said, though, having more citizen input, other than just having them attend the <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=938.522s">regular</a> business meetings of the boards that are tasked with putting some of these into place, I think is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=945.305s">And</a> now more than ever, Mr. President, there's more vehicles on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=949.287s">And</a> quite frankly, I think this may be a good time for the mayor to look at all the boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=954.989s">throughout</a> the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=956.89s">Maybe</a> some of them are not needed anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=959.571s">Maybe</a> new ones are needed, maybe more in technology area or other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=965.793s">So</a> at the same time, if Councilor Marks wouldn't mind, actually make it a B paper because I certainly, I understand the importance of his proposal before us to maybe take a look at all the boards and commissions and see if it's an appropriate time, Mr. President, to either add <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=984.727s">combine</a> or delete some of the commissions or boards based upon, um, uh, just today's day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=992.11s">And</a> we have many fine members that are on these boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=994.511s">And,</a> uh, if the, uh, board is no longer needed, maybe they're willing to serve in another capacity, uh, where their professionalism will be recognized and, uh, help this community move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1003.736s">But,</a> uh, thank you, councilor marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1007.417s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1007.997s">Vice</a> president Dello Russo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5435.218s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5436.359s">And</a> I certainly agree with Councilor Arena, but I think that this is something that the people that live in this community put the school committee into office to discuss these very important issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5451.49s">And</a> the voters spoke a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5457.016s">on</a> the school committee, and I think that they are the people that are tasked, excuse me, with setting the educational standards and curriculum for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5468.292s">And</a> quite frankly, this issue is way over my head at this point, and Agenda 21, Area 51, I'm not about to take a vote on any of this this evening, because quite frankly, I just, I don't have enough grasp, and it's something that I don't feel comfortable, I don't think it's fair for any councilor to take a vote on anything they don't feel comfortable with at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6544.449s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6545.45s">In</a> the heart of Medford Square, one of the cross signals that indicate for the elderly and seniors and anyone traversing the square is out and should be fixed, especially where it's the heart of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6557.178s">So,</a> move approval.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6820.617s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6821.117s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6821.837s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6822.837s">And</a> I want to just echo the sentiments of Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6826.759s">I</a> had the opportunity a couple days before Thanksgiving, I was invited to speak to the team, myself and some former players. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6835.001s">And</a> it really was just a privilege, Mr. President, because it's not just the winning and losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6840.262s">And</a> as I said to the young men that evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6844.295s">When</a> I was in high school, I had the opportunity to play in hockey and football. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6847.256s">In</a> hockey, we were actually one of the better teams in the GBL and made the tournament every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6852.496s">And</a> in football, we lost just about every game, minus maybe one or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6857.857s">But</a> the camaraderie and the brotherhood and the teamwork, it just developed more on the football field for whatever reason than it did during the winning hockey season, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6868.899s">And</a> like I said to those young men, the city of Medford is proud of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6875.378s">The</a> city of Medford is proud of the hard work and dedication that they've put into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6880.399s">This</a> city is moving forward on a new turf field for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6883.239s">It</a> reminded them that this is the last time they're gonna play a Thanksgiving Day game on grass and moving forward in that basically, Mr. President, they went out there, they left everything they had on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6896.962s">The</a> 16 seniors are moving on and they have nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6904.583s">They</a> worked hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6905.824s">They</a> worked hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6906.444s">As</a> far as the band, that was something I didn't even pick up on, but, uh, Mr, uh, Mr. Councilor is a hundred percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6915.51s">The</a> band is just as big as part of that day as everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6918.852s">So,</a> uh, in the future, I would hope that this doesn't happen.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7246.219s">I</a> would just, I certainly wouldn't be opposed to that, but I would like to see the paper that the school committee approved come before us so that we know what they're at least.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7257.307s">But</a> we don't have the official request for a funding mechanism at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7386.452s">At</a> this point, at least I'm just one member of this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7391.435s">I</a> am going to my stance is waiting for the school committee to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7396.417s">At</a> that point, we can go as citizens, if we'd like, put our input in there, and then we'll officially see the request for funding at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7404.139s">But</a> to try to dictate to the school committee what we feel should be cut out and this and that at this juncture, I just think is going backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7411.302s">But</a> like I said, I'm just one member, and I look forward to the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7417.204s">By</a> the same token, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7418.867s">Any</a> project that ever came, a bond proposal before, Mr. President, whether it was the new schools, whether it was the roof for the schools, whether it was the improvement to the lockers a few years ago, it's always the school committee requesting it from the council what their priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7434.378s">And</a> at that point we can say, hey, we think that the money could be better spent somewhere else.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7440.802s">If</a> that was the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7441.643s">On</a> the motion.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7532.803s">Mr.</a> President, are we going to be talking about the, I believe it's an $8 million proposal or the $2 million proposal that the mayor talked about phase one? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7540.425s">I</a> mean, this is where we're getting, we don't want to give the children of Medford false hopes that we're looking at doing 8 million if the school committee is only going to give us a request for two or three. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7549.986s">So</a> the, as Councilor Penter very eloquently <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7554.233s">alluded</a> to the press release in the mayor's own words. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7556.695s">It</a> was going to be public input, which I believe was done or is about to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7560.378s">There</a> was a meeting either scheduled or scheduled to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7563.421s">And</a> then the mayor went on to say it still needs the approval of the school committee, according to what the councilor just read, and the approval of the city council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7640.374s">And</a> Mr. President, I just have always been a big advocate of the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7645.179s">It</a> has spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7646.52s">They</a> elect the school committee that are ready, willing, and able to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7650.785s">They're</a> the people that are put in the role to make decisions.
