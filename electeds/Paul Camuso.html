 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2294.778s">Unmute.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2295.899s">Getting</a> used to this Zoom stuff, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2298.841s">Paul</a> Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2303.453s">First</a> of all, I want to thank Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on, you know, as, as a former athlete at Medford High School, I love to see that we're trying diverse to diversify the athletic programs and the recreational programs in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2320.246s">Just</a> a few years ago we were very lucky to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2323.208s">get</a> the recreation department into full swing, you know, and to expand it to include more diverse opportunities for Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2331.176s">It's</a> just a win-win, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2334.038s">I</a> really think that this is going to take off, you know, you look at the Barchi court, the old Italian Americans love Barchi for the most part, and a lot of other people are now becoming <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2344.608s">part</a> of that bocce league at not only the boat club, but also the new bocce courts here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2351.131s">For</a> many, many years, people would go over to the Italian club over in Malden to participate in bocce and to see bocce and now pickleball come to fruition, I think it's a great opportunity for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2362.555s">Furthermore,</a> just on a side note, we have a lot of snowbirds in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2366.557s">The</a> biggest voting blocks and the biggest group in this community, when you look at the numbers, are the senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2373.942s">And</a> to give them more opportunity to enjoy their golden years of retirement, I think you have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2379.305s">And</a> I really appreciate you making an effort to put this in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2382.587s">On</a> another side note, my mom is a snowbird, as most of you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2386.049s">And</a> down in Naples, they actually have a tournament that brings in thousands upon thousands of people that play. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2392.093s">And</a> they actually set up professional pickleball courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2394.834s">It's</a> a big facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2396.195s">And</a> three years ago when I visited my mom, I never even heard of pickleball, but it certainly is something that's taken off, not only here, but down in Florida where the retirees go down and enjoy the nice warm winters that we unfortunately don't have up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2412.759s">So</a> I just wanted to go on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2414.219s">If</a> I could too, as a former member of the council and a parent of a student in the Medford Public Schools, I think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2421.921s">I</a> used to put this on yearly when I was a member of your honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2425.542s">but</a> I think the safety audit of all the parks to make sure, especially now, because once the parks are up and running, I think you're gonna have more people out there this year than ever due to the fact of the COVID-19 situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2437.811s">So</a> if you could, somebody think about putting on the agenda or making a paper to have the parks department do the safety audit, just to go through the entire facility structures and check all the nuts and bolts so that we can prevent injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2450.34s">I</a> think it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2451.501s">no</a> win, it's a win-win for the community and we can't go wrong when we're trying to provide safety to the senior citizens and in this particular case, the youth of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2462.046s">So</a> once again, thank you to Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2466.349s">I</a> like when you guys think outside the box, you get down there on Tuesday night and you do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2471.271s">So</a> I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2473.612s">And</a> on another note, <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2475.333s">You</a> guys are showing leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2477.154s">You're</a> showing people that the country can still move forward under this devastating vaccine program that's before us now in the COVID situation by showing up on Tuesday nights and getting the people's business done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2489.161s">The</a> continuity of government has to be paramount. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2493.323s">And</a> the people that are there tonight are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2494.884s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3182.794s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3185.443s">Paul</a> Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3188.105s">Thanks</a> again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3189.986s">Just</a> I'd like to make a quick comment on the upcoming elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3193.528s">We</a> all know that with COVID and the last few election cycles, there's been some movement around the VFW is no longer a polling place, as well as some other minor moves. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3205.175s">The</a> temple, excuse me, not the temple, the American Legion. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3209.837s">And</a> I think it's important that you get the message out via all the communication <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3214.901s">that</a> you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3216.564s">Some</a> people received ballots last election that didn't put in for a mail-in ballot like myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3220.913s">I</a> actually brought that to the attention of the city clerk at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3224.159s">I</a> just think there has to be a <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3226.267s">very</a> good PR push to let everybody know what's going on, just because there's so many moving parts with COVID and the secretary of state just filed a bill for mail-in voting to become permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3237.231s">So</a> whatever direction it goes in, I just think the public needs to know, because not everybody picks up the Boston Globe and reads the papers and does all their research. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3246.274s">So</a> it's incumbent upon this city to do that aspect of notifications, I believe.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3v7haMF7rG4/2024-11-19_3v7haMF7rG4.html">City Council 02-16-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7585.195s">Hi,</a> my name is Paul Canuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7589.756s">First</a> of all, good evening to the Honorable City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7593.657s">I'd</a> just like to go on record, you know.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7597.878s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7598.958s">We</a> hear a lot lately of looking for additional ways to raise revenues and whether it's going to be a proposition two and a half or a debt exclusion by certain members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7610.261s">And</a> I'm all for things to make our city better. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7613.062s">But</a> what I'm not for is <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7615.682s">You</a> know, there's, this is a, this is, this as a proposed, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, it's going to be an additional tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7624.67s">You</a> know, I talked to my landscaper who does about 25 houses on our street, and they're talking about an extra a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars per household, because if they have to use rakes and not the proper equipment to do the job, then they're not going to be able to do it for the same price. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7640.163s">You</a> know, I'd rather see our money go towards the schools, go towards the fire department, the police department, and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7647.348s">With</a> all due respect, I think that this is an overshot of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7651.912s">I</a> think that this is going to put a burden on people that take their homes and their beautiful homes and try to make them better. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7658.657s">You</a> know, if the landscape prices keep going up, you're going to see people not getting it done because it's unaffordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7665.602s">And</a> I don't want to see that happen in my community that I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7668.528s">I</a> think this is an overstep of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7670.653s">And</a> I really believe that we should take a step back and really look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7674.97s">You</a> know, you drive by homes in this community, people can't maintain the properties as they are in some occasions, and it's not fair to the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7682.714s">But</a> with that being said, I just wanted to go on record in absolutely opposing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7687.817s">I</a> think you're gonna hear from a lot of the landscapers in the community, the DPW, and Michael Marks, you're right on target, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7693.84s">How</a> can you say that the city can do them next to Morrison Park, Placestead Park, and other parks, but you can't have your home cleaned? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7700.643s">It</a> doesn't make sense, Mr. President, but I just wanted to go on record and be against this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7705.406s">And</a> thank you for taking the time to listen to me.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_9sF78fOJr5I/2024-11-19_9sF78fOJr5I.html">City Council 06-23-20</a></h2>

President Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13019.015s">I</a> speak from my experience as a member of the school committee and as a city councilor for about 16 years here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13028.36s">First</a> of all, the budget that we received, I want to thank the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13031.921s">Read</a> it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13033.562s">It's</a> got a lot of information, a total overhaul of budgets of years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13039.867s">And</a> I'm glad that it was presented in the format that it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13043.551s">I</a> think it's a great collaboration from all the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13047.274s">The</a> narratives were great and the charts and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13051.177s">But</a> as far as the discussion that's going on regarding meeting in Zoom and meeting in the council chambers, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13061.04s">I</a> absolutely understand that there is a lot of value in meeting at the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13067.445s">You</a> know, yeah, when you have to look people in the eye on tough debates and things of that nature, and quite honestly, after watching this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13077.159s">and</a> some other meetings that are on Zoom, the decorum, the Robert's Rules of Order are in place for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13083.341s">And</a> it's a lot easier to keep an orderly meeting, I think, if you're at a public meeting rather than on Zoom, just because the technology is a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13094.385s">But</a> like I said, I do not envy any of you guys during this COVID time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13099.107s">This</a> city has stepped up amazingly, the city council, the mayor's office, the school department, everybody, to meet the needs of the people in our community with this COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13108.75s">It's</a> unprecedented, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13112.071s">And</a> I think that somewhere along the line, and I really got to credit the entire council tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13119.415s">for</a> the motion that was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13120.436s">I</a> believe it's basically for like a mediation with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13123.32s">I</a> don't know if that's the correct word to use, but Marianne O'Connor, who I've had the privilege of knowing over the years, she is a consummate professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13131.142s">and</a> as well as the members of the school committee, the council, the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13135.764s">If</a> there's a way to do a hybrid model, I think it would be the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13139.906s">Just</a> because of the fact, like you said, people can have both, you can come down there if your health allows you to, and you can also participate on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13149.81s">The</a> one good thing that I am encouraged by this evening is the participation, but <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13155.712s">The</a> name calling and stuff that was allowed to happen tonight on all sides of this issue, it's not Medford that we can be proud of, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13164.535s">We</a> should all be working together to move Medford forward in a way that we all love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13169.917s">Whether</a> you've been here for a hundred years or you've been here for a hundred days, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13173.978s">You</a> moved here because you like something in this community and it can always be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13178.052s">It</a> can always be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13180.193s">I</a> suggest, like I said, I hope tomorrow Vice President Caraviello, President Falco, with the mayor and other people can sit down and let cooler heads prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13190.318s">One</a> thing that has been frustrating on Zoom, just when I've watched it, is sometimes they have to call the roll three, four, five times to find out how people are voting and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13200.103s">The</a> technology is iffy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13202.904s">I</a> understand <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13204.714s">I</a> understand that it's a good tool, but at the same token, it's something that can... <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13210.413s">whether</a> it's a slow internet connection on a specific night or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13214.416s">Um,</a> it does, does can get challenging, you know, but, uh, for our community, for the Medford that we all love, let cooler heads prevail and, uh, let's get the budget and do it, uh, do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13226.426s">And</a> I, and I just would like to, uh, hopefully it's a hybrid if we can do it in a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13230.63s">And,</a> uh, as far as both sides of the issue, I understand, I understand both sides of the issue, but I cannot state loud enough the value of <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13240.135s">having</a> a meeting with people once it's safe to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13244.359s">So</a> I would encourage you, would strongly encourage you guys to try to do some sort of hybrid model, because this might be another year before we're out of the woods with COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13255.609s">The</a> numbers are going up and down as we see all over the country right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13259.413s">We</a> don't know where we're gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13261.495s">The</a> city has done a tremendous job getting the, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13265.59s">the</a> PPE out there and things of that nature, working with the partners in federal and state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13270.271s">But</a> we don't know where we're going down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13272.512s">So</a> people's individual needs can be met. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13275.273s">And</a> I've always been a big person for meeting the individual needs of constituents as we all are when we're elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13282.434s">But</a> if we have both, I think it would be the best because I think the decorum, most importantly, would be brought back to a place that we can all be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13293.325s">in</a> a setting less virtual, but also virtual for the people that do have health needs that may need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13300.171s">So</a> that's all I have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13302.113s">And</a> once again, just good luck with this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13304.675s">Budget</a> time is never easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13306.62s">Back</a> in early 2000, I was around when there was a serious budget crisis when you were on the school committee council, Falco, and we worked together and we did some unique things to make sure that we mitigated some of the funds that weren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13321.987s">And</a> we did that by working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13324.128s">We</a> didn't do that by the school committee and the council, not seeing eye to eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13327.129s">We</a> did that by working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13328.982s">And</a> we were able to put out a product that was good. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13331.383s">And</a> so that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13333.644s">I</a> miss all you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13335.285s">And</a> have a good night.<h2><a

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3041.347s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3042.307s">Good</a> evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3043.608s">My</a> name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3047.069s">And</a> it sort of seems like deja vu. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3049.951s">But,</a> Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3053.612s">You</a> know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department, this is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3062.396s">You</a> know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3069.158s">The</a> fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3081.305s">By</a> laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks, I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3090.247s">You</a> know, week after week, we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3097.188s">And</a> this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3101.449s">You</a> know, the former councilor just referred to the salaries that city councilors are paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3107.55s">You</a> guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3112.324s">The</a> collections this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3113.806s">I</a> know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3117.071s">There's</a> a lot of money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3118.493s">There's</a> over $9 million in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3121.216s">This</a> community is stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3122.939s">This</a> community is thriving, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3126.702s">And</a> I think it's about time that you take a hard vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3129.583s">You</a> spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3132.483s">You</a> spend the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3133.404s">Give</a> the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3139.505s">The</a> NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3145.646s">We</a> only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3151.008s">And</a> some of those are outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3152.068s">Correct,</a> Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3153.513s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3154.594s">So</a> to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3163.584s">And</a> I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3174.81s">And</a> I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3186.407s">And</a> it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3190.742s">in</a> Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3198.605s">And</a> very easily that could have came north on Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3202.987s">And</a> Chief Gilberti could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning and we could have had it going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3210.05s">You</a> know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women and also to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3216.033s">And</a> on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3220.169s">Go</a> up the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3221.23s">We</a> have a thriving cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3222.772s">They're</a> actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3229.779s">I</a> know Councilor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3234.502s">I</a> know that that's been on the plate up there, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3239.045s">So</a> there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3242.008s">And</a> I think if you wait one week, I think it's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3247.412s">And</a> here's the other thing, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3248.973s">We</a> heard the young lady over here and the Commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3258.66s">There</a> has been price quotations that have been sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3261.772s">They're</a> coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3267.197s">And</a> furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said, let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3277.806s">Because</a> the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and financing equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3283.571s">And</a> he was very, very good at his job doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3286.533s">But</a> here we are this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3289.883s">We're</a> looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3299.029s">preferred,</a> the preferred method, as far as the council was doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3303.151s">So</a> I just want to say, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3312.276s">You</a> know, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3315.558s">And</a> it's great being down here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3317.679s">And</a> thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1599.18s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1600.461s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1602.242s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1604.063s">First</a> of all, I want to thank Councilor Tarviello for putting this on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1608.525s">You</a> know, this last week's debate, there was something that we haven't seen, the enthusiasm in that room for both candidates, all Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1618.33s">It</a> was just something that we haven't seen in a long, long time in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1623.848s">You</a> know, when I first got sworn in as a member of the Medford School Committee, that was the venue when Governor Salucci was out here and he swore all of us in, both school committee and city council and mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1635.297s">And,</a> you know, it was just a wonderful place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1639.18s">And</a> I remember, you look at some of the old photographs from the swearing in in 2000, and you can see just in the photographs the upgrades that have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1649.44s">since</a> the year 2000 or so at that very beautiful place that we call the Chevalier Theater in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1659.302s">You</a> know, as we left the debate and traversed Medford Square going to grab a bite to eat after, all the restaurants were packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1669.024s">Carol's,</a> Salvatore's, the overflow was down at Bocelli's and Razo's. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1673.905s">It</a> was just something that <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1676.332s">that</a> the businesses can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1680.094s">And</a> think of the meals tax that was brought in just that evening by the influx of people that were out spending their money in the squares that not necessarily come out on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1692.9s">But</a> I mean, I'm speechless. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1697.922s">You've</a> got to just really think about what that place can be, especially the colonial theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1704.168s">is</a> owned by Emerson College now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1706.15s">They</a> just took it offline for the next few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1709.173s">They're</a> not so sure where they're going to go with the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1715.159s">The</a> BU owns a theater that <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1719.069s">Not</a> really sure what they're going to do with their theatre right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1721.651s">And</a> as the premier real estate agent in our community just said, the money's not in the theatres. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1727.475s">The</a> money's in condominiums inside these theatres. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1730.938s">And</a> that's something certainly that we're not looking at here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1735.261s">But</a> as that happens throughout New England and the greater Boston area, as the gentleman spoke earlier, there's going to be a need for theatres like ours that hold 1,200 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1747.841s">And</a> as I said, the investments that have been made there as a result of Representative Donato, who came through a few years ago and all the seats were done over, the acoustics, I believe, the organ was repaired, or is in the process of being repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1762.791s">It's</a> a lot of good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1764.412s">But</a> the night of that mayoral debate, not only the dignity and the respect that was shown for the two candidates to one another on that stage, but the enthusiasm and the Medford pride that <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1777.022s">was</a> exhumed through that whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1780.864s">The</a> restaurants and everything else, it was something that I was actually very, very proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1785.246s">I</a> went in there thinking we were just gonna see a debate and go home, but I saw a lot more. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1789.087s">I</a> saw a lot of Medford people that are excited that there's an election, are excited to participate, watching that debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1795.61s">And</a> last but not least, the first I'm hearing about it this evening is about the debate not being played. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1802.843s">They</a> made it loud and clear that that was going to be on the public access channel, I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1807.928s">So</a> if we can get an update from the mayor, because certainly I think it's very important that the debates be played just as the Tufts University events are being broadcast on the local access channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1821.459s">So</a> if we could get an update from the mayor's office on that particular piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1825.403s">And</a> also, if we could send out a thank you to the Somerville Community Access TV for coming in that evening and providing quality camera work and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1836.348s">I</a> know the sound from what I heard was a little bit off at the beginning, but they tweaked it throughout the debate, and it was just a great production. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1845.312s">So</a> I want to commend my colleague, Councilor Penta, for participating that evening, as well as our former colleague, Stephanie Burke, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1854.238s">participating,</a> because it takes two candidates to have a debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1857.239s">And</a> both of them stepped up, did something that's not that easy, and brought a lot of Medford pride to the Medford community last week.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1901.309s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1906.01s">Who</a> is saying that this event's not being played? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1908.131s">I</a> mean, they've been publicizing it that it's going to be getting replayed and replayed the beginning and Mr. Veneziano, the whole group, that was the intent from Jump Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1916.056s">Otherwise</a> they wouldn't have brought in scat and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1918.658s">Does</a> anyone know who's saying this from the city or do you have an answer Rob? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1924.662s">Do</a> you know where this is being said?

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6475.112s">If</a> I may, can we also send to the superintendent of Y is in the DPW commissioner on behalf of the resident to check the manhole covers currently at between Walcott and Woburn on high street, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6486.979s">If</a> they can do something to tidy them up so that, especially now that the snow plowing and stuff is going to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6491.142s">I</a> hate to even think about it, but within a few months, so.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7562.067s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7563.607s">Just</a> for the record, because we're talking about an individual, there was no allegations of beating anyone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7568.329s">No,</a> no, but I'm just saying.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk/2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk.html">Medford City Council - August 11, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=288.721s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to move suspension of the rules for item 15-616 and also the paper in relative to the Garden Club Commission.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=362.617s">Move</a> approval on the appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=364.678s">And</a> if we could do two papers after this that are relative to the Medford Housing Authority under suspension <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=372.843s">while</a> the representative is here.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=516.352s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=518.268s">First</a> of all, congratulations on your appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=521.51s">This</a> is the most important appointment, I think, on that board, because it brings a perspective from the tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=529.254s">We</a> often hear complaints, but I've been getting a considerable amount of more complaints recently, just to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=537.098s">Tempone</a> Manor recently just had a pretty nasty assault down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=540.719s">There's</a> the ongoing drug problems in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=546.494s">There's</a> people drinking out on the steps of Canal Street when people are traversing the neighborhood, and this is public housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=553.042s">Willis</a> Ave, all you have to do is pick up the police blotter each week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=557.617s">and</a> see some of the problems that are ongoing down there and walk on court as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=562.618s">These</a> are quality of life issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=565.658s">Quality</a> of life issues that will affect the senior citizens down here at our high rises in Medford Square, as well as Bradley Road and all the other units that are under the authority and jurisdiction of the Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=577.56s">I</a> think that the leadership, as far as the executive director and the board, have to really get involved with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=586.706s">and</a> get their hands around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=590.148s">Not</a> to get too much into specifics, but one of the situations with a recent assault, another assault took place with the same people a year or two ago, and they're still living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=604.46s">These</a> are our senior citizens and our residents that deserve a better quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=609.203s">So</a> if we could just ask the Executive Director to issue a report to us on what he's doing to clean up these housing developments, it would be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=617.77s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2430.076s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2430.757s">Um,</a> the first thing is, um, if you'd allow me just to briefly discuss the $10,000, this is money that's coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2440.563s">That's</a> going to be user fees slash money from the gardeners to cap it at $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2446.247s">If</a> they're putting their own money into this revolving account, which is not appropriated through the city budget process, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2451.455s">I</a> don't see why we should be capping it at $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2454.356s">We</a> should give them at least the $10,000, the same that the artists are allowed to spend at a bare minimum, the same that the parks and recreation has in a revolving account. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2465.76s">But</a> to limit it, I don't see that being proactive for this startup. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2471.282s">I'd</a> also like to make an amendment if the council is amenable to <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2475.293s">The</a> amendment that the city solicitor made to have the Riverbend Park not part of this, I would think it would be prudent for this council to do it for three calendar years after the start-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2489.28s">At</a> some point, they should not be running their separate and distinct operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2493.662s">It</a> should encompass under the Garden Club, I'm sorry, the Garden Commission at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2499.464s">Mr.</a> Lasky and that crew has done a phenomenal job down there, but I just have a hard time <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2505.235s">keeping</a> one entity separate and distinct in the long term in the city where everything else is going to fall under this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2514.51s">It's</a> similar to a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2515.532s">We</a> can't say, well, all the schools are going to fall under the school committee except one school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2519.789s">We're</a> going to keep that under the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2521.61s">It</a> just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2523.092s">Would</a> the city administration be amenable to a three-year phase out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2528.296s">So</a> your amendment to make it so that the Riverbend Park is not part of this, that it would not be part of this for the initial three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2538.204s">After</a> three years, which is 36 months from now, they will become part of this ordinance as of that effective date.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2577.718s">But</a> we also could put the language that effective upon its passage that that particular portion expires on a specific date, 36 months from the date of passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2586.384s">I</a> just don't think it's fair, to be quite honest, and I think that the people that are already at Riverbend Park should have the opportunity to continue, but at some point, it should encompass all of the gardens in the city.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2631.635s">Unfortunately,</a> it's, um, the paper before us is your amendment that you added. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2636.417s">Um,</a> unfortunately it's the vote of the council this evening, which will send it back to the mayor for enactment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2641.399s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, uh, I just can't, um, I just have a hard time, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2646.995s">segregate</a> in one current garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2648.356s">I</a> appreciate everything that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2650.636s">That's</a> why I'm giving them, I think, reasonable as three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2654.778s">And</a> then they'll come under the auspices of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2658.86s">I</a> just look at all the parks in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2660.681s">If</a> we take one park away from the park board and now call it a separate park, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2665.058s">It</a> just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2667.0s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2668.741s">So</a> I'm going to make that motion in whatever way it goes that we either suspend it or give them 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2676.106s">I</a> feel more comfortable doing it with the 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2678.788s">And</a> I disagree with the city solicitor in this particular matter, because language is written all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2683.212s">Matter</a> of fact, we go back to the mills tax that was done here, and we put a date on it where the mills tax would be reviewed after several years and come back to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2694.722s">It</a> happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2696.082s">At</a> the state level, the MBTA now has a control board, and it expires certain regulations within the control board, expired at a certain date upon the effective passage of the legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2707.285s">So</a> I respectfully disagree with the solicitor in this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2710.826s">I</a> think that we can do it upon its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2713.667s">It's</a> 36 months from the date of its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2716.087s">And</a> I just think it's in the equity of fairness and just doing the right thing for the future gardeners that are out there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2779.072s">But</a> the city council has the right to either accept it, amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2782.753s">We've</a> made other amendments this evening, uh, to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2786.155s">So,</a> uh, with all due respect, if the mayor's paper, um, I think there's a fairer way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2791.137s">I'm</a> going to make that amendment and whatever way my colleagues see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2794.318s">Uh,</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2795.938s">So</a> an amendment that upon the effective passage of this paper, that the garden club at river Bend park, uh, stays separate and distinct for 36 months from the date of its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2806.192s">And</a> then at that point, the 37th month, it would fall under the domain of the Garden Commission, which, and quite honestly, I hope Riverbend Park helps this commission, because they've done a fabulous job down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2818.843s">This</a> is an incentive to make the whole thing work by including them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2822.867s">So</a> I make that amendment.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4368.581s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4370.782s">What</a> the candidate for office fails to recognize is this is still public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4374.993s">And</a> this was citizen-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4376.454s">This</a> is public property that the mayor is responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4379.616s">If</a> someone falls in that garden, they're not going to the five members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4384.679s">They're</a> going to see Mark Rumley for a suit.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4395.725s">Without</a> this commission, without this commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4398.972s">There's</a> no rules in place to make sure that there's fair and equitable access to the gardens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4404.314s">Now,</a> the city has a stake at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4406.194s">If</a> someone doesn't feel they're being fairly treated, they can go down here and see Diane McLeod. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4411.356s">This</a> is fairly simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4412.417s">This</a> is something good for our community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4690.216s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4690.617s">Um,</a> I want to thank Mr. Patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4692.879s">Is</a> it Patrick for coming up, but, uh, I'm going to keep the amendment there, I think 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4698.883s">Uh,</a> and quite honestly, if this doesn't work in 36 months, the audience is going to be out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4703.227s">So</a> it's not going to, it will be moved and you guys will still operate your garden off to the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4708.05s">So</a> like I said, I just think it's the equity that has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4713.415s">And</a> like I said, I cannot appreciate Mr. Lasky and his group, what they've done up to this point, because it wouldn't be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4722.242s">But</a> I don't even remember starting a revolving account for Riverbend Park way back when, when it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4730.937s">There's</a> not even public records as far as how much money comes in and out and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4735.438s">I</a> just think that 36 months is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4738.839s">I'll</a> even, for the gentleman's sake, I'll even go out 48 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4743.56s">Give</a> them four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4744.561s">I</a> think that's more than reasonable until it all becomes one.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4751.883s">If</a> the council, 48 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4755.284s">Yeah,</a> I'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4755.924s">I'll</a> withdraw the 36 months and 48 months, which is four years from the date of its passage, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4766.019s">It</a> comes down to equity, I mean, and you can't have different organizations running different public properties when it all falls under similar data.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4847.889s">I</a> respectfully disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4848.929s">I</a> don't think this is a legal decision, as the city solicitor stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4851.932s">In</a> the past, this is more of a parliamentary procedure, which would fall under the domain of the president of the council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4858.817s">The</a> motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn... No, you didn't answer that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4865.222s">In</a> the past, clearly because this is the mayor's paper you're answering.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5108.588s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5108.808s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, I know my resolution failed, but at this point, I'm going to, in the interest of having a unanimous vote for something good in our community, I'm going to vote with the rest of my council colleagues to include the language amended by the city solicitor, presented before the body by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5128.433s">If</a> the record could reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5130.034s">It</a> will. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5130.654s">So</a> all those in favor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6848.022s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6849.003s">Just</a> real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6850.184s">This</a> program originally, I don't want to talk about the program, but the parking enforcement was initiated by the businesses and residents that couldn't get parking spots in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6860.152s">You</a> drove through the square a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6862.814s">Every</a> business owner was parked all day in front of their store. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6866.627s">Matter</a> of fact, some of them were so blatant, they had their vehicles leaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6869.751s">You</a> couldn't go in and get an ice cream, or you couldn't go in and get something to eat, or your nail's done, or this or that, because they were parked in front of their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6878.962s">I</a> think what we're losing sight of is a business permit is just that, it's a business permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6884.513s">I</a> can assure you, when the days of the Cambridge Courthouse was open, you could buy a permit, but if you weren't there by seven o'clock, the cone would be in front of the garage, and you'd be riding around, feeding the meter until midday, and then you'd come out and move your car during your breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6899.197s">So</a> a permit is no way guaranteeing a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6902.357s">I</a> understand you'd like to park in front of your place all day with a business permit on the window, and that sounds easy, but the consumers need these places to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6911.759s">That's</a> what we heard from the businesses in Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6914.704s">and</a> throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6916.885s">Perhaps</a> you misunderstood.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6921.406s">Not</a> even close. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6922.167s">You</a> want to park on the street with a business permit for as long as you're going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6925.528s">That's</a> basically what you said.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6932.65s">But</a> as I said, a business permit is a permit only. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6936.892s">You</a> can have all the permits in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6938.212s">You</a> go to Davis Square and you park behind the Davis Square T Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6944.15s">If</a> you have a permit, you have to get there early, and you have to be there in time so there's a spot available. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6948.611s">Otherwise,</a> you wait outside the garage, you see a car pull out, and then you can pull in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6952.392s">I</a> mean, I sympathize with you, but the fact of the matter is, this is where this was all generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6957.173s">It</a> was by the business community, it was by the people that wanted to utilize the squares that couldn't because of the business owners parking in front of their squares all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6964.495s">If</a> we do the simple solution that you're suggesting, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6967.573s">Why</a> don't we throw the parking out, you can park in front of your business all day, and then the consumers won't have a place to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6973.018s">That's</a> where we came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6975.622s">I</a> mean, that's where we came from.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7005.238s">Okay,</a> well that's something we can take care of, and the Chief just heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7008.639s">But</a> with all due respect, when you say I want to minimize it, that's not the case, because you're talking to someone that's father, owned a drugstore in Winchester Center for 25 plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7019.323s">And</a> let me tell you, he had a business sticker, but if there wasn't a spot available, he took the gamble, and it was up to him to either pay a ticket or go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7027.886s">He</a> certainly wasn't going home and shutting the door on the drugstore. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7030.922s">He</a> certainly wasn't doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7032.603s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, sometimes with his bad heart, he'd have to park up near Stop and Shop and walk a little bit, or he'd have to park on Church Street and walk a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7040.067s">I</a> mean, I understand your frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7042.088s">But</a> the easy solution of just parking in front of the businesses on the street, that's why we're into this over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7048.931s">Let's</a> not sugarcoat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7049.972s">That's</a> why we are into parking enforcement.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7058.216s">No,</a> you're asking to park on the street
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7124.685s">and</a> Councilor Robert M. Penta, you were afforded that opportunity, as well as you and you and you and you and you and me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7131.267s">And</a> that is the lot behind St. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7132.847s">Joseph's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7133.727s">The</a> Chamber of Commerce worked diligently with this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7136.108s">If</a> people don't want to walk across the bridge to get to their business, then I just, it's a catch-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7142.049s">It's</a> a catch-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7143.45s">People,</a> people now can get a spot when they go to the doctors in Governor's Ave and Bradley Road, but <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7150.188s">I</a> mean, this was emanated when people were parking in front of their businesses year after year with names on their vehicles.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7158.813s">Well,</a> if you see that, you should be calling the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7160.674s">Or</a> call me, and I'll call the police.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7166.518s">Well,</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7167.659s">That's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7168.479s">And</a> I know you were conversing with the chief out there, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7171.021s">Did</a> you tell the chief that?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7172.822s">Yeah,</a> because I understand you, in your business, you've got to carry probably briefs and things of that nature, boxes to court.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7184.609s">I</a> wish I did, but I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7186.47s">And</a> listen, I sympathize with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7187.831s">But</a> at the same token, it was the Chamber of Commerce and the businesses that pushed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7191.974s">Believe</a> me, this is what we all hear the calls about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7194.716s">There's</a> a happy medium out there somewhere.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7198.439s">And</a> I'm here to advocate for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7200.281s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7201.802s">But</a> with that being said, the mayor, as you know, is the contract negotiating authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7209.189s">You</a> should be speaking with him regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7211.21s">We</a> can bring the message.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7217.153s">Well,</a> you being a former elected official should understand that the council is a legislative body and not the administrative authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7224.076s">It's</a> tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7224.636s">We're</a> not the executive in in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7227.057s">I</a> know at least one candidate has a plan for parking that was in the newspaper a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7232.9s">So</a> we'll see what happens in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7234.201s">But</a> at least for now, I would suggest that you contact the mayor's office and <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7239.294s">to</a> demand to see him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7240.535s">You</a> pay enough in taxes.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8159.914s">The</a> rules clearly state that commuter parking, now Councilor Marks brought up a very valid point that they may be selling them to out-of-towners, but according to the policy and the rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8171.158s">100%</a> of commuter passes are Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8174.459s">And</a> to take their parking privileges away, I don't support that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8180.661s">At</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8181.062s">It's</a> a thought process.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8427.178s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8427.618s">And,</a> uh, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8433.183s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8438.107s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8439.688s">And</a> I got to agree with Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8443.792s">I'm</a> looking at this realistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8446.495s">I</a> don't have to yell and scream about it because it's not a campaign year for me, unlike everyone else that's sitting in this room tonight, a lot of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8453.258s">I</a> look at it and try to look at it realistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8457.861s">A</a> year and a half ago, at four in the afternoon, if I wanted to go and take my son for an ice cream in Medford Square, I wouldn't have been able to get a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8466.985s">I</a> would have drove around four or five times. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8469.587s">I</a> think that's realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8470.787s">I</a> think most people agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8472.808s">People</a> are nodding their heads in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8475.725s">I</a> look now, a year later, with the inception of this program, I can't remember the last time I had to drive around to go get that same ice cream at four o'clock in today's parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8491.376s">Is</a> it culture shock, having to pay to park in the city of Medford, which hasn't had meters since the 19, I'm not even sure what year, but you look at the old photos, they had them in Medford Square in front of Stagliano's liquor store, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8504.213s">Sure</a> Pharmacy at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8505.354s">They</a> came out in 1982. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8506.275s">They</a> came out in 1982. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8509.097s">So</a> from 82 to 2014, it slowly built up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8514.282s">And</a> there wasn't a need for it in the 90s because there wasn't as many cars on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8518.706s">There</a> wasn't as much cars in each household. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8523.29s">And</a> the development has been more throughout the city too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8526.192s">Not</a> particularly in the squares, but on the outer edges of some of the areas, there's been more development. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8533.306s">Other</a> than paying to park in the enforcement piece, I think the consumers are happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8540.351s">I've</a> got to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8542.592s">Other</a> councillors may get 200 calls about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8546.435s">I</a> haven't got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8547.295s">At</a> first, it was culture shock. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8548.876s">I</a> was getting the calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8550.257s">I</a> was getting the calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8551.558s">Matter</a> of fact, I'd like to see someone's call log. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8557.046s">Someone's</a> call log of all the calls they're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8559.307s">Black</a> out the names, because I quite honestly don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8562.167s">I</a> don't believe when people are saying they're getting 200 calls, 300 calls about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8565.608s">It</a> doesn't add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8567.488s">It</a> doesn't add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8569.209s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I understand people are still getting used to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8574.49s">And</a> I understand that wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8577.191s">But</a> when some businesses say they're down 8% to 12%, I have other businesses <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8584.052s">So</a> I have no reason to not tell the 100% truth, that say this is the best thing that ever happened to their numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8593.475s">Now</a> we may shop in different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8595.475s">Maybe</a> some people tell me what I want to hear, tell another Councilor what they want to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8599.096s">But</a> I'm telling you, I have been told this by businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8601.857s">I'm</a> not making it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8603.017s">I'm</a> not making this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8605.358s">The</a> fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8607.603s">This</a> is more consumer-friendly in one aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8610.045s">It's</a> not consumer-friendly because you have to pay now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8612.526s">It's</a> not business-friendly because you can't park your car in front of the business all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8616.188s">But</a> there's also businesses out there that are happy with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8619.77s">They're</a> happy with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8621.592s">This</a> chamber has not had over 50 people in it in one night regarding the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8627.335s">Hasn't.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8628.236s">Hasn't.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8628.836s">We</a> have a city of 60,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8631.197s">60,000</a> people live in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8635.622s">If</a> the councillors get the 300 calls that they say they do, if they actually get 300 calls, God bless them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8641.766s">It's</a> still less than 1% of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8645.549s">It's</a> still. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8646.79s">So,</a> like I said, I just, I don't hear the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8650.132s">I</a> hear the young, and it's funny too, because the same people, and I bring this up when the drive-throughs come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8658.327s">The</a> same people now are stopping at these businesses because there may be parking where before they'd drive an extra three miles, drive by two Dunkin' Donuts or two banks to go to the one with the drive-thru because they couldn't find a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8668.069s">They</a> didn't want to get out of the car and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8669.949s">I</a> mean, so obviously there's some people that are happy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8674.11s">There's</a> some people that are not happy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8675.85s">But</a> that's just through my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8677.571s">I</a> mean, I'm given a fair synopsis of what I see out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8682.432s">I</a> haven't heard the <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8683.918s">I</a> mean, I can give you probably 50 emails of people that have complained about it over the six or seven months, but I'm just going by what I've experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8693.403s">And</a> like I said, I don't have to give a speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8697.124s">I'm</a> retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8697.745s">I'm</a> off into the sunset. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8699.206s">Good</a> luck to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8701.026s">I'm</a> just telling you what... I'm just... <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8706.873s">Well,</a> with all due respect, Val, Val, we're cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8709.214s">I'm</a> not even going to get into the parking lot mess over there in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8712.554s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, with that being said, Mr. President, I'm giving a brief synopsis of what I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8723.397s">And</a> it's just one city councilor out of seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8727.358s">And</a> I know there's other councilors here that have <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8731.196s">Got</a> some of the same feedback because people have told them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8733.978s">And</a> I'm not going to put them on the spot because it's not fair to do that if they don't want to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8738.121s">But</a> there is people out there that are very happy with this program, as well as not happy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8745.906s">But</a> more, I get positive feedback.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10799.309s">Yeah,</a> rather than, and I can understand where the council is coming from, but I don't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10805.391s">I</a> would rather have that million dollars in the bank <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10808.171s">collecting</a> interest for the taxpayers, knowing that it's encumbered for a specific reason, which is the repayment of the loan, but at least have it in an interest-bearing account, which it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10822.215s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_F9Dj7AZRD7I/2025-03-21_F9Dj7AZRD7I.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 30, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=73.553s">Mr.</a> President, move suspension of the rules to take three papers combined, 15-562, 15-563, and 15-568, and they all pertain to the Craddock Bridge construction project.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2840.815s">No,</a> you're insulting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2968.831s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2970.352s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2971.809s">My</a> first question is, is there going to be the temporary construction trailer up where people can actually take a look at the plans? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2978.072s">And</a> there's people at home now that couldn't be here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2980.613s">Do</a> you plan on doing that or not?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3019.973s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3023.276s">Excellent.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3025.538s">Now,</a> uh, I've taken upon myself to go to other communities that similar projects were done to see what the impact was on the downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3032.684s">Uh,</a> one in particular was the town of Winchester, uh, similar project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3037.127s">And</a> it took about two and a half, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3039.229s">And</a> it got cut down to one lane, most of the, um, project and, uh, the businesses, other than the fact that it was a pain in the neck to traverse the area, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3048.087s">with</a> police detail, stopping the traffic, that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3050.608s">They</a> said as far as the impact on their businesses, they really didn't see much. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3055.65s">Just</a> the ones that I happened to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3058.152s">With</a> that being said, are there any projects that you've done similar to this one in the general vicinity?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3089.201s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3090.342s">Um,</a> the second thing, um, I have a question about is the, uh, the maritime conditions and the locks and things of that nature because, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3098.655s">The</a> boating community is concerned about the locks being opened and manipulated for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3105.277s">Do</a> you know if there's going to be an impact on the riverway, as far as that goes?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3113.359s">No,</a> not the locks here, but the Amelia Earhart Dam. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3115.9s">Is</a> the water level going to stay the same and everything, or are they going to?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3145.614s">And</a> that leads up to my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3146.955s">The</a> DCI vote can certainly help out your cause by slowing the flow up at the upper and mystic <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3153.222s">lakes</a> because that's brand new. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3155.424s">It</a> was done over in the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3157.425s">Members</a> of the DOT that are here, I'm sure, are familiar with that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3162.088s">So</a> it's actually good that that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3163.91s">And</a> interesting enough, the Winchester Bridge was a result of some of their downtown flooding problems as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3171.435s">So</a> there's a lot of moving parts to this whole project that we don't necessarily see. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3176.148s">The</a> other thing is I'm confident that the direct abutters will be appropriately represented given the fact that you're putting the monitoring systems in. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3188.593s">And</a> I would hope that they all take part in it and have an independent insurance person take a look at their conditions prior to this process starting. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3199.637s">And</a> last but not least, Councilor Pentland hit on it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3203.162s">but</a> the environmental impact on the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3206.904s">We</a> have a lot of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3208.064s">As</a> you said, the city has water lines under there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3212.306s">Is</a> there going to be any negative environmental impact during demolition? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3216.988s">Is</a> there going to be booms set up and everything that contain everything right there, or netting under the bridge that's going to catch stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3222.63s">What's</a> in plans?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3263.078s">We're</a> going to lift these large pieces right out and set them on a truck and take them away. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3268.522s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3269.262s">And</a> at any time does this job call for a barge under there as well to either rebuild or demo?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3292.014s">My</a> last question is just to follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3294.476s">Actually,</a> from the drawings and the research that I've done with this particular project, going under the bridge there, it actually looks like it's going to be a lot better. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3305.162s">Naturally,</a> it's going to be more aesthetically pleasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3307.52s">but</a> it's going to be more open and voluminous when you're on the west side of the bridge looking down river towards Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3318.486s">It's</a> actually going to improve the image in the sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3321.408s">And</a> I know that's a very, that's a big area where a lot of people throughout the community utilize to take pictures, whether it's wedding pictures, this, this, this and that type thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3328.632s">And</a> it's, it's more open right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3331.674s">People</a> that haven't seen it or been up close. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3334.548s">There's</a> only a small area where boats go through and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3338.07s">It's</a> going to be like the Longfellow Bridge almost, but much smaller, naturally, the arches.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3351.537s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3354.859s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3355.659s">And</a> last but not least, I know this is very nerve-wracking for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3360.802s">I</a> mean, the traffic the last two days has been <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3364.044s">very</a> bad, but that was because of the Winthrop Street project going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3367.027s">That's</a> because, um, this project that's, that's just getting underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3370.991s">But,</a> um, I, I tried to look back to some of the complaints, um, that the city received years ago when they did the route 16 bridge over down near metal Glen mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3381.261s">And</a> that was a bigger bridge and, um, it actually took, uh, took a substantial amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3387.867s">But,</a> uh, overall, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3391.075s">It</a> wasn't directly in the business community, but it was close enough that it could have an adverse effect on the Metal Glym Mall and Century at the time, and Mystic Valley Tower was north. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3400.079s">But</a> it was pretty good overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3404.321s">And</a> that was the Department of Transportation slash DCR joint venture at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3409.124s">So</a> I'm confident that if we all work together that this can be done, and it has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3417.387s">And</a> that's the part that <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3419.013s">people</a> are failing to realize throughout the square and throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3422.494s">If</a> this doesn't happen now, the price is just going to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3426.476s">And</a> inevitably, there could be someone resulting in injury or fatality down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3432.179s">I</a> mean, when they're putting up yellow caution tape for people not to walk over a bridge, something has to be done or cordoning off certain areas of a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3441.102s">But</a> this is being done for public safety and no other reason, quite honestly, because I know the state wouldn't want to be spending the money either. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3447.558s">if</a> it didn't need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3449.439s">But</a> I want to thank you for your presentation and look forward to working with you on this project.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10999.081s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank you as well as Mayor McGlynn as he presents his final budget to the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11008.587s">Once</a> again, this is a budget that is going to provide city services at a level that I think is sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11016.832s">I've</a> been a member of this council when times were really, really tough and when times were really, really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11024.376s">Right</a> now, we're basically at a point or a juncture that <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11028.069s">Things</a> in the city are moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11030.571s">And</a> I'm proud to say that that was a collaborative effort, Mayor McGlynn and the city council, the school committee, the superintendent, and all the magnificent department heads and employees that we have here in this very building. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11046.741s">But</a> as I get ready to vote on Mayor McGlynn's final budget favorably, and I'm only one of seven members, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11055.818s">One</a> thing that did stick out to me was the statistics on the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11059.96s">And</a> it looks roughly about there's about 34 to 33,000 transactions at the meters throughout our community a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11070.885s">And</a> that's a pretty impressive number. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11076.008s">And</a> when you go to look at the citations and the citations collected, the number seems to be going down in the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11083.298s">And</a> I think that's another interesting piece of data that we were presented from Mayor McGlynn and his staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11093.997s">With</a> that being said, this is a good solid budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11097.899s">I'm</a> very, very happy that the mayor agreed with this honorable body and funded the substance abuse prevention coordinator for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11108.303s">I</a> think it's a position that is much needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11112.624s">I</a> think everyone on this council supported it when I first brought the idea forward and the mayor took it to one <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11122.523s">One</a> step further, another level, and he made it a full-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11126.006s">So</a> certainly, I'm proud of that, and I think that that's a legacy on this entire council, because we initiated it here, and hopefully it's going to be a position that turns out to be a lifesaver when people are ready to utilize the person that's awarded that job in the very near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11145.901s">But</a> with that being said, I think the school department budget is a very solid budget, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11150.345s">The</a> superintendent pointed out <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11152.83s">the</a> money that's being spent in maintenance and in repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11157.453s">The</a> superintendent also pointed out that the lump sum checks or the lump sum raises that some were saying were $60,000, a significant amount of money, were actually bonafide employment opportunities where people took new positions, is that correct, superintendent, that were publicly posted and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11179.397s">So</a> just to clear up some of the confusion on that, because I get some phone calls from people in the school department saying, where did these jobs that are referred to on TV, where are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11191.905s">And</a> so I'm thankful the superintendent gave us that in-depth report as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11197.729s">But</a> like I said, I think that this is a solid budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11201.911s">I</a> was prepared to vote on this budget last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11207.12s">after</a> the final budget deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11209.382s">But,</a> Louise, you did a fabulous job on your first budget, your first of many budgets, hopefully, here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11216.528s">Either</a> that or you'll be doing purchasing, I guess, because you have your contract as our purchasing agent for the next several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11223.113s">But,</a> like I said, we're at a juncture in our community right now, Mr. President, where we're, in a very short period of time, the faces and names of <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11236.236s">A</a> lot of elected officials in this community are going to be changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11239.679s">That's</a> factual at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11241.82s">And</a> it's really a good opportunity to keep the city stagnant and moving backwards or forward or wherever the voters may see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11249.986s">And</a> with that being said, I think that this is a solid, solid budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11254.91s">And</a> I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11256.151s">And</a> hopefully it gets voted on favorably. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11259.293s">And</a> the personnel throughout the community can get back to work tomorrow knowing that the budget is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11266.809s">And</a> I really don't have anything else to say about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11270.09s">But</a> I want to thank the department heads, and particularly Louise Miller, Superintendent Belson, and Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11277.653s">You</a> know, he's been around, and this isn't a Mayor McGlynn, Ra-Ra speech at all, but he's been around when times were tough around here and when times were good. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11286.236s">And</a> the city services were always a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11291.598s">And</a> the city services, where they are, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11294.52s">28</a> years ago and a lot added and not cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11299.942s">So</a> for that, and it was really good to always support a budget too with no trash fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11306.925s">Like</a> our neighboring community of Malden, we were still able to get through another budget cycle without that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11311.407s">So</a> there's a lot of positive stuff happened over the past couple of years under Mayor McGlynn's watchful eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11319.771s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12344.936s">These</a> are all proposals that were brought <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12349.564s">through</a> the chain of command, and ultimately the decision was made with Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12354.526s">If</a> he wanted him in the budget, he would have put him in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12360.249s">This</a> is, and just, I'm going to wrap up, but it's kind of ironic because the council wants to keep adding to the budget, adding to the budget, adding to the budget, but every time we have a paper before us to add something good, he votes against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12374.375s">So</a> it's, it's just, I'm finding it kind of ironic right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13424.006s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13427.368s">I</a> assume, as in years past, this will be funded out of the water and sewer account with a vote of the Council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13435.974s">This</a> is very much done. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13437.616s">It's</a> rudimentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13438.436s">It's</a> done all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13439.757s">It's</a> been done in years past.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13552.0s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13553.86s">One</a> thing that anybody that's a good manager would look at at this point would be if there's been any changes in the system that we've used. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13564.362s">And</a> there's been a major change. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13566.123s">as</a> a result of this council advocating for a tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13570.766s">The</a> tiered rate system started how long ago?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13577.731s">So</a> that's, I'm assuming where we don't know where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13583.635s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13584.156s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13585.127s">And</a> that's a direct result. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13586.307s">But</a> this is Management 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13588.128s">This</a> is something that we have to learn from this because we don't know at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13592.55s">We</a> don't know at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13594.01s">So</a> I'm very comfortable knowing that we've funded this in the past out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Accounts, which has certain regulations and standards that the money can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13605.434s">And</a> this is certainly an appropriate use when necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13608.575s">But</a> to say that it's 117, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13612.83s">I</a> assumed right off the bat it was because of the tiered rate system, and that's why I wanted to pose the question to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13620.853s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13664.836s">And</a> we only have authorization to cut the budget, not line items.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13748.128s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, this particular line item, I don't feel comfortable reducing it at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13758.475s">That</a> money that's in the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13760.773s">could</a> be used at a later time for other accounts if the city council sees fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13767.317s">Money</a> from the water and sewer enterprise accounts could not. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13770.199s">So</a> let's say we have another real bad year, like we've had this last winter, where the snow and ice was outrageous, just based upon the climate that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13781.346s">Right</a> now, when it's in the budget, it can be used to offset the snow and ice, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13785.809s">It</a> cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13786.809s">It</a> cannot, even if it's the budget line item.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13812.224s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13812.524s">So</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13814.345s">I</a> had the wrong understanding on the budgeted side of things compared to the account that the money is in. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13818.907s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13819.368s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13820.773s">It</a> was, I apologize for misspeaking on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13824.234s">But</a> with that being said, I still, the tiered rate system, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13829.775s">We've</a> advocated strong for it, this council, and we may have to make up money on the water side because of the assessment with this new tiered system. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13838.337s">I</a> mean, we got the answer from Mr. Kamara, who gave us a very detailed response last week in our packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13845.378s">So</a> I'd just like to sever those votes, that's all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14461.345s">He's</a> going to cut the budget and then vote against the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14470.401s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14472.643s">Couldn't</a> run a lemonade stand.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14501.567s">A</a> yes vote is to strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14504.088s">A</a> no vote is to leave it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14505.508s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14505.768s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14506.169s">I</a> just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14507.569s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14507.629s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14508.57s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14509.33s">Councilor</a> Caraviello?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14529.819s">What</a> was the roll call on that, on the first item? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14532.96s">4-3.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14534.561s">4-3,</a> and it failed?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14609.382s">Thank</a> you for all your hard work.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14721.472s">This</a> is the outreach coordinator.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14725.408s">We</a> just voted for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14727.209s">We</a> got it earlier today.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14730.692s">Well,</a> maybe you just didn't keep up to the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14732.913s">I</a> just got it tonight, Paul, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14734.674s">Well,</a> we all got it earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14736.415s">You're</a> the only one that always has problems.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15142.838s">It's</a> already in the budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15174.322s">We've</a> all been advocating for this, putting it off for longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15177.204s">I</a> mean, the overdoses just keep going up and up and up in the city.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15185.267s">Hey,</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15186.588s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, it's a position that we all advocated for.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15259.637s">Council</a> has been sitting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15266.503s">June</a> 16th, we've been sitting on it, dishonorable bodies since June 16th.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15292.637s">But</a> we don't approve job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15294.878s">We're</a> overstepping our boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15297.3s">Job</a> description is administrative role. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15300.202s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15300.822s">If</a> you guys don't want to support it, don't support it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15304.845s">There's</a> a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15306.065s">Yeah,</a> that's the only role we have is putting it in their classification personnel table. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15315.945s">Take</a> the vote if you don't want to support it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15433.246s">Of</a> course it can.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15441.588s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn asked to this be tabled until we got the description. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15449.469s">That's</a> how we're at now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15519.264s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15520.545s">As</a> we all know, the city- I have a point of order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15525.707s">Talk</a> about it next week.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15531.65s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15536.052s">Mr.</a> Villion won't have his TV station.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15885.779s">I</a> don't know if the Councilor may have forgot, but didn't we as a council vote on a moratorium for this particular reason?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16148.366s">Mr.</a> President, while we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16150.846s">While</a> we're under suspension, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16152.827s">I'd</a> like to take 15-424 and talk about community access.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16171.991s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16172.992s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16175.671s">As</a> we all know, we're getting the new Medford TV station up at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16180.694s">And</a> it's going to be pretty exciting that the city is going to be moving forward finally over the next nine months or so with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16192.588s">And</a> if we could just ask the school department to get an update, not on the building, because I'll speak about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16199.172s">That</a> was section 22 a few minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16201.914s">But</a> I would like to ask the school department to see where they're at as far as getting the station up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16207.978s">I</a> know it comes after the construction.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16211.26s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16229.799s">And</a> I certainly agree with Councilor Marks, because there's going to be people that can't go to this station because of their quarry, because it's in the school, where if it was in Medford Square or somewhere else, it might not eliminate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16239.746s">But</a> with that being said, if we could get an update from the school department on how's it going and who they plan on putting in charge of it, and just basically an update on the new station.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16279.118s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16280.458s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Poulos. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16284.1s">It's</a> not on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16285.32s">The</a> paper that was section 22'd a little bit earlier was to get an update on the moving forward, but we can't talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16292.503s">So</a> it's not on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16293.283s">That's</a> incorrect.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16314.926s">A</a> developer wants to go up there, you said? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16317.867s">I'm</a> confused.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16554.997s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16555.658s">Thank</a> you very much, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16557.158s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16558.059s">I'd</a> just like to remind the viewing public that it was Councilor Penta that fought the charge to shut the access station down. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16564.462s">So</a> it's kind of ironic, once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16568.918s">There's</a> many emotions he brought forward, and the record doesn't lie.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16609.44s">Mr.</a> President, if I may just conclude, as I stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16613.711s">The</a> Councilor wanted to get rid of public access and now he's a proponent.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16637.598s">We</a> don't need personal tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16640.119s">You're</a> on your last leg here, councillor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16648.924s">It's</a> only begun.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16850.158s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16852.82s">Before</a> you read the records, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16855.042s">Yes,</a> Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16857.003s">I'd</a> like to wish a very, very happy 40th anniversary to our council colleagues, Adam Knight's parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16866.855s">excuse</a> me, Dee and Jerry Knight, 40th years of wedding bliss and marriage and two great kids, grandchildren, and I just want to wish them well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16876.799s">Happy</a> anniversary.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_V22AEle-x6o/2025-03-21_V22AEle-x6o.html">Medford City Council - April 28, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1731.121s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1732.802s">And</a> thank you very much for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1735.567s">Certainly,</a> I think this is a very fair and equitable plan that gives much needed funds to the human service community that directly gives a positive impact on the families that utilize them on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1749.37s">So</a> I am in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1750.69s">I'd</a> like to move approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1752.69s">And</a> if I could just ask one question, just because there's a little, it's a little bit off topic, but I know Lauren's been handling it and it's not putting you on the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1760.832s">The</a> anticipated <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1762.513s">completion</a> of the Christopher Campbell Peace Guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1764.254s">Is</a> it this calendar year or next calendar year? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1767.034s">Do</a> you know?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1794.234s">And</a> the reason I ask that is because I think it's a very good project. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1798.737s">And</a> I was under the impression that it was going to be this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1802.901s">But</a> as we approach May, construction-wise, I just wasn't sure that we could get it done.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1846.634s">And</a> I'd like to recognize Council President for giving me the leeway to ask that question, because I know some people were asking, and as we got later in the year, didn't know if it was actually feasible to get it done by the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=1856.477s">So,</a> yes, thank you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3399.355s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3400.275s">So</a> a request for roll call on the motion for approval and sever the question of the 15 grand. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3407.32s">The</a> sever has to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3409.681s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3411.883s">I</a> just, I'm for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3412.924s">And</a> if I can state, I have the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3416.226s">This</a> is for the Alfonso Caro Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3418.908s">It's</a> the common area of that development, and it's where most of the things take place down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3425.772s">It's</a> where election day is held. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3429.314s">So</a> this is definitely a common area, and this is where you're going to get the best impact for the best dollar, and I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3439.16s">The</a> improvements that were made over the last few years were significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3441.601s">There</a> were squirrels and raccoons living in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3444.066s">prior</a> to the last improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3446.387s">So</a> I certainly do support this as a quality of life issue, and it's coming from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3452.689s">So</a> rather than get rid of it, I'd rather see it funded here than in Milwaukee or Nevada or somewhere else that we'll be putting in for funds as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3523.303s">Present</a> a question please to the council, and yes, vote is one 15,000 stated or?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3562.81s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3563.691s">The</a> only other way, I see Councilor Pinter's point, but the only other way would be taking a yay or nay vote on the entire paper as approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3571.419s">And</a> from listening to the council, I don't think that the votes are there to take the $15,000 away from the Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3580.147s">So</a> in essence, if we vote yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3583.847s">as</a> it, as it's on our agenda, it's approval for the whole paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3587.27s">That's</a> so I was doing the sever out of respect for you, Councilor, so that we could take a separate vote on that piece.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3761.014s">Point</a> of information Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3762.734s">Um,</a> in all due respect to Councilor Penta, that may be the druthers of one councilor, but there may be other councilors here that are in, in, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3772.715s">favor</a> of it as presented so that the $50,000 that's non-encumbered right now for a specific purpose can be utilized for the senior citizens within a development and not necessarily that development. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3784.984s">If</a> we fund this money, some of the federal money can be used at other developments in the city.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3805.16s">And</a> if they do get money, and it's more than anticipated, they can do an additional project down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3810.081s">And</a> quite honestly, Walkland Court's a lovely community, but it's probably the building that needs the most upgrades out of them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3818.823s">And</a> that's from walking and traversing in all of them over quite a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3823.306s">So</a> I understand where the council is coming from, but to have the OCD director do that, when it may not be the druthers of the entire council, if he wants to do something like that, then let's take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3834.203s">That's</a> basically all I'm saying.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3845.034s">If</a> the members of the council, once again, support asking that question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3851.28s">Because</a> I know that over the years, that has been one development that has <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3856.925s">for</a> lack of a better word, not receive some of the other upgrades that other developments have. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3861.488s">You</a> go down here to 121 Riverside Avenue, they spent a lot of money in the lobby over the years, they spent a lot of money in the grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3870.773s">Now</a> I understand some of them are federal and some of them are state buildings, but the one you hear the most complaints about is Walkland Court.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3903.975s">That's</a> a long-term plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3906.717s">And</a> very well possibly in the future, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3909.919s">It</a> could be something where, with the Green Line coming into that particular area, that there may be other housing options where they can build a new development somewhere else within our community or in a neighboring community that's state-funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3924.598s">than</a> possibly a whole new development. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3926.879s">I</a> mean, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3927.699s">That's</a> going to be a hot area.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3932.24s">Precisely.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3937.681s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3938.161s">And</a> that's what's keeping the units affordable.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3949.664s">The</a> president administration is another six months.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3969.082s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3970.103s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3971.804s">I'd</a> like to ask the council, where the post office in South Medford is. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3974.367s">I'm</a> not familiar.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3977.126s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3977.366s">The</a> hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3977.806s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3978.026s">I</a> was thinking more South Medford square.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5986.419s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5986.919s">And,</a> um, you know, I, I certainly support this this evening, but, um, I think this council has been very supportive of the arts, uh, just within the last few years, the line item that was offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5999.683s">for</a> arts in our community was put into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6001.984s">I</a> believe it was $25,000 at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6004.686s">And</a> it's something that we've made sure that it was put in year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6009.909s">Now,</a> I look back a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6012.67s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6014.491s">I</a> look back a few years ago, and at the time, it was President Stephanie Muccini-Burke who was the chairperson of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6020.614s">And</a> we did have a proposal for an art center here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6024.777s">And</a> the only three councilors at the time that supported it, for whatever reason, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6029.404s">was</a> Councilor Carr, Councilor Marks, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6033.067s">Now,</a> all the councilors have their own reasons why they didn't, and I respectfully understand their reasoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6038.652s">But</a> there's been proposals over the years that have come up, so to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6044.537s">But</a> with that being said, as Councilor Caraviello just stated, too, I think, and I brought this up in the past, I think the Chevalier Commission has to look in the direction, too, of allowing <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6054.852s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn mentioned a few minutes ago about having a nice movie with popcorn and sitting down with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6060.056s">But</a> unfortunately, unless you change your rule, popcorn's really not allowed in there during the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6065.26s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6067.121s">Correct,</a> yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6068.858s">Yeah,</a> right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6070.039s">So</a> right there is part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6073.301s">Concession</a> stands is what's keeping Lowell alive a lot, as well as Lynn, because people are going up to the concession stands, and they're buying a 12-ounce beer for $5, and it's costing the place a nickel. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6086.53s">So</a> the city has been supportive over the years of putting some ideas and stuff out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6092.794s">And</a> the management company, and I understand, you're in a commission role. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6097.917s">And</a> that's certainly different than being an actual manager of a theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6101.32s">And</a> the city maybe should have taken a bigger investment on the management side of bringing in somebody that's paying and that's their whole entire job is getting behind the shows to come in and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6115.134s">But</a> I think we have to change with the times as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6118.277s">I</a> think the marquee is a wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6122.162s">Hesitant</a> to the fact to have some advertising going on it other than the shows that are there Because I think that would essentially be another billboard type thing on Forest Street, and I wouldn't be totally for that to be honest with you But as long as we keep the integrity of the building as long as the Historical Commission signs off on it the Chevalier Commission of course who is in the custody in control of the building and <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6144.748s">as</a> well as I believe it would be the city council for a signed denial permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6148.87s">As</a> long as it goes through the proper channels and gets vetted properly, I'm for this 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6154.033s">But</a> I just think that this council, particularly the council that's here today and not ones of six, seven, eight years ago, have been very supportive of the arts, including the $15,000 that was, I believe, unanimously supported by myself and the other six members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6172.892s">over</a> the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6174.433s">So,</a> I'd just like to say I support your endeavor and move approval.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6376.88s">Hey,</a> for the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6379.121s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6380.382s">Do</a> you say you were going to put your own money and funding behind the show and they turned you down?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6386.306s">Well,</a> no, no, because normally a promoter comes in.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6391.29s">All</a> right, well, I'm just a little confused, because if you brought it to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6394.507s">As</a> a conduit, what is your role in it?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6402.993s">OK,</a> with that being said, you have your own private capital to put on a show.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6466.308s">Just</a> to follow up with the gentleman again, first of all, his facts are wrong, as occasionally they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6471.792s">The</a> city did not put up $15,000 for John Danva. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6474.994s">That</a> was a private entity that went to the Chevalier, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6482.949s">A</a> promoter?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6497.843s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6498.203s">And</a> the gentleman said the city put up the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6499.865s">I</a> know that wasn't the case because otherwise you would have to come through here through the general fund and the budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6506.491s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6530.537s">And</a> I remember, too, it's very easy to get up here and say, I'll bring this guy in and that guy in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6535.419s">But</a> if you don't have the funding to back it up, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6537.207s">I'll</a> give you a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6538.23s">A</a> few years ago, Representative Donato put his own capital behind it, had an outstanding show, Michael Amante, right down here in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6546.319s">The</a> place was packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6547.28s">The</a> local limousine companies were busy, the livery services, the restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6551.843s">But</a> Representative Donato took a leadership role and put up his own private capital in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6558.807s">So</a> Medford Kiwanis did it with Lou Rawls. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6562.11s">Lou</a> Rawls. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6563.05s">Lou</a> Rawls. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6564.171s">So</a> to say that they're just going to come, I mean, that's a fragment of people's imaginations.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6589.387s">I</a> think we have to be clear, because it was a statement that was made that the city of Medford put up the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6594.83s">And</a> as much as we'd like to, that's not the case at this <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6599.518s">at</a> this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6612.325s">It's</a> a big difference being a groupie with the people that play at nightclubs and tavern-type things, and actually being a promoter that brings in shows, writes a check to the Chevalier Commission for $25,000, $30,000, and then works off commission and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6627.815s">It's</a> a huge difference, and I've witnessed it firsthand through the likes of the Kiwanis and Representative Donato, so.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6636.66s">Yeah,</a> no, I just thought that was important, because I didn't want the taxpayers to think that we were just fronting money for shows at the Chevalier Auditorium.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6680.747s">Like</a> I said, the gentleman, I deal with facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6684.048s">I'm</a> certainly not going to go low and talk about the judge's order that was written and basically talked about the caliber of the individual that was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6692.61s">That's</a> for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6693.71s">But</a> facts and figures are important when you're at the people's forum.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6738.03s">If</a> we're going to have a gentleman that walks around here just screaming and yelling, I mean, you may want to do something as the presiding officer, because it's certainly disruptive to the entire group of people that are out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6748.713s">If</a> he has to be escorted off the grounds, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6751.574s">But</a> I'm actually a little bit nervous with the behavior that's being shown by that gentleman right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7600.489s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7602.691s">I</a> respectfully disagree with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7606.234s">I</a> have had the honor and the distinct pleasure to serve with the lady in question on this city council and have been through several budgets with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7614.941s">She</a> has the utmost integrity of high caliber. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7619.904s">And</a> I am sure that she's doing what is right according to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7624.987s">And</a> if she feels that resigning on May 15th is the way to go, then I support it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7631.652s">I</a> just, like I said, I just, the utmost integrity this woman has. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7636.115s">So</a> I just respectfully disagree with my council colleague, and I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7641.818s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7672.81s">Well,</a> as just a little quick follow-up, and I'm going to let it go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7677.593s">I'm</a> sure, and I haven't had any conversations with her since she announced to be a candidate for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7685.479s">And</a> I am sure, knowing her and the input and just the way she goes about her every day doing her job, she is doing it within the confines of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7696.426s">And</a> I have no question about anything as it relates to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7702.114s">I'm</a> not ready to take any type of vote on this other than to just say, I'm just letting my feelings be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7709.799s">Madam</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8210.41s">Thank</a> you, and I certainly agree with my colleague, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8215.554s">The</a> gentleman's just going about doing things on his own. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8219.597s">We</a> have a piece of property that abuts that, directly behind it, that is, we're going to be doing a multi-million dollar clean-up down there at some point, and there's been excavating equipment out there, moving the dirt around, and the dirt is touching buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8237.682s">systems,</a> at least they're monitoring for the chemicals that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8241.403s">I</a> mean, this isn't environmentally... If they're taking dirt out, where's the dirt going? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8245.464s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8248.164s">So</a> I think we have to send this to the Board of Health as well, Councilor Penta, to find out what's going on with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8254.245s">And</a> the other thing is, too, you know, you have people in this community, city employees, that do their due diligence and take their jobs very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8265.087s">After</a> city employees have done their jobs and inquire, what's the equipment for, and this and that, and asking where your permits are and all that, one of the gentlemen that's in this particular establishment is going in and basically threatening other businesses, saying they called the city on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8282.124s">I</a> mean, this guy's a vigilante running roughshod down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8287.516s">And</a> it's just totally unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8289.378s">And</a> the business owners are basically looking at him like a deer in the headlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8293.641s">Like,</a> what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8295.362s">It's</a> in the West Medford Municipal lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8298.104s">It's</a> the West Medford Municipal lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8302.888s">You're</a> underneath the, you have 300, 400 cars pulling in and out of there during the days, I assume, between all the different venues down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8312.156s">So</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8314.859s">I</a> think the city has to actually get a handle on what's going on down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8318.081s">Interesting</a> enough, I know the gentleman has the proper seating for the beer and wine license, and I quite honestly don't know what the definition of a cordial is. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8329.788s">I</a> know bigger restaurants in the community that have gone out and put the proper seating in to have full liquor licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8337.076s">and</a> made an investment in the pay and higher insurance bills and everything else due to those licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8342.624s">I</a> mean, are they at a disadvantage if they're serving stuff that doesn't conform with the particular license? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8347.711s">I</a> really don't know, to tell you the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8349.814s">So</a> this is all things that our department heads have to get back to us on, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8354.293s">and</a> then move forward in the appropriate manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8356.515s">Because</a> the biggest thing that disturbed me the most, though, like I said, with everything aside, going in and basically yelling at other business owners when there's a full store full of customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8367.524s">You</a> called the city on me and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8369.005s">Well,</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8369.545s">If</a> you do things right, you don't have to worry about anyone calling the city or a building inspector coming on your property and making sure you're doing things right. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8376.251s">Just</a> do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8377.192s">I</a> mean, Councilor Penta just read an advertisement talking about the seating and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8383.223s">It</a> hasn't even been before this council yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8385.065s">I</a> have a serious public safety issue I'm going to be looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8388.648s">What</a> if a car pulling out of a parking spot? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8392.562s">puts</a> the car in drive and goes right through this patio with 30 people eating on it down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8397.186s">I</a> mean, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8397.926s">Is</a> there going to be bollards? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8398.747s">Is</a> there going to be some barrier in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8401.529s">Is</a> it the border health an issue where the diesel trains are going by and out there eating? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8406.113s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8406.914s">But</a> this is where our department heads have to give us the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8410.516s">And</a> as long as the gentleman's doing everything right, good luck to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8414.239s">But</a> as far as I can see right now, from what I hear, and I know early on, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8420.538s">There</a> was some questions with the way the liquor license was written up. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8422.98s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8423.42s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8424.681s">Um,</a> and the way he was approaching his business, but serious, uh, disadvantage to businesses that are conforming to the rules and standards like counsel Penta stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8433.929s">So,</a> uh, I support having this sent to our department heads.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9926.151s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9927.572s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9930.333s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9931.394s">And</a> I've been a member of the school committee in the past and a member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9937.498s">And</a> I certainly respect the clear delineation <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9941.27s">of</a> the roles of each particular body. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9944.431s">The</a> school committee puts together a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9946.611s">They</a> come to the city council with that bottom line number, and we either say yay or nay on the overall funding package. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9955.974s">A</a> lot of good stuff has been going on in the schools, but there's also some questions, like Councilor Prentice said about the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9962.095s">That's</a> the first I'm hearing of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9963.776s">I</a> know that they're going to be bringing some new programs into the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9969.448s">in</a> the very near future, and I'm not so sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9973.35s">I</a> just haven't heard what you're saying, and I'm sure there is probably some truth to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9978.152s">Somewhere</a> in the middle, there's something going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9980.633s">But</a> I really believe that this is a school committee issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9984.855s">We</a> have school committee members that do a great job getting into that budget during the budget process, so I will not be supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9993.86s">Just</a> for the mere reason that this is a school committee issue, as far as I'm concerned, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9998.504s">And</a> I respect the budget that they put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10002.385s">And</a> in most of these positions, too, are subject to some sort of collective bargaining agreement, I would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10011.909s">There's</a> very few employees that are at will employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10015.45s">I</a> know there's some confidential secretaries, but most of the people are in the administrator's union or the teacher's association. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10023.777s">So</a> that's the majority of the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10025.738s">And</a> then the rest is the nurses and the paraprofessionals, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10029.741s">But</a> most of them are under a collective bargaining agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10032.923s">So</a> for those reasons, I wish the school committee well as they prepare their next budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10727.725s">Yes,</a> just real quick on the Narcan and just want to thank Councilor Lungo and Councilor Penta for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10733.748s">As</a> well as just send another thank you to Janelle Rocco, who was working hard to put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10740.53s">And</a> also Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10742.771s">Councilor</a> Penta was one of the main speakers today at the event out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10747.042s">Many</a> people didn't know what was going on when they seen Councilor Penta in front of City Hall with a bullhorn today. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10752.786s">Many</a> people were questioning whether it was your announcement for Mayor or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10756.768s">So,</a> with that being said, I want to congratulate the Councilor for partaking in it today.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11224.993s">Nope,</a> I'm all set.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11307.014s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11308.535s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11308.995s">And</a> just to refresh everyone's memory, probably within the last month and a half, I had brought forward a proposal and it was, I believe, unanimously supported by the council, but I'm not 100% sure on that, for the mayor to go out and solicit input by using a poll or something like that for data so that we can make decisions based upon data and statistical <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11330.587s">driven</a> decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11332.888s">So</a> maybe if we can incorporate that into something like this, maybe, because basically you're reaching out to people in the community, but you want to get a good idea of what's important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11344.614s">And</a> I believe Cambridge just did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11346.575s">And</a> the biggest thing, like you said, was they let the younger kids participate, whether it was a skate park or this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11352.558s">And</a> this was within the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11354.579s">I</a> remember reading it in the Globe South, I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11357.541s">So</a> it's a pretty interesting concept.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12493.217s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12494.038s">We're</a> in receipt of a paper this evening from the city solicitor who basically says that the mayor is the only, it happens to be on the parking question we asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12503.022s">But</a> it basically says that all contracts involved in the amount of $5,000 or more shall be in writing and no such contract shall be deemed to have been made or executed until the approval of the mayor under plan A. So clearly this is a function of the mayor and him being the issuing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12521.252s">With</a> that being said, I think we have to find out where the city is going as far as the public access component. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12527.632s">Because</a> if it's going up at the high school, I think people have to, I would be very cognizant of the fact that we have to have people quarry cleared. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12534.956s">So</a> that to make sure if they're in the same areas and buildings as youngsters in our community, that we want to make sure that the proper <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12544.335s">People</a> are vetted for that, for less of a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12548.538s">I</a> really don't know much about this bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12550.659s">This</a> is something that was put on under suspension this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12554.322s">I</a> don't even recognize any of the names of the people that signed on to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12558.605s">If</a> I saw a name like Donato or Garbally or some of the other reps or senators that I'm familiar with and are familiar with some of their policies, I would be a little bit easier to at least support it this evening in its infancy stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12574.153s">But</a> for those reasons, I don't think we should be taking a vote on this at this particular point, not knowing where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12581.898s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12775.162s">That</a> I put forward to find out about where we're going with access and the Corey piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12780.944s">Want</a> to make sure that everyone's Corey clear.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g/2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g.html">Medford City Council - April 21, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=584.403s">Councilor</a> Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=588.244s">I'd</a> like to move suspension of two papers, 15-307 and then another one in the hands of the clerk that Councilor Penta submitted regarding the parking kiosks.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=604.668s">Yeah,</a> the revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=607.389s">Unfinished</a> business.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1016.906s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1018.047s">And</a> it was a few weeks ago when Councilor Penta brought the paper forward to get rid of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1024.13s">And</a> at that point, I had stated that I'm getting very close to supporting his resolution, but I wanted to see it take <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1031.758s">take</a> a few more weeks and just to see if they could get things straightened out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1035.68s">Obviously,</a> at this point, the mayor and his top officials have not held this company accountable, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1044.103s">So,</a> in light of that, I have a resolution I'd like to submit on behalf of Councilor Pinter and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1049.91s">basically</a> that says that in light of the recent actions of Republic Parkins job performance and the failure of the city administration to hold them accountable Be it resolved that the mayor and his top administration officials remove the pay-to-park kiosks throughout this community It's to the point now where it's loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1069.054s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1070.615s">This</a> is a complete failure of <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1072.66s">This</a> is a complete failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1073.701s">And</a> I understand the mayor's very busy, but he had his top people put this thing together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1079.065s">This</a> wasn't the new schools they built. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1081.927s">This</a> wasn't the DPW yard that looks so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1085.53s">For</a> whatever reason, this has been a complete and utter failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1089.112s">And</a> I just think it's time that we move forward with doing in-house parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1095.477s">And</a> I asked a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1096.378s">I'm</a> going to actually have it up a little later. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1098.019s">A</a> few weeks ago, I actually asked, and the council supported this unanimously, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1102.093s">for</a> a copy of all the transfers that have taken place from July 1st to now, because I wanted to see what money out there they're transferring around within the budget, because obviously that's overtaxing the people, and everyone talks about how fiscally stable this community is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1117.621s">It's</a> only because they overbudgeted, and at the end of the year, it gets certified and put into the free cash accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1122.863s">It's</a> obviously what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1124.004s">You</a> don't get $6 million in a rainy day certified free cash account if you're not overtaxing the people during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1131.192s">And</a> they're not too quick to give us that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1133.494s">So</a> once again, I'd ask Budget Director Burke to send us this information forthwith. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1139.098s">And</a> at that point, look and see if we have additional funding so that we can either purchase some of the equipment to do it in-house, whatever has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1148.725s">But</a> the public outcry from the citizens of this community, it's, I'm done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1153.329s">Yesterday,</a> Mr. President, yesterday, people parked their cars on streets in the whole West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1160.697s">The</a> whole West Medford area, they parked their cars so they could go down and watch Paul Revere ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1164.64s">And</a> they came back to tickets on their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1166.521s">And</a> the signs clearly said, parking certain hours, excluding holidays, Saturday and Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1176.849s">If</a> Patriot's Day is not a considered holiday, the mayor doesn't have this building open to come down here and pay your water bill, or to come down here and get some information that you may need from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1190.194s">you're</a> going to get a parking ticket the same day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1191.795s">The</a> trash is put off by a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1194.297s">And</a> I just don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1197.719s">I</a> brought this to the attention of the budget director yesterday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1200.802s">She</a> was gracious enough to take my call on a day off, and I explained to her the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1206.606s">But</a> to have the city administration and <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1212.132s">The</a> parking company, not on the same page as far as what consists of holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1215.936s">Are</a> we going to go through this every Bunker Hill day, every evacuation day, everything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1220.381s">It</a> just, it doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1222.103s">And</a> once again, I'm asking, I'm asking to support Councilors Penta's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1227.89s">from</a> a few weeks ago and get rid of this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1232.033s">And</a> like I said, if I can just read it again, and this is offered by Councilor Penter and myself.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1274.862s">No,</a> I get another paper, I'm gonna discuss that later.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1283.975s">Yes,</a> it's going to be an amendment, excuse me, an amendment from myself and Councilor Penta that in light of the actions of Republic Parkings, recent job performance and the failure of the city administration to hold them accountable, be it resolved that the mayor and his administration remove the pay to park kiosks for it with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1302.526s">And,</a> uh, I would request a roll call vote on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1311.891s">And,</a> uh, as I said, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1314.212s">I've</a> been very, very patient, trying not to get to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1317.473s">But</a> after yesterday, and just when you call the office too and ask them, they really didn't have any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1323.435s">I</a> know Councilor Penta mentioned earlier, he called the office and they were rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1327.577s">They</a> weren't rude, they were very nice to me, but they just, well, I have to call another guy here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1331.858s">Somerville,</a> Somerville, as Councilor Marks often says, they jump out of the trees to give you tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1336.96s">Somerville</a> wasn't giving out tickets yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1339.481s">And</a> they bring in $8 million a year with their program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1342.852s">So</a> something's wrong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1345.013s">And</a> at this point, let's get these kiosks out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1348.033s">Let's</a> get the city back to some sort of sense of normalcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1351.234s">And</a> last but not least, as far as I'm concerned, I still think there should be strict parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1358.316s">But</a> do it in a manner that's not so disrupting to the community and with a company or a department here within City Hall that can actually get the job done.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1404.7s">Council</a> President, if I can finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1406.8s">Sorry,</a> Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1410.381s">If</a> I could just finish.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1412.602s">Councilor</a> Penter alluded to the fact that we're having a meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1416.383s">I</a> know I spoke with you earlier today, but I think this meeting should be postponed till when the carnival's out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1421.725s">There's</a> no way to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1423.225s">Based</a> upon the last few meetings on this particular matter, based upon the public outcry with this particular issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1429.248s">To</a> have it on a Wednesday night where City Hall is open and we have this carnival out back here, I just think it's, I think it's doing an injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1436.829s">We</a> got, we got seven of us here tonight, elected members of the City Council, and I think only two or three of us got parking spots on City Hall property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1444.451s">It's,</a> I just don't think we should move forward with it tomorrow night, but that's my humble opinion and whatever the Council sees fit.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2108.977s">contract</a> where they haven't you know, there's just so many unanswered questions and Just just another thought Thank you, and I thank councillor lungo current for her thoughts and like I said this this resolution didn't come easy but it's at a juncture where They just keep every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2134.239s">It's</a> something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2134.82s">It's</a> something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2135.42s">It's</a> something new <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2137.498s">Street</a> sweeping has not started yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2139.319s">We</a> tick it in and toe, well, it has started, but like in full force, tick it in and towing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2143.64s">And</a> just enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2147.022s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2147.682s">We're</a> having a meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2148.782s">You're</a> going to have to park at Representative Donato's office down on Salem Street to walk here because there's going to be no parking in the immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2158.406s">Obviously,</a> and that's why I still say that we should cancel this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2161.487s">I'm</a> only one of seven, but to give people the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2165.226s">Councilor</a> Caraviello this evening is parked up behind Tony Lucci's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2169.327s">I'm</a> parked down in an adjacent parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2173.188s">Other</a> members of the council are parked far beyond the area of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2177.569s">I</a> just think it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2179.749s">And</a> we don't have City Hall open this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2181.71s">City</a> Hall is closed for all intents and purposes tonight except the Medford City Council members, a few people from the administration that were here earlier, as well as the few guests that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2192.15s">But</a> to do it tomorrow night, and I respectfully, I understand what Councilor Marks says, but we're not going to get the administration back at the table in two weeks or four weeks to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2202.172s">So</a> I just, that's my thoughts and I would like to see it canceled and move forward to a date that, and you know what, if no one shows up at that point, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2214.154s">But</a> it's incumbent upon us to get the community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2217.574s">We're</a> the people's forum and that's why <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2221.302s">If</a> yesterday didn't happen, I would have been bringing this up tomorrow evening with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2225.965s">But</a> after yesterday, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2229.448s">I'm</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2230.989s">I</a> mean, I'm not going to be changing my mind on their performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2233.591s">The</a> mayor and his senior staff, they're holding this company accountable.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2558.112s">Just</a> one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2560.213s">If</a> we also could get an update, I believe when the budget was put together by the budget director and the city administration, anticipated receipts from this anticipated program is in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2573.3s">So</a> that may be why they don't want to pull out of this as quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2577.122s">So</a> if we could ask that question, because they factored this year's budget, I'm assuming based upon the income from this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2585.743s">We've</a> asked for the data, and we still don't get it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2601.372s">FY</a> 2016 budget.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3643.767s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3648.122s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3648.762s">If</a> I may, as well, too, we have to send a loud, clear message to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3654.747s">He's</a> done so many great things for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3657.188s">This</a> thing has not been done the way it could have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3661.512s">But</a> at this point, we have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3663.813s">So</a> I agree with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3666.255s">At</a> this point, we have to make the statement that we think that this was a complete and utter failure, done under different circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3673.44s">Maybe</a> it would have worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3674.361s">But</a> obviously, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3677.167s">I</a> hear about this particular issue everywhere I go every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3682.429s">So</a> I think that this vote, it's not long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3688.251s">For</a> me, it's about 24 hours overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3690.472s">Because</a> as of yesterday, when the frosting on the cake was people going on a holiday and parking and getting citations, and it's time to just move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3704.565s">And</a> I think, as I stated in the resolution, as a result of the breach of contract, remove the kiosks and have enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3712.048s">And</a> I, as one member of this council, and I believe all the councillors chimed in at the Committee of the Whole meeting when we were there, there were several meetings with the budget director, Stephanie Burke, as well as the mayor, who instituted the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3725.293s">Loud</a> and clear, we said we preferred meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3729.034s">Single</a> head or double head meters, where people would just throw a quarter in, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3732.318s">No</a> one could say they didn't know how to work them, didn't know how to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3736.721s">People,</a> you look at some of the old pitches in Medford Square, they had the meters way back in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3741.804s">So</a> with that being said, obviously, they didn't take our recommendations then. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3746.207s">We</a> have to just go upon the past precedents and the past practices of what happened around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3752.151s">We</a> send recommendations, very few of them get acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3755.953s">There's</a> gonna be no different with this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3758.335s">Let's</a> take a vote as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3760.88s">And</a> if you feel that you're at the point where this is out of control and it should be terminated, vote yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3767.025s">And</a> otherwise, vote no. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3768.806s">But</a> to say that we're going to meet tomorrow night and we're going to get this all straightened out, it's not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3773.81s">We're</a> four months into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3775.311s">We've</a> got a carnival going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3776.552s">We're</a> not going to hear half of the stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3778.174s">People</a> are going to drive here not knowing there's a carnival. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3780.456s">They're</a> going to keep going because they can't get a parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3783.378s">We</a> had a lot of senior citizens that came to the last meetings from different parts of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3787.461s">They're</a> not going to be able to find a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3790.256s">So</a> I really believe I'm just one member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3793.938s">I'd</a> also like to make another amendment to take a vote on holding the meeting tomorrow as a result with a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3799.242s">Because</a> if we get the mayor and the administrative team in here tomorrow, they're not coming back at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3804.245s">They're</a> not coming back at a later date if they decide that they are not going to agree with the council if we do vote to terminate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3810.85s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Penta because, as we said, we are in unison with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3815.733s">It</a> took me a while to get here, but the fact of the matter is <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3820.335s">It's</a> not going to be straightened out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3821.536s">It's</a> not going to be straightened out.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4436.614s">The</a> original paper that was brought forward, 15-307, by Councilor Penta that was on the table, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4442.202s">If</a> we withdraw that whole paper and approve the new one with the language that you just added to, in breach of contract, because I like that language, add Councilor Lungo Kearns to that, I think we all get what we're looking to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4456.739s">Which</a> is, and here's the other piece too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4460.899s">Oh,</a> leave the kiosk only? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4462.78s">It's</a> clear in the resolution I submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4464.861s">Remove,</a> and Councilor Penta, remove the kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4468.183s">We</a> could have in-house enforcement tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4469.744s">People</a> do not like the kiosk approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4472.066s">They</a> hate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4472.806s">They</a> absolutely hate being able to go to the kiosk and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4475.668s">They</a> don't know how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4478.469s">I'm</a> pretty computer savvy and it was a hard time the other day when you use your credit card and you're trying to add time to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4485.072s">How</a> much time do you want to do max, this, that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4487.534s">It's</a> overwhelming to people, these kiosks, the user side of things.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4494.68s">That's</a> my recommendation.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5614.571s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5615.031s">And</a> I just have a little problem with this where, and this is no disrespect to you, Matt, where Matt is uploading these and it's not an official city employee that's actually doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5627.141s">And</a> the reason I say that, I've been very consistent with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5631.864s">When</a> other people wanted to put stuff on the webpage or on something, I think it has to be, should be done by a city official in some sort of a capacity that could be held accountable if indeed they went a little haywire and put something on there or the wrong link was, you know what I'm trying to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5651.595s">Certainly</a> I don't think you'd ever do anything malicious. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5654.397s">But</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5657.213s">I</a> just think it's more of a city function. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5659.554s">It</a> seems like you got this all into a compact area where at least it's all the data and the videos are collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5669.796s">But</a> this is something that really the city IT department, not Mike Ferretti, but the website management, Alison Goldsberry and whoever else runs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5678.339s">I</a> know at one time the city webpage was done by Councilor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5682.26s">She</a> did a great job with it, getting it to this new platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5685.161s">But</a> at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5687.422s">At</a> this point, I think what we need to see is this done by a city employee that, like I said, in no disrespect to yourself, and this is something the council called for of a Ponya recommendation, actually, but I definitely think this should be done by a city official and not an outside entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5704.908s">If</a> the city wanted to enter into a contract with the gentleman to do it, maybe for a small stipend or something, but where he's held accountable and it has to be done on time and everything else, I could see something like that, but that certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5717.465s">up</a> to the mayor's office, but I just, the next precedent would be what if someone else wants to upload something and they're not as credible as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5726.827s">You</a> follow me?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5733.189s">Well,</a> they're the ones that are going to have to respond to put the links on the webpage, so.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7566.443s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7566.684s">If</a> we could also, um, once again, I brought it up, uh, about a month or so ago to send it to the mayor and the director of budget and personnel, the DPW commission position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7577.052s">Um,</a> the personnel director posted the job on the webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7580.074s">Then</a> it came down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7580.975s">Now</a> I'm hearing they're not filling the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7583.897s">So</a> this is another example of us funding a position within a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7590.787s">for</a> over $100,000 a year, and them not doing what the intent was. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7595.95s">And</a> this is why I asked for the transfer list.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2748.955s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2749.996s">And</a> I said what I had to say regarding the noise a few weeks ago, that I was sure the Lawrence Memorial Hospital would do whatever they could under his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2758.122s">But</a> this evening, I would like to publicly thank, number one, and congratulate Mr. McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2765.348s">You</a> know, there's no one better, no one better, in my eyes, to run our local hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2771.713s">Someone</a> that's volunteered there, has been a member of the board for 20-plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2777.455s">And</a> he's committed to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2780.397s">And</a> when we're on the bigger horizon of possibly merging with an international institute that's known for medicine throughout the world, I don't think there's anyone better that could be in charge than Mr. McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2796.708s">So</a> as a city, we're very lucky that we have this young gentleman here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2801.571s">So</a> I want to wish you well in your new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2804.633s">And</a> very, very, very responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2807.967s">I've</a> had a column three times in the last few months and gets back to the same day and meets the needs of this community every time that something within reasonableness is requested of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2819.269s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3572.559s">I</a> was just going to speak after this paper, if we could take a few other items on the suspension.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4083.37s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4084.77s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4085.851s">If</a> I may, in the past, my take on this whole merger has been I'm looking at a trend in the medical field in greater Boston, which is unique in its has the best teaching hospitals around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4099.937s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4101.422s">There</a> is a major trend from the 1990s to today that hospitals... When's the last time we saw a new hospital opening? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4109.287s">1937,</a> when Daniel Lawrence opened this up, or whatever the year was? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4112.609s">Hospitals</a> are tending to close now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4114.951s">New</a> England Memorial, right here in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4117.112s">It</a> was sitting as a vacant building up until recently, a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4120.414s">The</a> Malden Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4121.675s">The</a> Whitten Hospital was on its last breath, and Cambridge Health Alliance came in and bought it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4128.039s">In</a> the Boston Globe yesterday, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4130.592s">The</a> Spaulding Hospital for Continuing Medical Care North Shore, 275 employees, 160 beds closing this September. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4139.578s">This</a> September. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4141.38s">Now</a> that's going to become a vacant building up in Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4144.121s">The</a> last thing I want to see as a city councilor is a vacant building in the Lawrence Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4150.052s">That's</a> the last thing I want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4151.873s">I</a> am convinced, based upon statistical data that we've been watching in this greater Boston area, on the South Shore, on the North Shore, and throughout the nation, that without mergers of this nature, we're not going to have a hospital in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4166.664s">Mrs.</a> Casey, we don't know what she may look out the window and see up in her neighborhood, quite honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4173.649s">And</a> that within itself is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4175.29s">It</a> could change the whole character of an entire neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4178.729s">So</a> as far as I'm concerned, I think that this is, I still think that this is definitely a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4185.833s">People</a> are concerned as far as employees up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4188.074s">It's</a> a major employer of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4191.336s">But</a> I'd rather see people that are employed up there have an opportunity to go work for some entity on Lawrence Road that's a healthcare facility than get a pink slip, close its doors, and now they're collecting unemployment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4205.123s">I</a> think it's the way lesser of two evils. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4207.788s">So</a> for all those reasons, plus I think we're in good hands with the leadership at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital right now, I think it's the premier time to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4218.914s">Because</a> with all due respect to people out there that may be against this, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4225.112s">This</a> might be the only thing that keeps that building alive, vibrant, and accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4230.136s">And</a> let's not forget about another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4232.458s">Urgent</a> cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4233.979s">1984,</a> you didn't even hear of urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4236.381s">1995,</a> you didn't even hear of urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4238.102s">Urgent</a> care is servicing just as many patients a day, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4242.225s">Am</a> I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4243.326s">Then</a> the emergency rooms in this entire area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4246.448s">People</a> don't want to have to wait three hours to get a quick two stitches on their finger because they cut a piece of meatloaf or something at their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4253.434s">They</a> want to go into urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4254.935s">They're</a> in and out within 45 minutes an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4256.757s">That's</a> what most of them pride themselves on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4258.858s">We</a> have one right up here at the Lawrence Memorial site that's open up until I believe seven o'clock at night.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4264.463s">Winchester</a> Hospital is opening them up everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4266.544s">You</a> can go to Wilmington and get into Winchester Urgent Care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4268.766s">You</a> can go <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4270.658s">You</a> can go, I believe it's Redding, there's another urgent care.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4275.76s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4276.32s">So</a> the trends are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4278.44s">And</a> for us to sit here and not obviously look at the statistical data, I'm not saying that we're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4282.642s">But</a> I think this is very unique because I think based upon the conversations that have been behind this rail over the past few years regarding this merger, as you said, since 2012, I think we're all cognizant of that fact for the Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4296.746s">Because</a> I've already heard from people over on Sampson Road and on the backside of the hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4300.797s">where</a> the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the nursing home agreed to grow bushes recently and bring in bushes to protect some of the integrity of the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4308.664s">I</a> know the original agreement.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4335.049s">I'm</a> not sure why you would insinuate that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4340.37s">It</a> was a mutual agreement originally in the original plans with the city of Medford back when that nursing home was built, when you were on the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4347.092s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4350.553s">Council,</a> we're on the same page here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4352.033s">We're</a> on the same page here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4353.894s">So</a> like I said, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4355.634s">I</a> think we have to continue to endorse this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4357.755s">I</a> think the city council should go on record <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4359.956s">sending</a> another letter to the new attorney general that the city council supports this merger with partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4366.879s">And,</a> uh, at some point, if the attorney general will not allow that to go through, I would personally recommend the board and, um, in the powers to be to start pursuing other relationships with other hospitals that may be smaller, that the attorney general will allow to pass, because that's the only future I think we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4386.325s">having</a> a medical facility in the Lawrence Road area, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4390.506s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4411.871s">Well,</a> if you notice in the, if you notice in the, in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4416.255s">The</a> paperwork that was filed by the judge, they didn't even talk about the North Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4422.197s">It</a> was all about the South Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4425.098s">And</a> I would say, given the relationship of the North Shore area with the folks in Boston, I would say they'd be more palatable to seeing this side of the merger go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4445.978s">As</a> a community, I think we owe it to the workers, and as you stated, the nurses and everyone else up there, to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4451.32s">If</a> we really believe, like I do, and I'm not saying we all do, but if we really believe the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to be closed within a few years if a merger doesn't take place, then I think it's our job and duty to ask them to continue the negotiations and the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4465.645s">And</a> that's it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4533.466s">Thank</a> you, Mr. I would like to make a motion to send that same exact letter that we sent out to the authorities at the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4541.553s">I</a> believe it was to the attorney general as well as the other agencies that were involved in the merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4546.118s">The</a> same letter to the new attorney general where the leadership has changed in the AG's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4551.223s">And</a> I'd like to have a roll call vote on that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4564.67s">It</a> was supporting the merger in its, um, not in the specifics of it, but in the principles, the principles that were being spoke about.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5215.796s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5217.057s">I</a> am very happy that the mayor has brought forth the two names he has this evening, Mrs. Beatrice, as well as Mr. Jim Tarani, who have been serving in this capacity and doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5226.703s">And</a> I move approval on the paper before us.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5466.468s">Please</a> record me in opposition of the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5468.088s">And</a> I was ready to move on this this evening, but, uh, that's council motion to table as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6147.035s">First</a> of all, I would like to go on record in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6150.218s">These</a> Medford residents that are employed through this, Medford taxpayers, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6156.15s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6157.27s">Number</a> two, and I don't mean to say this inflammatory, but the gentleman that just spoke brings up issues about the federal government after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6165.532s">Common</a> Core we talked about, which we have no jurisdiction over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6168.272s">We</a> talked about probably 27 times here at the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6171.933s">We've</a> talked about oil coming from other countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6174.733s">We've</a> talked about many issues that we have no jurisdiction over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6178.754s">This</a> is well within the right of any city councilor to bring forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6182.955s">Just</a> earlier, within the last hour, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6186.325s">We</a> talked about the nurses that may be losing their jobs at Lawrence Memorial Hospital, and doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6192.468s">So</a> to say that this is going on uncharted territory, as our fine city solicitor would say, that's fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6200.631s">So</a> I do support you, Councilor Knight, and I support the working people that go to Tufts University every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6206.001s">and</a> they do a fine job, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6208.903s">Too</a> many things around here are getting taken over by machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6211.725s">You</a> drive on the toll booths now, you drive through with your little fast pass, how many people lose their jobs? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6216.669s">You</a> go to the touch bank now, you go to the ATM instead of using people that actually work the counter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6223.414s">Technology</a> is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6226.67s">But</a> at the end of the day, you need people to do the jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6230.213s">So</a> as far as I'm concerned, I support these working men and women that are here this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6236.438s">I</a> do not know the language of their contract, but in principle, as we talked about earlier, in principle, I support them wholeheartedly, and I support Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6246.105s">But</a> to talk that we're going down uncharted territories, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6250.208s">I</a> mean, I'd like to just take an hour to go back and look at the records of just this calendar year and see how many things we've talked about that have no jurisdiction of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6262.393s">So</a> I do support the council that brought this forward this evening.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6393.362s">Mr.</a> President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6395.402s">Thank</a> you for your point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6396.763s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6399.363s">Just</a> a point, and then just real quick, but the city of Somerville is <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6405.649s">having</a> the same type of resolution slash, not hearing, but the individuals as well as representatives from the city of Somerville, a meeting on April 9th on this very same matter.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7780.267s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7781.287s">And</a> I do want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn, because a lot of this does start in the schools, and education is an important piece of this puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7791.512s">Also,</a> if, Mr. President, if we could ask the mayor for the update on where the ordinance is, because just in the past few weeks, individuals that attended our meetings, attended our meetings here because their loved ones were affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7805.838s">We've</a> had individuals that attended our meeting, and their loved ones have passed since our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7810.915s">So</a> this is a serious thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7812.636s">It's</a> so fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7816.359s">Every</a> day you're picking up the newspaper, you're reading another name. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7821.043s">So</a> let's get this moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7824.906s">I</a> know the mayor is working on it, and it's floating around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7827.068s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7828.248s">I</a> think this is such an important issue, the mayor should put something out to all the department heads, give them a deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7834.673s">Here's</a> an ordinance that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7835.714s">You</a> have until the end of business on this day to sign off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7838.663s">and</a> at least get it back to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7839.983s">I</a> know they're working on it, but as I just demonstrated via the example that I gave, this is something that's affecting people on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7849.925s">In</a> the past two weeks or three weeks since our meeting, there's been several people that have died as a result of this disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7857.527s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7859.287s">And</a> on a positive note, thank you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, for bringing this forward, because it does all start in the very small ages in our schools.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8436.805s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8437.165s">And</a> just an FYI, a gentleman that was at the podium just was speaking about right turn over in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8443.266s">And</a> that's a great resource for youngsters throughout the communities around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8447.547s">That's</a> closing its doors in the very near future, moving to a faraway community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8452.708s">So</a> that's another resource that people from Medford utilize and is moving on to a new facility outside of the immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8460.63s">So</a> just so as quick as we're adding resources, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8465.108s">To</a> combat the problem, resources for whatever reasons are getting depleted as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8473.892s">So</a> you take 10 steps forward, then it's five back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8478.133s">And</a> it's only getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8479.354s">So</a> thank you again, Councilor Lungo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8756.056s">week</a> or so to see if we can get additional crosswalk signs down in the immediate area near the Two Sisters, in the Seafood, it's still called the Seafood Depot, what's the name of it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8766.962s">The</a> Seafood Grill, I think, but, Seafood Grill, thanks, Councilor Penta, and then down the street as well near Sunnyhurst, just the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8776.907s">A</a> lot of people traverse it, and additional signage definitely will be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8782.472s">And</a> I know Councilor Marks put something on a few weeks ago, a B paper, regarding doing the crosswalks over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8789.295s">So</a> if we can make that a priority as well, because as we all know, we're all got the same emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8794.237s">Since</a> this appeared on the agenda, people from the pedestrian committee have reached out to the entire council about improving crosswalks throughout the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8806.617s">And</a> the one recommendation that was made to me, as well as all the members of the council, and me personally, I think it was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8812.721s">We</a> should be going with the new crosswalk signs, similar to the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8816.704s">They're</a> the fluorescent, real, real bright at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8822.588s">So</a> if we could send that to the DPW.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9196.716s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9197.437s">And</a> I was corrected by my council colleague and the young woman from West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9203.221s">I</a> said Sunnyhurst Farms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9204.582s">As</a> we all know, Sunnyhurst Farms is now Goulding School of Dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9208.125s">I</a> meant to say the West Medford Spa. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9214.472s">Of</a> course.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11054.717s">Exactly</a> what are you saying they should be ticketed and towed for?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11060.199s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11060.499s">I</a> just want to ask the councilor exactly what, I mean, if it's just a sign on the back, the police can't ticket or tow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11069.407s">I</a> mean, are they not inspected?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11075.869s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11092.812s">That's</a> my question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11094.433s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11269.231s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11270.051s">If</a> we could also get an update on the cable to find out when the new, it's not so new anymore, Verizon Fios contract is up for renewal as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11279.213s">Because</a> I thought that they were up around the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11282.893s">No,</a> no, I know they came in after the fact, but I thought that they staggered it so that they would be renewed around the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11288.314s">I</a> had thought that, but.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11660.436s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11663.597s">Thank</a> you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11664.637s">We</a> have a receipt tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11666.197s">of</a> a letter in response to resolution 15-061 from Barbara Rubel at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11674.341s">It's</a> talking about the runoff water regarding the snow that they were dumping from their campus into the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11682.504s">As</a> the neighbor stated, I think it's just as big of a concern as the, as I know residents were concerned where Medford was dumping the snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11691.908s">It's</a> got contaminants in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11693.369s">A</a> lot of times oil and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11696.125s">I</a> don't see anywhere in this letter that addresses if at all there was looked at for environmental issues, other than just saying there was sand underneath the field, a big layer of sand which helps the water drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11711.471s">I</a> have a bigger concern with not the water draining and creating maybe a little moisture down there, but any contaminants, the salt, oil that may be picked up and other stuff that's <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11722.945s">that's</a> on the street surfaces that were plowed and then the snow was dumped. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11726.847s">So</a> if we could just send this copy of this letter, Mr. Finn, up to our Board of Health, just to take a look at and see if in the future any other precautions should be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11736.472s">Because</a> I know in the past, I don't see any difference with this, as Councilor Penta brought up a few years ago, Meadow Glen Mall, remember when they were dumping all the snow from all their other properties, the snow farms? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11746.977s">And</a> we were concerned about the environmental hazards of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11750.159s">So</a> just to make sure that, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11753.174s">It</a> was monitored properly.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=202.611s">So</a> on the motion of Councilor Camuso for non-objection,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2215.207s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2217.612s">I</a> think that Wendy's has to make a determination, and if they want to proceed with this, I agree with Councilor Marks 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2225.777s">If</a> they want to proceed with this, I think we have to move reconsideration on the 3 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2230.681s">license,</a> or at least put six-month review on the 3 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2234.323s">license,</a> because we could eventually have a real albatross around our neck in the residential neighbourhood, as Councilor Marks stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2242.806s">They</a> have their 3 o'clock license and they get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2245.987s">And</a> we all know that Malden still has bar rooms that are open till 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2251.128s">And</a> traditionally, people get out of there and they'd always head to Wendy's, Kelly's and Burger King. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2256.87s">So</a> I definitely agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2258.47s">This</a> is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2261.171s">Could</a> you speak on behalf of Wendy's and what's more important to the operation right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2265.592s">Is</a> it the seating or is it the 3 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2268.052s">drive-thru</a> license? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2269.193s">Because</a> I can't see <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2270.504s">I</a> can't see doing both of them at this point, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2273.366s">Because</a> we all know that that may be fenced off or a chain or something, but you're still going to have people, I mean, we have other establishments that their furniture gets stolen at 2, 3 in the morning from in front of their restaurants in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2288.574s">So</a> I just don't feel comfortable, to be quite honest, doing both of these at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2293.797s">I</a> don't know how the rest of my council colleagues feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2298.066s">I</a> think if we're gonna do this, we should put a six-month review on the license that we just gave a few minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2306.208s">Would</a> you, can you speak on behalf of?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2313.289s">On</a> both?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2321.191s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2321.451s">Yeah,</a> they do, but they're on the Revere Beach Parkway side. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2323.731s">There's</a> a couple metal tables.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2356.453s">The</a> other thing I would... I agree with Councilor Marks if there's an aesthetically pleasing way where you can do higher wrought iron with a gate that they can actually lock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2366.161s">I</a> mean, if you drive up Route 28, up near Kitty's and stuff, you have some of the smaller restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2371.304s">McDonald's,</a> for instance, has a nice wrought iron fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2374.107s">It's</a> black, but it prevents people from jumping over it and getting in there when they're not supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2381.012s">But</a> the current setup, I just think... I think you're actually asking for problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2386.008s">Um,</a> and I agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2388.009s">It's</a> a very, uh, condensed residential neighbourhood right on the other side of BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2392.51s">And,</a> uh, as you know, you get your air conditioner on on a, uh, nice summer night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2396.851s">I</a> mean, uh, your window's open with the air conditioner off, you can hear things travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2401.112s">So,</a> um, I'd like to, if Councilor Marks is okay with it, I would, uh, I would like to see the six-month review, as the Councilor said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2409.374s">But</a> also, right after this vote's taken, I'm gonna move reconsideration on the initial vote to put a six-month review on that as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2648.287s">Well,</a> Mr. President?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2651.489s">That</a> leads up to something right along the lines, and I think it would be something that Councilor Marks, and I'm not speaking for him, but maybe that would be satisfying to him and myself, because obviously there's some neighborhood concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2666.02s">What</a> about one of those tops that you shut down the whole patio at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2669.493s">It</a> just, you roll it out from the wall, and it comes with the vinyl, so you actually can't walk in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2675.274s">It</a> goes around the four corners.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2685.777s">Yeah,</a> but the table being covered is still gonna not prevent people from going in the patio at three in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2690.598s">So</a> you said cover the tarp? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2693.338s">You</a> know what I'm talking about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2694.398s">Like,</a> pool yards and things like that would actually go, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2697.732s">It's</a> very aesthetically pleasing, and it comes out, and it just attaches to the four corners for lack of the scientific.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2724.584s">Make</a> a motion to have it <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2727.513s">Covered</a> up by virtue of connecting a vinyl something or something aesthetically pleasing to all four corners, so that at 11 o'clock at night, anything within the regular operating hours.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2800.867s">That's</a> what you stated.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2830.199s">11</a> o'clock, it closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2831.92s">Unless</a> someone else has better... I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2835.802s">We're</a> all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2836.783s">I</a> guess it's my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2837.363s">To</a> protect the integrity of the neighbourhood.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3110.205s">Quick</a> question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3114.695s">Does</a> anyone know what time Brewers Patio closes? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3118.098s">Because</a> that's directly across the street, and that's... In Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3122.1s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3122.861s">That's</a> a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3124.022s">2</a> o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3124.282s">It's</a> right on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3124.942s">It</a> is 2 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3125.523s">The</a> patio too? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3126.443s">I've</a> been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3129.065s">The</a> question is, we haven't had any complaints about that, but I think the 8 o'clock is definitely a good start.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3170.962s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3172.183s">Mr.</a> Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3173.384s">While</a> we're under suspension, I'd like to move reconsideration on 15-089.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3196.915s">I'd</a> like to put a six-month review on this, at least present it to the council with a six-month review.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3267.822s">It'll</a> take us two minutes to do it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3303.892s">And</a> it's not a different day, so it doesn't have to be re-advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3306.473s">It's</a> past the notification time, which was 7 p.m., so we're all set just if we read it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3315.987s">It's</a> advertised for the same night that we're doing the recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3318.068s">If</a> I did it tomorrow, maybe it would be a different ball game.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3478.647s">I'd</a> like to move approval with the approval of the Chairman of the Zoning Committee.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3486.091s">And</a> I'd like to just put a six-month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3490.294s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3491.034s">I</a> wish we did this a little earlier, but I do think it's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3496.217s">This</a> is still a residential neighborhood and well-intentioned and well-needed, I think.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3649.721s">And</a> this goes with the business, not with the land.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4361.547s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4362.668s">I</a> certainly see this as a whole different animal than the previous petitioner that was up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4367.171s">This</a> is a restaurant that you actually have to wait in line, get a seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4371.334s">You</a> have to show proper identification if you're going to have an alcoholic beverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4374.696s">So</a> I am totally in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4376.377s">We</a> already have establishments like Margarita's and many others throughout the community that have similar seating arrangements. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4385.843s">Pizza</a> Regina among Joe's American Bar and Grill. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4390.294s">So</a> not your average Joe's, not Joe's American Bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4393.495s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I do support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4397.536s">I</a> just want to make sure that you realize my understanding is you have to go get an extension of your liquor license now if you're going to serve alcoholic beverages on the outside extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4412.079s">Other</a> restaurants in our community have had to do that when they set up patios and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4417.3s">So</a> you want to make sure that everything's in order for insurance purposes, as well as liability with the city and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4424.042s">So</a> I'm not 150% sure on that, but I know another restaurant had to do it, I'm being told by one of my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4433.004s">So</a> I think we have to be very cognizant of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4436.405s">So</a> I second the approval, if it hasn't been done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4439.886s">And</a> then one question to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4443.407s">I</a> know there's been some confusion <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4446.785s">based</a> upon outdoor seating ordinance that this city council worked diligently upon that was put into effect maybe two or three fiscal years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4458.011s">We</a> really didn't delineate in that ordinance whether it was public property or private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4464.114s">So</a> in the past, restaurants like Petucci's wouldn't even necessarily have to come in front of the council for outdoor seating because it was their own property and they owned it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4473.517s">I</a> have pizza Regina and some of the others that I just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4477.42s">So</a> I think we have to go back and revisit the ordinance because I was under the impression at the time it was strictly to protect the city's interests as far as slip and falls on sidewalks when people had the small little chairs out there in front of restaurants like Bocelli's restaurants like muffin shop and several others up on the hillside the Danish pastry house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4501.828s">I</a> think the ordinance was more geared towards that, making sure there was a bond in place and that the city is protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4508.052s">But</a> this is a whole different animal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4509.613s">So</a> I think we should send this maybe to a licensing subcommittee to look at with the city solicitor if we want to update the ordinance where it comes to private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4519.379s">Because</a> like I said, quite honestly, these are the first two vendors we've seen, as long as I can remember, looking for outdoor seating on property that they currently own. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4528.045s">And</a> the other thing is too, we want to make sure we have a mechanism in place <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4531.782s">that</a> we don't get challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4533.762s">They're</a> here under their own will this evening saying, we're here to apply for this because the building commissioner turned around and said, you need it, or the code enforcement officer said you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4543.584s">But</a> that's his interpretation of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4546.384s">There's</a> really nothing in the law that states that they need to be here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4551.145s">There's</a> an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4552.285s">The</a> ordinance is for, this doesn't delineate, excuse me, it doesn't decipher whether it's public property or private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4562.936s">So</a> this is where, this is the first time, like I said, that you look at the other restaurants that have this currently within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4569.201s">They</a> never had to come before the city council for outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4573.084s">So</a> there could be a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4574.405s">And</a> like I said, they're just doing what the building department has told them to come forward because it was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4579.689s">But</a> quite honestly, if you get a vendor that's right in the middle of a neighborhood, that knows they're not gonna get the support of the council because it's in the middle of a neighborhood, they may say, hey, we're gonna take it to Superior Court <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4592.096s">And</a> we're going to challenge it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4593.037s">There's</a> nothing in writing that says private property, you can't have outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4596.679s">So</a> if we could at least send the question to the city solicitor on the alcohol and the extension of the license, as well as private property and outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4607.527s">Because</a> if you look at that ordinance, it was drafted for, there were certain little restaurants on Main Street, High Street, Riverside Ave that were looking for that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4625.368s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4626.508s">So</a> if we could just get a thing, but I support this wholeheartedly, but I just don't want to be challenged at some point if a restaurant opens up, you know, directly abutting a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4638.37s">Directly</a> abutting a neighborhood and then next thing you know, we're in superior court with our city solicitor because there's really no legal mechanism to <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4647.78s">to</a> fall back on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4675.945s">Did</a> that include the questions to the solicitor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4683.428s">In</a> general, not just to them, but the answer for all the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4688.069s">We</a> want to make sure there's consistency.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4693.911s">Thank</a> you for your guidance on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5088.403s">If</a> the entire council will be amenable to, we started the process of drafting an ordinance for the part-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5095.825s">The</a> mayor recently said he was going to actually make it a full-time department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5099.987s">If</a> we could amend it from the floor this evening for the word part-time put full-time, and that's just because the mayor actually said that at a recent event, and asked the city solicitor to start drafting the ordinance that this city council put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5116.328s">Because</a> right now, there's nothing, no mechanism in place to actually make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5121.329s">So...</a> So, to amend that to be a full-time position... Based on what the mayor said, a full-time position in the ordinance, and at this point, too, I mean, we can even strike out some of the language with the qualifications and all that, because that's going to be up to the personnel director, but at least get the ordinance going, because it was initiated here at the city council via a resolution recently.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5146.173s">And</a> as we know, the city council, our job is the budget, it's to create ordinances, is our two biggest functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5154.175s">So</a> if we could amend the word part-time to full-time, and that's based upon the mayor recently saying that he has the funds available somewhere to do this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5163.997s">To</a> send it to the city solicitor though, to start the ordinance drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5167.098s">Because</a> up until now, there's no mechanism in place to put this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5170.399s">So</a> when the mayor comes up with the money, at least the city council got an ordinance in place to fall back on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5178.707s">And</a> can we get a roll call vote on sending that as well?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5182.069s">Because</a> this city council has been very unanimous throughout this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5185.891s">And</a> it's glad to see that there's some working relationship with the mayor's office on this very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5194.376s">Doesn't</a> matter where it was initiated, as long as it's coming to fruition, because it's much needed in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5200.519s">And</a> you can tell that by the turnout the other evening.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5290.544s">Mr.</a> President, the original intent of the ordinance was to have remedial action taken sooner than later, and we started with the part-time, and like I said, it was unanimously supported by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5306.277s">The</a> mayor came out at a later date saying he's willing to do full-time, but as of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5311.17s">Besides</a> the press conference and besides this council going on record in support of it, there's no mechanism in place to put the person in a job with the proper personnel classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5321.194s">So</a> as Councilor Knight stated, we're still going to have to assign a classification to it as we see CAF1, ME02, ME03. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5330.198s">So</a> it's our job as city councilors to initiate and approve or deny ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5335.841s">So</a> this city council has taken the ball, and we're running with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5340.064s">And</a> I'm glad to see the mayor agrees with us that it is needed, and he went as far as to say a full-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5347.288s">So</a> for that, I am thankful.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5395.24s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5396.861s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6164.016s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6166.277s">Just</a> for the Councils, that was a homeroom petition, and the only way to get rid of it would be through another homeroom petition.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6210.341s">Were</a> you referring to the franchise fee question, or the whole, when I just answered Home Rule petition, I wasn't sure if you were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6215.344s">Franchise</a> fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6215.644s">All</a> right, that, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6216.865s">So</a> we're talking apples to apples, okay.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6218.626s">I</a> didn't know if you were talking about the, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6220.408s">Signing</a> of the 10-year contract again, which we're still waiting for the administration to respond if it's a renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6225.553s">The</a> question we asked, but I just wanted to make sure.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6267.148s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6268.649s">Thank</a> you, and thank you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this up this evening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6273.743s">So</a> after last week's meeting, we asked several questions that were waiting for answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6278.886s">One</a> of them in particular was the franchise fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6281.608s">And</a> I think at this point, we're talking about all new technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6285.63s">If</a> no one bids on the public access station, and there's not the interest out there from non-profits to do it, I'd like to ask the city solicitor if he can do some research through the FEC or whoever it is, if we could use the franchise fee for other cable related <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6302.743s">rather</a> than the public access station, like citywide Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6305.424s">A</a> lot of communities now have citywide Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6308.286s">And</a> since this discussion took place last week, there are some people that approached me, I'm sure, talked to other members of this council, that they feel that public access is good, but there is maybe a better need for the money in today's day and age, where everyone has devices that can hook up to Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6327.134s">So</a> if we could at least just ask the question, because as of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6331.028s">The</a> deadline for the bid has been extended and based upon what you hear out there, there's really not that much interest other than maybe Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6344.55s">some</a> other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6346.252s">But</a> other than that, if legally it can be used for citywide Wi-Fi or updating technology into the new schools even more than we already have, somewhere where it will have a better impact on our community and maybe the youth, the seniors, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6363.566s">If</a> we could just ask the question, I'd like to, I support your paper, but I'd like to make a B paper that we ask the solicitor to do research on where else it can be spent.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6374.303s">Amendment</a> or be paid for?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6450.578s">And</a> I definitely hear what you're saying, but I think we need to know what exactly, and you said it eloquently, Councilor Penta, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6457.14s">I</a> can be used for public access educational as well as governmental. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6461.805s">So</a> this could be used potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6464.207s">And</a> this is the question I want to ask this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6466.41s">If</a> we could use this, if there's not not the drive to get the public access done, but to improve the infrastructure for the children of our community, maybe the senior citizen centers throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6477.894s">We</a> can bring technology maybe into their buildings legally, and we might not be able to, but if we could at least ask the city solicitor to look at all these avenues, because when this topic came up last week, I've had several people, and I'm sure other people have heard similar, if not the same thing, but public access is great, but we talked about last week where technology's going, and that's why we're all gonna support, hopefully support this this evening, the 10 years, but with today's technology, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6505.232s">There's</a> probably places we could spend that money, if legally we can, that will have a better impact on the citizens of this community, be it the youth, the senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6515.817s">So</a> if we could just ask the question, we're not saying we want to do this, but if we could just ask the question so we have a better understanding on where it can be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6523.061s">So</a> can I do that as an amendment or a B paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6526.463s">As</a> a B paper with a roll call vote on both, please.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6741.588s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6742.829s">If</a> we could also ask the city solicitor the question, what happens, because I don't have a copy of the contract in front of me as I don't know any of us that do.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6751.732s">What</a> happens at the expiration date? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6755.113s">We</a> want to, I mean, we just want to make sure that they don't just turn the switch and now that everyone that subscribed to Comcast has a blackout and now <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6763.669s">You're</a> waiting for Verizon to come into every house in the community that has Comcast that's going to take two years to get up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6768.75s">So,</a> just want to find out what happens if it doesn't get signed.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6774.952s">If</a> Councilor Penta doesn't mind.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6782.094s">Is</a> that okay, Councilor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7630.345s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7633.426s">I'd</a> like to get the answer because I did look into this because I was getting several people that were interested in putting in a bid if it was for profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7645.337s">I'm</a> not so sure you can have a public access channel that is for profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7648.339s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7649.099s">I</a> would call that channel 457. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7651.161s">You</a> have to give people equal time and things like that, but you do have their out there on the country.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7659.366s">We</a> got to check the FCC regulations and see if, uh, if you can, because like I said, I know people that are interested in doing it, um, quite honestly for profit, but nonprofit is actually, which makes it a vibrant part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7672.914s">And</a> it's not for business, it's not to make money and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7676.697s">So</a> if we could ask that question as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7683.744s">And</a> then the B paper is looking into where else the money can be spent in lieu of the public access, if the city needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7691.23s">Senior</a> housing, internet accessibility citywide, Wi-Fi.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7708.987s">And</a> our technology upgrades to the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7711.769s">And</a> if it can be for-profit according to FCC regulations and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7722.458s">Because</a> I'm not a lawyer, but I would think it has to be non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7727.982s">I</a> would think.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7762.493s">Comcast's</a> website actually says on it that it has to be non-profit according to FCC regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7768.702s">For</a> them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7771.377s">Comcast,</a> I'm sure it's similar with Verizon, ICN.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10150.628s">One</a> thing we have to be cognizant of the fact is if we <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10156.172s">pay</a> the money to get out of this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10159.513s">We</a> are still, as a community, going to own the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10162.414s">We're</a> going to own the kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10164.675s">And</a> then at that point, we could bring in someone maybe from another community that has done this, like Cambridge or Boston, and then do it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10178.841s">But</a> I think we... I'm just not there quite yet, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10185.115s">I'm</a> not there quite yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10188.376s">But</a> in the right hands, with the city being in control of the whole program, with the state-of-the-art equipment, that's what they call it, not what I've seen firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10205.558s">But</a> if we did make the investment, like Councilor Marks said, whether it was on a portion of it or the whole thing, it's not like we're going to scrap the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10215.408s">and</a> just waste $800,000 of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10219.71s">We're</a> still gonna have some equity and we're gonna have some assets that come along with all the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10226.673s">And</a> I do believe that if the right person, if we had a department head here running this program, that that was their job, not the chief of police who's taxed upon too frequently to deal with this when we have real situations going on in the community that need to be dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10245.075s">But</a> to be honest, I'm just not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10247.877s">I</a> agree with what Councilor Lungo-Koehn said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10251.319s">This</a> has been a winter that we haven't experienced in ever, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10258.544s">State</a> of emergency over three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10260.125s">We're</a> trying to get money from Washington because of the amount of snow that we've got from back to back to back storms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10267.589s">The</a> city hasn't been able to focus as much time on this as they should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10273.568s">The</a> mayor should have never started this program in January, whether it was snowing out, no snow, I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10281.071s">Unless</a> we were south of North Carolina, this program should not have started in the midst of a New England winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10291.394s">This</a> should have started when people were out in a short-sleeved shirt with a pair of Bermuda shorts on, and they could take their time at the kiosk, learn it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10302.633s">Not</a> going over snow banks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10309.075s">You</a> throw the snow into this mix, and it's been hectic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10314.196s">There's</a> a car on Barner Ave that hasn't moved since the snowstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10318.037s">Hasn't</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10318.637s">It's</a> right around number 18, 14, right around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10324.618s">You're</a> still dealing with snow banks on all the side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10327.519s">The</a> streets are not back to an acceptable width at no fault of the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10332.863s">But</a> with that being said, I'd like to give it a little bit further to see what they can change. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10342.065s">But</a> Councilor Marks is 100% right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10344.706s">He's</a> 100% right when he says there's not any for-profit company that is not out to make the dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10352.288s">It's</a> all about dollars and cents and bringing in the dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10356.529s">Let's</a> not anyone fool you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10358.209s">And</a> that's going to be the same thing if we go for a for-profit TV channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10362.823s">for</a> public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10363.704s">It's</a> gonna be the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10365.004s">It's</a> gonna be the biggest person that pays the most money to get their advertisement on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10369.527s">So,</a> when you're dealing with for-profit companies, like Councilor Mark said, everything's out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10376.952s">Decisions</a> are made in the boardroom when they're looking at graphs and data and pie charts, and what they wanna do is make those pie charts bigger and bigger and bigger under one of the categories, and that's income. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10390.255s">They</a> want to make the income go up and the expenses go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10393.997s">That's</a> any for-profit company in the United States, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10400.139s">The</a> only time that they want to start slowing down on the revenues is when their tax guy tells them, hey, you're at a point now, why don't you slow down on the revenues? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10407.261s">And</a> they're not doing it because they want to give the Medford person a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10411.523s">It's</a> because they're being advised by their business people to start slowing down for tax ramification reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10420.434s">But</a> like I said, at this point, coming off this winter, starting a program that should not have been started in the midst of a winter, I think the mayor was 150% wrong on that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10435.964s">I</a> don't know how he came to that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10437.765s">I</a> think a lot of it was this council, as well as the business community and people looking for the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10445.471s">And</a> quite honestly, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10449.864s">Let's</a> call it like it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10451.345s">This</a> isn't a program you wanted to start three months before the people are getting out to make a determination on who the leaders of this community should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10459.81s">And</a> I'm not saying that that had any bearing on this decision whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10464.953s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, it started during a time that it should not have been started. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10471.017s">I</a> think we have to give it at least, at least, another month to see where we go now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10477.041s">I</a> don't even want to say we're out of the <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10480.051s">We're</a> out of the realm of snow because we are in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10483.592s">But</a> now that the snow is thawing, I think we're going to have a better understanding on exactly where the program can be improved, where it cannot be improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10494.075s">We've</a> dealt with a lot of these same issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10495.995s">You</a> look back to some of the bigger issues throughout the community since I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10500.476s">And</a> we had the water meter situation where people weren't letting us in their houses to change the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10506.137s">And</a> you had to take baby steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10508.772s">And</a> ultimately they figured out how to work together and have the person gain access to the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10513.815s">Then</a> it was the recycling bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10516.457s">People</a> were up in arms over the recycling bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10519.118s">It</a> was as if we were telling people, you can't throw any trash away and we're going to start charging you for trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10524.401s">That</a> was ultimately the way we perceived it, and that's how the people felt at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10531.906s">But</a> as you drive around this community on any given trash day now, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10535.46s">Everyone</a> said we're not going to have enough room for trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10537.361s">We're</a> definitely not going to have enough room, and I need seven barrels for my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10541.123s">If</a> you don't have a two-family, you see very few and far between people that have out two trash bins that they're paying an extra fee to have that extra barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10548.707s">Few</a> and far between. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10549.768s">I</a> mean, I challenge anyone to say differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10553.79s">I</a> mean, that's a fact as you drive around our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10556.723s">The</a> other things, other major things over this community that I've been here for the past 16 years, the building of the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10563.768s">There</a> was a lot of animosity, a lot of pushback on it, but over time, over time, people got to like them, and now people are just thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10573.594s">We</a> were talking earlier tonight about possibly using money to put more technology in the schools if the city thinks that there's a better use of that money rather than the public access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10583.908s">So,</a> but I'm just, I'm referring to some of the major, major stumbling blocks that were, you would have thought that the world was coming to an end during some of those issues here in our community because of the complaints and everything else we heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10598.675s">But</a> as a community, everyone worked together and got to the point where they may not have loved the trash program, the new schools, this or that, but at least it was acceptable and tolerated for lack of a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10613.413s">I</a> think we have to be cognizant of the fact that we have to be open and fair to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10620.456s">And</a> at the appropriate time, I have no problem whatsoever taking a vote when I feel the end all be all and they're just totally out of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10629.299s">And</a> let's be honest right now too, if we tried to go after them legally and say we want to suspend the contract and Mark Rumley has to go to Middlesex Superior Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10637.787s">and</a> say it's because they don't have magnets on the back of their truck that say stay back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10641.808s">Don't</a> even spend the $250 filing fee, because we're going to get laughed right out of that courtroom, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10648.09s">And</a> when we hear, when the business owners and stuff, the judges are going to want to hear that, our jury or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10654.172s">They're</a> going to want to know where the city was financially damaged by it and by the things, the citizens are financially damaged because of the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10663.495s">But</a> as of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10664.818s">I</a> just don't think that they're in breach of contract enough where it would stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10668.281s">I'm</a> not an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10669.101s">We</a> have one of the finest city solicitors in the Commonwealth, if not the United States, that works within our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10674.065s">That</a> if and when it comes to that time, him and his assistant city solicitor would be going to bat for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10683.612s">But</a> I just don't think we're there at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10685.854s">I'm</a> starting to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10687.755s">So</a> I'm going to cease my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10691.978s">But</a> I cannot support it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10694.633s">But</a> I am getting closer to be able to take a vote in good faith that the program may not be in the best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10704.644s">But</a> I think people have to realize that it's not as Councilor Caraviello said, we're going to just shell away 800,000, 900,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10712.169s">It</a> would be more that we're acquiring equipment, we're acquiring assets, and then it would be something like Councilor Marks stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10719.014s">You</a> bring in someone for $75,000, $80,000 a year that knows parking management. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10724.238s">I</a> mean, Councilor Marks traversed this whole area with Ronnie DeFranco and the Chief and Gwendolyn Blackburn when they were going to surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10732.765s">There's</a> people that specialize in just this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10735.967s">Just</a> this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10737.328s">Somerville</a> can do it, Cambridge can do it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10741.309s">You</a> know what the difference is? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10744.27s">And</a> I think... I can say this now because I'm not on the ballot in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10751.111s">The</a> fact of the matter is, Mr. President, you go to Cambridge, you're paying the park to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10757.432s">Or</a> you're paying the park to go into jury duty at the courthouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10760.773s">You're</a> paying the park to actually go to something that you have to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10767.108s">The</a> problem right now we're having is people are paying to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10771.831s">We</a> have to do more as a community to bring in more quality businesses to help sustain these other smaller businesses that are having a hard time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10778.474s">It's</a> not a result of the parking that bestsellers went out of business or Ward's Gift is closing their doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10783.817s">This</a> just started. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10784.538s">It</a> may be a convenient excuse for people to say that that's why the business is a <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10789.015s">We</a> have to do more as a community to bring people in that are going to want to pay the quarter to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10794.278s">We're</a> starting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10795.039s">We've</a> got Carol's Diner in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10797.78s">He's</a> booming on the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10801.722s">We</a> have to do more as a community to bring people to these centers and towns and squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10811.023s">All</a> too often, there's too many storefronts that are vacant, and I haven't really heard much from the mayor on giving tax credits to bring in quality businesses and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10821.366s">Malden,</a> the one business that I think we've did that for was Hof's Bakery. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10827.367s">Hof's</a> Bakery got a break on their tax obligations because they were hiring X amount of people, they were staying here, and what did they just do? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10834.689s">They're</a> moving to Malden because <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10837.685s">Maldon's</a> got an incentive for them to go there, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10839.826s">Whether</a> it's the landlord, whether it's the city, whatever it may be, they're moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10845.17s">This</a> is the stuff that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10847.191s">Medford</a> Square, we've been talking about the Medford Square revitalization for as long as... I was at the Gleason School when they were talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10854.476s">That</a> was probably the first study. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10856.057s">When</a> I was at the Gleason School in 1989, 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10857.137s">This</a> is where we have to get aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10861.847s">We</a> have to get aggressive and make people want to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10864.15s">And</a> this is not being insultive to the businesses that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10870.219s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10872.122s">But</a> I said it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10873.945s">We</a> have to do something with the liquor licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10876.812s">The</a> liquor license, the 99s and the Texas Roadhouses and the rest of them, those are middle of the road places. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10883.273s">They</a> don't even look at Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10884.493s">They</a> don't even look at Medford because you have to have a burger in order to have a beverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10890.955s">And</a> these are the things that we have to do as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10894.375s">And</a> this council has been working towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10900.156s">This</a> evening, we granted a few licenses that hopefully <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10903.43s">Help</a> out the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10905.03s">But</a> this city has to be more forward thinking when it comes to bringing in quality businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10910.451s">You</a> can only talk about station landing for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10913.332s">It's</a> like the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10914.952s">Stations</a> landing was a great improvement to that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10917.812s">But</a> how many years ago was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10921.073s">10,</a> 12 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10923.113s">We</a> have to start looking to do more things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10926.494s">You</a> got Shaw's Supermarket down here, which is an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10930.515s">It</a> was a snow pile for <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10932.624s">For</a> the whole winter, you gotta dodge snowbanks to go to Eastern Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10937.063s">In</a> the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10939.199s">But</a> I'm sorry I'm getting off topic a little bit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10942.081s">But</a> that's where we got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10944.703s">We</a> got to do more as a community on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10946.084s">And</a> that starts at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10947.405s">That</a> starts with the city administration working with his OCD director. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10950.768s">And</a> let's not kid ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10951.929s">I</a> often feel bad for our OCD director. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10954.531s">And</a> I'm going to finish on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10955.812s">I</a> often feel bad on our OCD director when sometimes this council or members of this council or the council in general or people in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10964.756s">may</a> say they don't do a thing or this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10967.338s">That's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10968.458s">They're</a> doing what the person in the corner office is giving them the green light to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10974.141s">Whether</a> it's fair or unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10975.361s">Our</a> OCD director in this community is Michael McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10979.063s">He's</a> our OCD director slash mayor slash traffic enforcement guy slash treasurer collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10984.106s">So</a> anyone that thinks any different, you're sadly mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10988.708s">But</a> that's enough on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10990.889s">But</a> as far as this, I cannot support it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10993.641s">But</a> I think in due time, if it continues this way, Mr. President, I'm sorry for being long-winded, but I think it's a bigger picture we have to focus on than rather just this parking.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11137.659s">Well,</a> Councilor Caraviello's motion is calling to send this to the Committee of the Whole within 14 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11145.325s">As</a> a council, I think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11148.187s">Rather</a> than take the vote this evening, would you respectfully <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11151.678s">Put</a> it aside for 14 days, it's totally your prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11154.819s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11220.413s">Point</a> of information, I was referring to the snow emergency that was in effect.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11227.157s">It</a> was a three-week emergency, unheard of, that's the leadership.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11308.273s">But</a> you may have the votes for it at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11310.654s">Well,</a> maybe at a later date, we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11312.655s">Councilor</a> Knight?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11407.47s">I</a> would ask you, is this in proper form to be voted on at this point, where it's not our jurisdiction? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11414.673s">The</a> mayor is the signatory authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11419.215s">I</a> just asked the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11422.276s">Another</a> paper of this nature was ruled out of order a few weeks ago, and then it was withdrawn by the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11429.899s">So</a> I'm just asking for the consistency.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11451.755s">Motion</a> a table then, until we have that meeting, which is undebatable.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11460.201s">What</a> does that do to the D paper that we have for Councilor Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11463.744s">You</a> can call a meeting at any time and hopefully you respect his wishes within 14 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11475.47s">The</a> President knows what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11477.932s">Fourteen</a> days, have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11480.354s">Call</a> the roll for the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11482.295s">Motion</a> to table.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12038.883s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12039.983s">Thank</a> you, and as we know, $143,000, really, with this stuff, like the Council has stated, isn't going to get us far. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12048.085s">It's</a> going to be very helpful for potholes and things of that nature, but look at Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12052.165s">When</a> they actually ground it down and actually did the job, it's very limited what this is going to get us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12058.927s">I'm</a> glad that this council <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12060.442s">I</a> took a vote last week under the leadership of Councilor Penta, or two weeks ago, to appropriate, or at least ask the Mayor to appropriate a million dollars of the taxpayers' money that's in an account right now, unencumbered. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12073.357s">Very,</a> very important word. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12074.959s">Not</a> encumbered. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12076.732s">It</a> could be used for any purpose with a vote of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12080.896s">So</a> the $143,000 is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12082.938s">But</a> if the mayor puts $1.143 million on the table to do this community, you're going to see that get us some places. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12090.305s">So</a> once again, this council is bringing forward good ideas as far as I'm concerned.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12474.421s">Move</a> approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12476.214s">They</a> were going to do it themselves, but it's nasty, so they don't want to touch it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12486.48s">One</a> more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12488.141s">City</a> Hall really is, if I may, falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12491.923s">We</a> had this beautiful event here Sunday with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12496.405s">And</a> when the gentlemen that were here walked into the second floor men's room, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12501.594s">That</a> bathroom has been covered with caution tape, the urinal, for about two and a half months. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12508.237s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12509.017s">If</a> it's beyond repair, if it's beyond repair, take it out, cap off the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12517.061s">This</a> is a basic plumbing job.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12520.202s">Very</a> basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12520.803s">We</a> can get someone at Minuteman, Volk could come up here and do that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12528.253s">I'm</a> speechless. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12529.094s">I'm</a> speechless for once. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12531.235s">You</a> would think that you'd want to get the building ready for those type of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12536.039s">I</a> mean, I understand not every office in this city hall has their own private bathroom in it, like the mayor's office, but for us little people that have to use the public restroom, it's disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12549.229s">If</a> we can get that fixed.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12763.433s">But</a> my question is, I think it's fairly simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12767.515s">I</a> think I got a good understanding of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12771.757s">Was</a> there a roll call vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12772.637s">If</a> there wasn't a roll call vote, you could have... There was a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12774.658s">There</a> was a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12777.9s">I</a> know exactly what I said.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12816.862s">Does</a> the MMA, on the particular issue you guys are talking about, whatever it is, does the MMA have an official position on it?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12855.264s">That's</a> the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12857.654s">Why</a> is this hooky? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12858.735s">It's</a> not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12859.515s">I</a> didn't make a big deal that he did.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12943.348s">There's</a> a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12946.87s">How</a> do you present the records? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12947.791s">That's</a> my question.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA/2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA.html">Medford City Council - March 17, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=47.475s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=49.636s">The</a> past couple of years, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=53.7s">There</a> has been an increase of substance abuse overdoses and other issues throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=60.502s">I'd</a> like to have the city solicitor draft an ordinance, putting it into the personnel ordinance section of our local ordinances so that come budget time or come time to do the community development block grant funding, which is going to be in the next month or so, I'm sure we'll be having our portion, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=84.0s">that</a> there's an actual ordinance in place, and if the mayor doesn't see fit to sign off on this ordinance, as we all know, a two-thirds vote of this council would be able to override it anyway, if it's something that we all seem serious about, which I'm sure we are based upon the talk around here for the last few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=103.806s">So</a> I'd like to actually make this an ordinance, and if the mayor signs it, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=107.632s">I'm</a> sure he will take a hard look at it and if he sees it, that it's a good expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=113.214s">The</a> language that I got for this is based upon the language of all the different surrounding communities that do have a part-time coordinator in their area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=123.078s">Most</a> of the cities I looked at had a minimum of 20 hours per week, but I figured where we have the long day Wednesday, if you could have someone here three days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=131.661s">And</a> as far as the experience, that would be up to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=136.01s">But</a> I just think you need someone that really has experience in the field, and it has to be an appointment that's made with due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=143.253s">But</a> that's certainly up to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=145.134s">So</a> I'd like to do this by way of ordinance, so that if the mayor doesn't see fit to do it, he can leave it unfunded in his budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=151.878s">But</a> that will tell us where he really stands on the issue, if there is an ordinance change in the personnel charts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=158.366s">And</a> this is a great starting point for our discussions tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=162.768s">If</a> we want to, I'd like to get the ball rolling with budgets coming up for the ordinance change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=167.63s">But</a> if people want to talk about this further tomorrow night, I would refer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=171.611s">But</a> if people want to vote on this this evening, we can do it this evening too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=175.313s">But</a> I would say time is of the essence, just where budget's starting to roll around and community development block grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=181.135s">But</a> certainly by putting it off one night for further discussion, I'm not opposed to that at all.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=201.568s">Boston's</a> doing something right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=204.411s">Bill</a> Ricka has one in place, as well as Woburn is talking about it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=210.336s">And</a> if you follow the Northwest Weekly, it's something in the Boston Globe on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=214.12s">It's</a> something that most, I shouldn't say most, that would be speaking out of turn, but a lot of the cities and towns around here are doing similar things, but Billerica really is the leading one around here, and that's former Mayor John Curran out of Woburn, who's in the process, if not, they either just hired the person, or are in the process of hiring them right now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=623.594s">Thank</a> you very much to all my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=626.155s">I</a> think it's great to send this to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=628.375s">Just</a> a couple of points that I'd just like to add to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=631.476s">This</a> isn't specific to the large opiate addiction that we currently have in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=637.677s">This</a> is also for treatment, people that may be suffering from using other substances that may be drugs, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=645.02s">So</a> it's more of a substance abuse coordinator for all substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=650.164s">That's</a> the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=651.404s">The</a> second thing is, the mayor always saw fit that it was a very important position in our community when his friend Mr. Averbrook had the job of Medford Saving Lives director. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=660.551s">Unfortunately,</a> due to the untiming passing of Ben, who was very well respected in this community, that job has not been filled in some years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=669.957s">This</a> may be an opportunity where the person that does this job can also encompass <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=674.71s">the</a> Medford Saving Lives program, which has been left unfilled by the mayor for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=682.492s">And</a> then last but not least, one thing that I know that is a huge thing when it comes to substance abuse, it's the beds out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=689.014s">It's</a> for treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=690.254s">We</a> all know Long Island just closed due to the bridge situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=694.935s">Mayor</a> Walsh had to take that out of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=697.756s">But</a> the biggest thing, I think, if this comes forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=701.775s">Well,</a> not the biggest thing, because it's a unified approach with all the different areas, treatment, education, prevention, and intervention services, but an open dialogue between the community and the area hospitals to find out what resources are available on a given day, because all too often, someone's ready to make that step to go into a detox center or a hospital, and unless they're dual diagnosis with a psychiatric problem as well as a substance abuse problem, they just aren't the beds out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=730.95s">exact</a> right time where they say, oh yes, come on over to McLean Hospital, come on over here, come to Whittier Pavilion, whatever hospital it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=738.915s">But</a> an ongoing dialogue between the local hospitals and the city so that you know and you have a count of what resources are available at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=748.921s">The</a> second thing is the continuum of care right now at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and Hallmark Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=755.065s">They're</a> doing a pilot program right now under a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=757.827s">I'm</a> sure most of us are aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=760.05s">where</a> they're actually, they're focusing on back pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=762.611s">When</a> someone comes in with back pain, and back pain is one of those things that you really can't diagnose, but when someone comes in and they're in severe pain, they're in severe pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=772.256s">But</a> Hallmark's approach in their continuum of care at this point, and they're studying it in a trial moving forward, they're given a maximum of three days worth of painkillers, and then they have to follow up with their primary care or a specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=787.744s">So</a> Hallmark Health is definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=790.178s">in</a> the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=791.299s">I</a> think we're going to hear a little bit more from Middlesex District Attorney Marion Ryan soon on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=797.644s">I</a> can't speak for her, but I think that she's acknowledged that this is a huge problem in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=804.289s">And</a> I think they'll be focused around here a little bit in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=811.874s">And</a> the other thing is too, and I'll discuss this tomorrow night, the Narcan, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=817.327s">which</a> we all know is the substance for, it's actually for opiates. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=821.93s">But</a> I think that's something that we should work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=826.193s">Whatever</a> it may be, if it's through contract negotiations, whether it's through, whatever the avenues are, we should look to make sure that our professionals have access to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=835.44s">And</a> if it means contract negotiations and doing it, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=841.804s">But</a> this is all stuff we can talk about tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=845.097s">But</a> I just want to reiterate, I thank my council colleagues for taking this very, very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=849.94s">I</a> think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=852.081s">We</a> realize that alcohol and other substances is a part of this community, that we want to be there and help people out when they've surrendered to this awful disease.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1065.517s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1066.497s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1067.197s">Can</a> we also ask the same question if Councilor Penta's okay to ask the DA's office and the state police? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1071.858s">Because</a> we have a lot of areas in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1073.962s">that</a> are patrolled by the state police, and I know we have had overdoses up at Mystic Lakes, up at the Sheepfold, and different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1079.845s">So</a> that may be additional numbers that we're not necessarily looking at, because they don't necessarily all the time call EMS, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1089.531s">People</a> refuse it, then they get arrested. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1092.573s">As</a> amended by Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1150.802s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1152.643s">The</a> last few <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1154.209s">months,</a> last weeks, we've been focused on other areas that we just discussed and other things that have been important in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1160.851s">I</a> think long overdue, the city actually having a mentoring program where you can work with Rotary, Kiwanis, private business, city hall employees, city employees, just regular volunteers, people that are willing to spend some time and be a mentor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1180.155s">As</a> we all know, there's a lot of broken families in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1183.104s">People</a> coming from single parent families, kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1186.205s">And</a> if we can start with kids that are about seven, eight years old and mentor them right through. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1191.287s">I</a> know Boston has a program that Mayor Walsh just initiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1194.908s">And</a> I believe he's looking for 1,000 mentors with a big handful of them being Boston City employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1200.85s">But</a> if we can do it on a smaller scale in Medford, maybe start with 50 people, I think that that's a goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1207.272s">But</a> it's up to the mayor to put this in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1209.846s">And</a> I don't see any reason why we can't with the size of our city and the committed people we have throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1216.389s">The</a> mayor made phone calls asking people for donations just last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1220.571s">Maybe</a> he can pick up the phone and call the same people and see if they're interested in getting a mentoring program off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1226.613s">And</a> I, as one member of the city council, and I'm sure all of us are, would be more than willing to help him any way we can.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1665.098s">No,</a> not for now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2521.49s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2523.871s">I</a> would just, as we're looking at this, I think we have to be very realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2529.015s">We</a> heard it loud and clear over the past five years, people wanted Verizon, people wanted the opportunity to go out and choose which cable provider that they would like to subscribe to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2539.781s">And</a> so, I actually support the renewal of the contract, just based upon giving people the opportunity to make a <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2549.458s">on</a> what provider they would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2551.018s">I</a> don't see any reason why, though, they can't open this up at this point to other vendors that may be interested and not just exclusively Verizon and Comcast or Xfinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2562.22s">But</a> like I said, this is something this city council called for for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2567.121s">Competition,</a> competition, competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2569.541s">And</a> if this doesn't get renewed, I would think that competition is now by the wayside in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2577.003s">I</a> don't know that to be 100% true, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2578.902s">It</a> sort of makes sense just based upon the contract not being renewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2582.824s">At</a> some point, Comcast would no longer be available to be subscribed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2589.768s">So,</a> I just think we've got to think about that because we were very adamant. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2594.891s">Councilor</a> Marks, do you remember how many years it was? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2596.932s">Councilor</a> Carr was on the Council when we were trying to get Verizon in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2601.074s">It's</a> been that long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2603.315s">So,</a> competition is good for the consumer.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2814.334s">Yes,</a> I'd also like Director Burke, if I can make a motion, to provide us with the last four consecutive fiscal years of franchise fees that came into this community as a result of a 1987 vote or 88 vote of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2828.945s">There's</a> nothing that says we have to keep that in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2832.748s">Members</a> of this Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2834.821s">if</a> we wanted to can do away with the franchise fee on the monthly bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2838.104s">Now</a> we have to be obvious, we obviously have to be aware that there are many good programs that are funded through it, teachers in the school system and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2847.935s">But</a> I'd like to see four years worth of franchise fees and then we can take a serious look at if it's something that we want to continue as a practice here in the city of Medford.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2897.37s">And</a> I think this is this is playing into the whole picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2899.352s">We</a> asked for the transfers last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2901.213s">We're</a> actually holding in on the budget now to see where there could be some savings, where in the past we haven't asked for some of this empirical data. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2909.299s">Thank</a> you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2910.24s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3751.44s">The</a> peg access is what pays for the school committee and the city council as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3757.185s">And</a> we all know as we traverse this community, how many people watch these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3761.108s">And</a> a portion of it is funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3763.492s">And</a> so once again, I think Councilor Alango-Kern has a great idea, seeing exactly how much of it is paying for Monday nights and Tuesday nights and how much is getting paid elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3774.176s">But</a> TV3 or whatever the public access station is one portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3780.278s">The</a> PEG stands for public education and government. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3783.139s">We</a> still have a government channel and we have an education component. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3786.66s">Right</a> now, the P for public access is missing, but there still is two other channels that are funded through that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4057.999s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4059.861s">I</a> can see where this is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4060.922s">I</a> would anticipate that the mayor is going to say that where this is a renewal, he doesn't need the Medford City Council, as Councilor Caraviello pointed out in his wise wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4072.993s">He</a> doesn't need the City Council to give him the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4076.253s">So,</a> I think at this point, we should go and temporarily, for the next 60 days, rescind the original vote that was taken under, I believe it had to be under City Manager Galoni at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4089.221s">Because</a> this is technically a renewal, it's not a new contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4092.263s">So,</a> if we rescind the original vote where the council gave approval... No, no, but it's been a renewal, a renewal, a renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4101.808s">The</a> original vote that gave the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4105.182s">the</a> green light to move forward of a plus three year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4109.944s">I</a> think this city council should take a vote to temporarily rescind it so that he cannot go and sign this tomorrow morning while we're waiting for the city clerk to do his due diligence and pull the original paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4121.689s">Does</a> it make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4123.93s">Because</a> this is a renewal and the administration is going to come back and say, I don't need your consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4128.492s">You</a> gave it to me on the original contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4132.786s">Do</a> you see what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4134.387s">Where</a> if that vote's rescinded, he can only negotiate a maximum of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4139.25s">And</a> it, it sounds to me by listening to the council colleague, my council colleagues, no one's really comfortable with a 10-year deal at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4147.515s">So</a> then.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4149.036s">Are</a> we authorized to rescind something that old? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4151.797s">We</a> can rescind anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4152.778s">Cause</a> he's, he, whatever vote he's banking on saying that he has the authority to do it, that should be rescinded by this council temporarily for 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4161.733s">until</a> we find out where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4164.515s">So,</a> is that in the form of a motion, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4167.277s">That</a> is in the form of a motion.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4169.338s">So,</a> on the motion... Well, at least until... At least rescind it until April 15th, is it?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4181.907s">The</a> only thing we can rescind is the original vote giving him the authority to go over three-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4190.066s">But</a> I agree with that, but I'm afraid tomorrow morning he'll sign this contract knowing that the council's looking for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4201.233s">Well,</a> if he thinks he can't get his 10-year deal... Can we rescind it for seven days? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4213.982s">Rescind</a> it for seven days? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4215.423s">Will</a> you support rescinding it for seven days? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4219.277s">the</a> original authority for the mayor to negotiate over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4223.98s">But</a> Ed Finn just told me it's still in effect.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4361.595s">The</a> council council president, mr. Councilor Camuso has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4366.357s">I'm</a> going to, uh, I'm going to withdraw that original motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4368.999s">I'm</a> going to make a motion that the city solicitor advises this council on the original paper and respectfully ask the mayor not to sign the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4377.078s">until</a> the city solicitor's opinion is back before the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4380.399s">And</a> if he goes forward and signs it, full well knowing that the council at this point, just speaking, and I'm not so sure if I'm far against the 10-year contract, but it sounds like several members are, are not far going out, but at least if he signs it between now and then, where we had since December 18th to now, and we're asking for seven days, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4401.898s">I</a> think that would be unfair for him to do that at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4412.285s">On,</a> on the, to, um, and the city clerk to furnish this council with the original vote that gave the mayor the authority not to negotiate with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4423.652s">Well,</a> it could be Comcast or the authority to negotiation with a cable service provider for over 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4429.996s">And</a> it has to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4431.44s">broader</a> for all cable companies, because the mayor did not need a vote of the city council to give a 10-year contract to Verizon.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6259.648s">Can</a> we also ask that the city administration to provide with this data <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6263.767s">the</a> amount of snow emergency days that were called since this program started? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6270.431s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6270.531s">Because</a> those particular days, there was no parking on the main streets, legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6276.754s">But</a> we have a snow emergency like no other community that I've ever seen where you just keep it on and on and on with no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6283.157s">But</a> if we could just ask that question.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg/2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg.html">Medford City Council - March 10, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=674.845s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=676.126s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=678.688s">Unfortunately,</a> I'm a little bit saddened that the administration didn't pursue participating in the survey, which may have told the state what our needs were. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=687.433s">And</a> sometimes the state uses this type of data when it comes to funding purposes for cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=694.698s">But</a> with that being said, I'm not surprised that he just let it sit on a disc or go on a shredder or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=701.174s">With</a> that being said, I do support this this evening, and I'm not gonna tell Councilor Penta what to do, but I'd like to make that, if you make the motion, I'd support it, the million dollars out of certified free cash to repair the roadways throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=715.24s">So</a> you're gonna bring that up? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=716.48s">You</a> wanna do that now? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=717.521s">And</a> I'd second that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=726.724s">To</a> repair the roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=728.895s">And</a> last but not least, as I said earlier, I'd just like to commend the councilor as well as Councilor Lungo-Koehn for being forward thinking with the 311 system that she brought up a little while ago that this council supported because these are tools that the administration could use if they wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=749.741s">But</a> we're talking about an administration that doesn't have a fire department that has email throughout the entire department, picks and chooses who has it, as well as an administration that doesn't have voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=759.115s">So,</a> certainly, I'm not that surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=761.816s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1423.058s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1425.119s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1426.86s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1428.421s">The</a> mayor has a wonderful asset, too, in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1431.003s">We</a> all know Stephanie Muccini-Burke, who was a stalwart as a councilor, and she was all about accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1437.135s">And</a> if the mayor can't figure this out, he can just reach across his office and maybe ask her to bring some of her leadership thoughts forward on this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1445.337s">Because</a> as I said, we all know that she was all about holding people accountable when she was a city councillor, and she brings so much to that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1454.64s">So</a> if he can't figure it out, maybe he can get some of his staff to maybe look into the 311 or some type of similar product that may be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1465.984s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1467.518s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1684.464s">This</a> includes the million dollars
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1796.634s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1798.094s">While</a> we're under suspension, I'd like to, if my council colleagues don't mind, I think a report of all the transfers internally that have taken place from July 1st up to say February, the end of February, would give us a good idea on where the mayor's transferring money within the budget and will prepare us to start looking at next year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1820.158s">But</a> as we know, the only transfers that need to come before the council, if it's for a totally <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1825.929s">different</a> line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1827.369s">So</a> there's so many transfers that take place on a daily if not weekly basis within the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1834.231s">I</a> think we should have a good picture because we know that there's positions within the budget right now that have been funded that still have no one in the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1842.052s">DPW</a> director is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1844.233s">It's</a> over $100,000 a year job and the individual is being paid three days a week because it's a part-time so-called contract employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1853.615s">It's</a> a retiree. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1854.867s">that's</a> currently doing the job rather than the, um, so, so I'd like to see where that money for that salary has went. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1862.832s">So,</a> uh, if we could ask the administration by the way of a resolve to provide us with all transfers that have taken place amongst, um, all the departments internally, and most of this will be the DPW, we'll be doing it from one line item to another line item that may have went to the overtime line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1880.223s">But</a> I think it's incumbent upon us to look at that as we get ready to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1883.439s">to</a> come into budget time so we can actually have a realistic look on where the mayor is moving the money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1889.481s">So</a> I'd like to get a roll call vote on that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1932.703s">And</a> if we could also ask for the other report that we get, where exactly we are financially six months plus into the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1940.089s">We</a> used to get a report every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1941.57s">We</a> haven't been seeing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1943.112s">So</a> I just think we need a clear picture to realize how much money is being moved around. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1947.422s">internally,</a> because there may be areas that the mayor may want to add a line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1951.343s">Hey,</a> instead of moving the money around every year, maybe I want to do this or do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1955.084s">And</a> realistically, that's when we can look at it and see if we think there should be a reduction in the line item, an addition in the line item, because we're not seeing those transfers that take place during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1966.047s">The</a> only transfers we technically usually see are the major ones that come to us June 20th, June 26th for moving major money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1974.349s">But</a> for instance, the police <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1977.56s">overtime</a> budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1978.601s">I'm</a> sure that that's close to in the arrears, if not in the arrears, and they have to fund it some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1984.046s">So</a> there's another line item somewhere within the budget that they would allocate money from. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1988.089s">So</a> I think this would be a very good tool for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1990.711s">And</a> then we may want to ask for this again in like three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1994.074s">But</a> I'd like to put the last day of February as a date because those are transfers that have already taken place and we can actually see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2002.161s">And</a> then maybe at the end of this month we'll ask for another one and another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2006.117s">because</a> I'm sure there's areas within the budget that are underfunded or overfunded that funds are being allocated from different line items.

<a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2897.648s">People</a> are using just to numb their feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2900.649s">And</a> that's why, in recovery, they say, if you're an alcoholic, don't pick up the marijuana, or pick up this, or do that, or do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2906.593s">Or</a> if you're an intravenous drug user and you stop doing that, don't pick up the Budweiser, because you're just substituting your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2916.398s">These</a> are the things no one wants to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2918.739s">But</a> I got nine, 10 months left on this city council before I retire. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2922.605s">And</a> this is something that I'm going to follow through on and make it my mission to have the city step up, have the city put funding behind this, not just press conferences, but actual places that families and substance abuse users can go to when they're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2937.902s">Because</a> no one's kidding anyone, until you are ready, until you are ready and surrender, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2944.823s">You</a> can have anything in front of you, and all these families out here can relate, anything at all in front of you, and you're gonna choose the booze, the heroin, the pills, whatever it may be, you're gonna choose that, because ultimately it takes control of your life, takes control of your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2962.793s">And</a> I wouldn't have believed this until I confronted my disease, because it's awful easy to look outside and throw glasses and use the word junkie or a drunk, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2974.087s">I</a> wrote my wife a nice letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2975.908s">You</a> know what I always thought the alcoholic was, the drunk? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2978.35s">The</a> guy at Harvard Square sitting there with a brown paper bag, with a brown paper bag, drinking and collecting cans to go and buy the next bottle of booze. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2987.196s">I</a> didn't think it was someone that was a city councilor for 16 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2990.378s">I</a> didn't think it was someone that worked for the Sheriff's Department for 18 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2995.161s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2996.622s">It</a> doesn't discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2998.725s">does</a> not discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2999.685s">We</a> have members of this community that are suffering so much that end up killing themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3004.747s">Killing</a> themselves because they're in so much pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3007.788s">Pick</a> up the obituaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3009.089s">Not</a> everyone says alcoholism or drug abuse or this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3014.371s">But</a> we know people that have committed suicide and were struggling with this very disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3018.292s">And</a> they took that route rather than letting everyone else down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3022.814s">Because</a> when you're in a state <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3024.318s">and</a> you feel like your disease got you by the grip, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3030.583s">You'd</a> rather be dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3032.465s">You'd</a> rather be dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3033.766s">And</a> I'm speaking from experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3035.908s">So</a> we have to do something as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3040.012s">We</a> have to actually get out there and fund some programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3043.855s">Because</a> like I said, when the substance abuse users are ready, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3049.127s">We</a> have to be there to meet them with open arms and give them guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3051.889s">Right</a> now, the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, the 12th step is giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3056.251s">It's</a> giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3057.652s">I'm</a> working with other people, other people that are alcoholics, to try to give them hope, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3067.158s">And</a> I just hope, I just hope that the city administration takes a long look at this and look that since 2003, 2003, in this community, people were overdosing, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3078.84s">on</a> heroin, overdosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3081.101s">A</a> baseball player for the Florida Marlins overdosed within the seven and a half miles of this community several times, several times. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3089.266s">And</a> that was in 2000, early 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3091.007s">And</a> here we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3093.709s">So,</a> uh, like I said, let's actually put our money where our mouths are and fund this something. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3102.534s">And</a> I know councilor Dello Russo called me today cause he knows I've been on his back about calling a committee of the whole meeting on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3108.807s">And</a> I don't know if you chose the date yet, but I thank you for being very active on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3128.503s">And</a> that's what I hope.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7048.212s">Councilor</a> Penta, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7051.133s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7052.093s">And,</a> uh, I do support the main resolution and then Councilor Knight's, uh, amendment as well as, um, Councilor Penta's. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7060.234s">Yeah,</a> I know we're getting to the point where it's, um, we're getting some time under our belt with this new program, but we still really don't have good data. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7071.836s">As</a> the councilor mentioned, we've been on a snow emergency now for a couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7077.395s">You</a> know, people aren't parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7079.175s">Once</a> the snow's away, we can really look into making major changes to this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7084.956s">But</a> at this point, I don't see anything wrong with revisiting the 15 and 30 minutes free parking or something in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7092.878s">And</a> if they have to do it at the end of the parking, if that's the only way that the system in place will work, then it's something they should look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7102.779s">But</a> I just don't know how you're going to enforce the 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7106.68s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7107.697s">This</a> is what you get paid for here at City Hall to figure it out, and I support the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7112.478s">And</a> make it work for the people.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8218.352s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8220.293s">As</a> we all know, state rep Donato has done a great job delivering for the community here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8225.276s">And</a> once again, he has been appointed a higher position. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8230.799s">It</a> seems like every two years, representative Donato has been moving through the ranks. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8235.301s">So</a> he just <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8237.36s">We've</a> got one more promotion in the ranks of leadership, and for that I want to congratulate him. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8241.683s">And</a> hopefully this will allow him to bring more funding to Medford for all the projects that are so important to the quality of life here in our community.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8314.517s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8315.397s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8316.498s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8317.39s">I</a> think this is something we should also have Bill Timmons get involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8321.693s">This</a> is actually a part of his job he should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8324.596s">So</a> if maybe we could get him there for, um, for this very important meeting, uh, I'd like to make sure he's part of this cause we all know, uh, he can issue fines as well as he's the person that certifies the meters every April. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8338.947s">Uh,</a> so he's a front and center and more importantly, he's had dealings with all these, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8344.984s">companies</a> and licenses, so we want to get some input from him on the way they're doing their business and if he feels that they're a reputable business to continue within the confines of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8358.852s">Thank</a> you for a good council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8360.033s">Councilor</a> Knight.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_7XOxP2SN444/2025-03-21_7XOxP2SN444.html">Medford City Council - February 3, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1730.807s">Councilor</a> Camuso, I'm glad you're feeling well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1732.848s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1733.248s">I'd</a> just like to say I'm glad I came down this evening with 101 temperature, but with the wisecrack that Councilor Penta wanted to say about me being sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1742.813s">So</a> I just wanted to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1744.714s">You</a> weren't sure when I was coming back and all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1748.516s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1750.903s">Yes,</a> there was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1752.163s">We'll</a> put the paper on hold for Councilor Caraviello, but we don't know when Councilor Camuso's coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1758.585s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1761.366s">You're</a> just such a wonderful person. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1765.767s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2062.247s">I</a> don't know about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2064.408s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2065.446s">I'd</a> just like to congratulate the Lieutenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2066.987s">You</a> know, he's not only well respected in our community, like the Chief said, but throughout this whole area, whether it's the NMLAC unit, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office, just very, very well respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2080.256s">And</a> I'm very, very happy to see him moving on, but at the same time, sad because he's such an instrumental part of our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2090.143s">I'd</a> also just like to ask the Chief, I don't want to make it a B paper because this is all about Mike, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2094.633s">But</a> Chief, do you anticipate to fill the void with him? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2098.715s">Because</a> I know we're down to bare bones with patrol officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2102.577s">I</a> want to make sure that there is a corral ladder and that the job is filled.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2531.91s">Yes,</a> what the attorney didn't say is that this is not the Attorney General's office right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2540.098s">This</a> was a decision of the Suffolk Superior Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2543.499s">The</a> 48-page document that Councilor Penta refers to is a ruling of the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2549.44s">So</a> I think we should actually get that ruling first, have our city solicitor go over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2555.322s">And</a> quite honestly, in the press release from the Attorney General's office, it appeared that there might be some conversations going forward that Hallmark Health may be able to work out an arrangement, possibly, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2569.94s">if</a> it's set aside from the three hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2573.442s">So</a> I just think it's very, we have to be very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2577.483s">The</a> Attorney General had made a comment, but her comments were prior to the decision of the Suffolk Superior Court Judge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2584.266s">So</a> if we could get that and send it to our legal counsel to look over, because as Councilor Caraviello stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2590.363s">This</a> is something that's going to have a long-term detrimental effect on our community if that place was to shut down due to a merger not taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2599.628s">And</a> that's jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2600.869s">That's</a> a major piece of land in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2604.591s">So</a> we have to be ahead of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2607.433s">And</a> if Hallmark Health, if Lawrence Memorial has to start negotiations with Beth Israel or someone else, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2614.817s">But</a> we all know that the Leahy <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2616.931s">merged</a> with Winchester most recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2619.192s">So</a> I think we have to worry about Lawrence Memorial Hospital and not so much the Hallmark Health on the South Shore, because the people in Melrose right now aren't concerned about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2629.975s">So</a> we have to urge Hallmark Health to look at any and all avenues to keep a hospital afloat here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2638.017s">And</a> as I said, whether it's Beth Israel, whether it's Tufts Medical Center, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2644.269s">And</a> the Brigham and Women's, as we know, has the affiliation with the South Shore Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2648.291s">The</a> Mass General, which is the other part of Partners, was doing the affiliation out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2653.534s">And</a> in their political structure, the Mass General is sort of the king, has a little bit more at the table, I would say, in the boardroom than the Brigham and Women's does. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2664.659s">So</a> we got to just make sure that Lawrence Memorial Hospital is looked at, excuse me, by Hallmark Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2673.412s">for</a> any and all options that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2676.113s">I</a> think, as a community, we can't just say that we back that merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2680.655s">We</a> have to see what other opportunities there are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2684.557s">So</a> I'd like to get the city solicitor to look at the opinion and then ask Hallmark Health specifically if they have any plans for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2694.26s">Because</a> quite honestly, I'm not concerned about Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2696.881s">I'm</a> not concerned about <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2699.007s">uh,</a> South shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2699.887s">And</a> when you look at the elected officials that supported this merger and some that didn't, it appears it was all upon where programs were going within the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2709.972s">The</a> senators out of Lynn were against the merger because it would have affected the Lynn facility would have got programs that they may not have wanted that would have been moved from Melrose Wakefield and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2721.918s">So</a> I think we have to look at the piece of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and not Hallmark Health as a whole.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3853.104s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3853.444s">If</a> I may, we like to move suspension of the rules before a gentleman that would like to address this honorable body.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4646.019s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4647.4s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4648.581s">And,</a> uh, Steven was also a great personal friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4651.422s">Uh,</a> just a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4653.103s">And,</a> uh, as we all know, his family goes back, uh, 50 years of public service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4657.517s">whether</a> it was his dad, Frank, working for the Sheriff's Department back as a superintendent in the 1980s and the 70s, his mom, Roberta, who still works here part-time and does a fabulous job, his brother, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4670.005s">He's</a> also with the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4673.027s">Just</a> a great, great, great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4675.609s">And</a> Stephen will be sorely missed around the baseball field and just around the community in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4680.813s">Just</a> always had a smile on his face, outstanding personality, and just a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4688.418s">want</a> to send my condolences as well.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4733.585s">If</a> I may, many of us that enjoyed the Park League when we were kids as Councilor Lungo was champion for it for many, many years, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4740.978s">When</a> we were kids, the director, well, I'm a couple years older than Counsel Lungo, but the director when I was a kid growing up was Mr. Salido. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4749.886s">Just</a> a great guy, and then I'd often spend time with him after, later in life, I'd be visiting my dad's grave up at Oak Grove Cemetery, and Mrs. Salido was right across the way in the little island there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4764.339s">And</a> he was always, always up there, as we all know, just a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4768.041s">and</a> another dedicated public servant here in our community that will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4772.522s">Mrs.</a> Irwin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4773.462s">We</a> all know Honorable Justice Irwin that passed away a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4778.683s">Another</a> outstanding family here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4782.124s">Ann</a> Marie Callahan is still here in Medford with her loving husband, Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4786.945s">And</a> just a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4788.545s">And</a> she passed away this past week as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4792.446s">So</a> if we could just keep them in our thoughts and prayers and send them a condolence on behalf of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4797.678s">If</a> we could all stand for a moment of silence for all these people near and dear to Medford.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4914.075s">Councilor</a> Penta, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4916.957s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4918.898s">If</a> I just very briefly on this, I'm actually glad to see this development taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4926.682s">And</a> the reason I say that is we have to make sure that the Medford's neighborhood is protected, but that hospital has always concerned me of a not so good development or facility taking place up there because it's actually in a Medford residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4940.615s">practically</a> more than Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4942.435s">And</a> to echo some of my sentiments from earlier when we were talking about the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and potentially having a vacant piece of property and something not so nice for a neighbourhood to come in, and by speaking with this gentleman for the past six months or so, the developer, in meeting with neighbours, I really believe that they're committed to making sure that this is done in a way that it's respectful of the Medford neighbourhood <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4968.999s">I</a> know Councilor Marks put a paper on before, I believe it was you Councilor Marks, correct me if I'm wrong, to install some sort of a structure up there so it will not be a cut through. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4979.528s">So</a> this council has been proactive on this since it first started, but I also very much respect the development and where they do have to go in front of Malden before coming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4990.638s">It</a> would be similar to us doing a development and the developer goes to Somerville before he has <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4997.433s">has</a> the time to come before the Medford City Council or the Medford Zoning Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5001.035s">So</a> if the zoning and stuff isn't approved over there, then this is going nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5005.077s">And</a> it's basically moot on the Medford portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5008.099s">And</a> just for the viewing public, I know the neighbors were very concerned, and there's a great group of neighbors right up there on Lund Road and that whole surrounding area, that they legally have to be notified of any zoning changes <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5021.793s">even</a> if it's across city lines, if they're within the boundaries of what's called for by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5027.836s">I</a> specifically checked that out during a neighborhood meeting up there with our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5032.159s">So</a> anyone that thinks that the zoning laws don't apply because it's on the other side of the town or city border, that is incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5039.203s">And</a> so we will have a seat at the table at the appropriate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5044.325s">And</a> Council President Dello Russo, I know you've been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5047.726s">very</a> hot as well as I was when I was sitting in your seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5052.929s">So,</a> look forward to upcoming meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5056.151s">And</a> thank you for keeping us abreast and getting the developer at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5058.812s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5626.471s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5631.354s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5632.494s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5633.935s">I</a> dealt with this, with the family that the tower's in front of, and this was several years ago when they bought the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5642.439s">They</a> moved out here from the north end of Boston to <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5646.426s">held</a> circle in particular, and I don't believe that's a regular cell tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5652.548s">I</a> think it may have something to do with mass port communications in Logan Airport, but certainly that has been there for the last 20 or 30 years from when we originally looked into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5664.011s">So</a> I agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn to at least get an update, but unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5670.027s">It</a> was something that's been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5671.167s">I</a> think it might have been there prior to the development of some of the houses up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5674.249s">Because</a> I know there would have been huge public outcry at the time to put that inside a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5682.312s">We</a> dealt with it with some of the billboards getting switched out down on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5690.735s">And</a> that's stuff that you have to be cognizant of the fact when you buy your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5694.256s">And</a> I actually said that to the person in the family that I was dealing with at the time that moved out here from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5700.445s">You</a> can't buy your house next to a park and then say, hey, get rid of the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5704.807s">I</a> know I used to have that argument with my grandmother at Century Street all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5707.568s">Now</a> my cousin Joey loves having the park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5711.689s">So</a> if we could get those answers, though, it would at least alleviate some of the questions and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5716.531s">And</a> there's no reason, like Councilor Lungo-Koehn said, the building department should be issuing permits for when they're doing work on it, no matter who it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5722.953s">And</a> there also should be emergency contact information on the fence that goes around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5726.694s">Similar</a> to the National Grid, you drive through Burlington, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5728.978s">And</a> they have those huge towers that are delivering electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5733.2s">And</a> they all say, in case of emergency, call this phone number, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5737.463s">That's</a> important for after-hours emergencies and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5741.164s">So</a> I support this 100%.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5781.946s">If</a> I remember correctly, that was what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5785.323s">One</a> person was the owner, and maybe Massport had some equipment on it, and Verizon, and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5789.906s">So</a> that's a good question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7989.38s">Next</a> in queue is Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7991.562s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7992.863s">And</a> before we go any further, I think we have to urge the mayor that from now on, on Tuesday nights, at least until April, to turn the heat on in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8003.552s">Because</a> I was afraid that it was because I'm under the weather, but I've talked to several people in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8010.077s">It's</a> absolutely freezing in here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8011.918s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn tells me it's 63 degrees in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8014.3s">So</a> next week, we're going to have to bring our scarves and our winter hat to do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8019.372s">But</a> with that being said, two things that I'd be interested to get an update on the current situation is one, a usage report they gave us a few weeks ago, which was good data, told us people seem to be participating within the confines of the laws and restrictions that are put in place by the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8039.865s">And</a> the second thing is I'd like to get an update, Chief, on the tokens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8044.228s">Jimmy's</a> Pizza here, great in the community, as he says. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8048.377s">People</a> come in, they have to wait because he has a line out the door because he's given a good product. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8052.14s">And</a> people go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8055.022s">Look</a> at all the names on the petitions he gives us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8057.384s">Every</a> single one of those people have been in there buying a sandwich. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8060.647s">So</a> keep up the good work, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8063.67s">With</a> that being said, though, I would like to have the tokens in place where Jimmy, as a businessman, could purchase the tokens instead of a quarter, $0.15 maybe for the tokens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8075.079s">And</a> these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8077.264s">Um,</a> I know you're working on it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8096.908s">And</a> it was a very doable plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8098.788s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8099.248s">And</a> with that being said, um, that was my next question was, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8103.07s">if</a> and when this will be instituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8105.471s">Because</a> Jimmy right now, it would be a good tool for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8108.172s">Like</a> he said, it's embarrassing to say to someone, I'll give you a quarter so you can go pay the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8113.553s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8114.313s">When</a> the guy does come into Jimmy's shop or any other shop in the community and they say, hey, you're a good customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8119.315s">Next</a> time you come in here, the pocket's on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8121.296s">And</a> you give them one of these tokens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8124.296s">I</a> mean, that goes far. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8127.017s">Many</a> businesses in this community I know are very, very much for that, whether it's a local barbershop, whether it's some of our bigger restaurants.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8185.714s">Some</a> of these machines have been acting up to, to the point where it's been very customer friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8190.017s">You</a> throw in a quarter, and you get two quarters back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8192.997s">It,</a> uh, it happened to me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8194.978s">And,</a> uh, I know you put it right back though. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8197.159s">Yes,</a> of course I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8198.0s">I</a> put the quarter right back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8200.021s">I</a> drove to the, I drove to the office in South Medford and I gave it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8205.624s">Um,</a> no, but, uh, um, I've been hearing that too, that some of them have been actually spitting quarters back out to the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8214.308s">Somebody,</a> um, somebody sent me an email joke and said, yeah, it's, it's probably wind casino that owns the, owns the things they're trying to get people in their casino. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8222.58s">But</a> with that being said, I'd just like to get an update on the tokens, because as Councilor Caraviello, we're all aware that they are coming, and they said it can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8231.806s">But</a> deciding to do it and putting it into effect are two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8235.809s">And</a> quite honestly, I think right now, this is a slow time of year anyway for all the businesses, especially restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8241.673s">Right</a> after Christmas, January, February, March, every restaurant I've talked to said this is typically their slow season. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8247.037s">I</a> think these would come in more handy now than in <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8250.694s">the</a> end of the year, next year, November, when it's traditional busy time of year, Christmas season. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8255.942s">So</a> if we could just get an update on those two, the usage report, and when I say usage report, the same data that you provided us a few weeks ago with the amount of people that use the machine as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8266.613s">tickets</a> that were issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8267.954s">And</a> last but not least on the tokens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8269.835s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8270.615s">Thanks</a> chief.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8733.283s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8738.886s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8739.987s">For</a> those of the individuals that don't know, Father Kevin Toomey recently got notified of his reassignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8746.972s">And</a> this is a major, major blow to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8749.473s">Raphael's</a> Parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8750.794s">St.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8751.014s">Raphael's</a> is a great parish community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8754.196s">Father</a> Toomey has done an exemplary job down there, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8760.02s">He's</a> been there for <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8762.253s">15</a> or so years, and he is solely responsible for getting people to pledge support financially to build the new Paris Center, which cost around $6 million, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8773.943s">And</a> for that, the community and the parish is grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8777.105s">And</a> we want to wish him well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8778.385s">And</a> I think it's more than appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8780.366s">He's</a> around until June, until he goes to his new assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8783.888s">But</a> I think we should get him down here just to acknowledge him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8786.87s">He</a> was a stalwart supporter of putting up the crossing signs and the lights in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8793.053s">Raphael's</a> Parish for the children of the community, and just was always there for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8798.495s">And</a> I'm going to miss him, not only as my parish <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8802.02s">Pastor,</a> but more importantly, as a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8805.101s">So</a> if we can get him down here at a meeting to receive a congratulation note from the Medford City Council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9102.062s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9102.943s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9104.144s">I</a> would be remiss if I didn't congratulate Uncle Bob, as people often refer to him as. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9111.47s">Him</a> and his wife Cheryl are the proud grandparents of Willow Skye. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9115.914s">And</a> Willow Skye now has the proud parents, Dr. Marty Marin and beautiful Alexandra Mayako Marin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9124.099s">The</a> baby was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9126.961s">And</a> baby and mom are doing great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9128.522s">They</a> just came home a few days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9130.723s">And</a> I just want to congratulate them.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9133.445s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9134.186s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9134.346s">So</a> congratulations to Mr. President, his wife, and the entire family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9138.428s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9376.275s">Yes,</a> I know we did laugh about it a little earlier regarding the climate control in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9382.078s">I</a> wouldn't expect any secretary, any public employee in this building or school or any municipal building <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9387.363s">to</a> work in the temperatures that we've worked in the last two, a couple of council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9393.666s">This</a> is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9395.187s">If</a> there's a problem with the system in this room, then the mayor and or his designee can get it taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9401.371s">In</a> the summertime, it's stifling in here and it's freezing in here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9406.113s">I</a> think no one can argue with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9407.434s">We</a> have people that actually left the meeting because of the temperature in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9411.016s">It's...</a> And you're ailing, but my feet are numb.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9456.526s">And</a> just to follow up, a few weeks ago, Alicia Hunt was in here adjusting the temperature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9463.391s">And</a> I believe they had it set to go off at like 9 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9466.033s">I</a> don't remember a city council meeting in the history of the city of Medford for the past 30 years that hasn't <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9471.995s">gone</a> till nine o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9473.696s">So,</a> uh, has gone, you know what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9476.877s">Has</a> gone, um, less than nine o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9479.938s">It</a> was about a, uh, six month range where some of the meetings were shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9484.219s">Um,</a> but that was due just to the smaller agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9488.18s">This</a> is, uh, this is absurd.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9499.004s">I</a> say we don't, we, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9501.0s">We</a> shouldn't be meeting in this temperature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9502.3s">If</a> it's again like this, really, we should postpone the meeting.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c/2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c.html">Medford City Council - January 20, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=576.924s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=578.265s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Cavill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=579.746s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=580.707s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=582.742s">You</a> make a motion for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=584.964s">I'd</a> like to make a motion for approval on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=587.245s">This</a> is a long overdue thing in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=589.827s">We're</a> proud to have many nursing facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=592.089s">But</a> one thing that I like to see as an elected official is give people the opportunity to participate in programs and still maintain ownership and residence in their own homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=602.916s">And</a> this is going to be another particular case for Medford residents to be able to do that, similar to the Buddy Coholan Center that we have for people with Alzheimer's and dementia. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=612.629s">as</a> well as some other smaller establishments in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=617.291s">But</a> I think this will be a great addition to the South Medford neighbourhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=620.932s">And</a> this will also spur some economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=623.553s">If</a> you have, say, 30 clients and you have to feed 30 people, they're going to be doing grocery shopping in the area or utilising local businesses, whether it may be for prescriptions or first aid stuff or things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=636.377s">So</a> I see this as a win-win to keep a building from being vacant in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=641.192s">And</a> I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2200.261s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2202.682s">I</a> think it, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2205.201s">The</a> gentleman said it a little bit differently than I stated it earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2210.442s">All</a> the votes in motions that were put before this Medford City Council, that were put before this Medford City Council, were unanimous votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2219.625s">Now</a> I understand what the council is talking about, the final vote that we asked for to come back to this council, but the mayor, under his authority, didn't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2230.587s">But</a> we are unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2232.669s">We</a> were unanimous on the two votes that were taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2234.81s">And</a> the two that this council took were one given the mayor the authority, which was a seven to zero vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2241.916s">And</a> then the other vote was the night of the RFP or RFQ. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2246.359s">I</a> forget exactly what it was, but we went over the language of the contract for a couple hours over here back, and I believe it was March of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2255.706s">And</a> it was a seven zero vote to report it out of committee.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2499.849s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2502.391s">So</a> I just have one question for the councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2505.373s">So</a> the <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2506.874s">request</a> for proposal that originally went out that you voted on, you didn't know what was in that contract when you took that vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2515.738s">We</a> had a vote back in March, I think it was March, when we sat at the committee of the whole and went over the request for proposal before Louise Miller put it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2525.023s">Before</a> she put it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2526.724s">The</a> records... Mr. Dello Russo, I'm council president. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2529.885s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2530.445s">I</a> think you made a very good solution before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2533.747s">The</a> city clerk is the official record keeper of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2537.514s">Please</a> give us the votes, Mr. Clerk, on the meeting for the request for proposal that originally went out, and then for giving the mayor the 10 years authority.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2564.093s">That</a> never, ever took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2565.834s">There's</a> two different meetings that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2568.234s">The</a> council is trying to make it look, because he wants to make it look like he took one vote this way, that way, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2573.835s">No</a> he didn't, I'm not taking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2574.956s">There</a> was a seven to nothing vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2578.183s">to</a> send out the request for proposal to the vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2582.687s">Yeah,</a> I'm not arguing with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2584.429s">But</a> if you now want to change the whole program, I'm not saying that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2598.362s">Councilman,</a> you knew it was in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2599.844s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2600.384s">I</a> didn't know it was in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2601.445s">Neither</a> did you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2606.231s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2606.351s">Yes,</a> you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2607.092s">The</a> request for proposal went out back in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2609.555s">So</a> like I said, you know something, Councilman? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2611.096s">That's</a> a request for proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2611.977s">That's</a> not the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2612.618s">With</a> all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2613.639s">With</a> all due respect, I've been watching this for longer than before I was on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2618.402s">You</a> fought something, then you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2619.883s">You</a> just like to make steam. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2621.384s">You</a> never let the truth get in the way of a good story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2623.426s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2624.406s">The</a> only one making steam right now is you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2696.42s">I'd</a> like to get the, I'd like for the clerk for once and for all, because I know for a fact Councilor Penta has given misinformation out there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2706.183s">I</a> would like to allow the clerk to give clarification on the two votes that the Medford city council took. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2710.764s">I</a> would like to do that right now, and then we can put this to sleep, and you won't have to deal with counsel.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2736.602s">I</a> don't want to use the word duped. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2741.804s">The</a> contract called that we put our vote behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2748.886s">But</a> at this point to say that we were totally against it and this and that <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2754.428s">up</a> until the final plan that the mayor would... Who's saying that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2756.869s">Nobody's</a> saying that, Paul.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2760.612s">Either</a> you're for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2761.492s">I'm</a> not talking about your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2763.253s">For</a> or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2764.494s">Councilor,</a> it's so convoluted, what you're trying to do... And your mind is convoluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2768.716s">What</a> you're trying to do here is... And your mind is convoluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2770.597s">Councilor...</a> I go by fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2772.638s">Mr.</a> President, I go by fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2774.94s">I'd</a> just like to see the records of the original votes and... <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2779.657s">where</a> it took us to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2781.177s">Because</a> there is, Councilor Caraviello, in conversations with him, has been approached by what, four or five people? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2787.139s">At</a> least through this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2788.599s">I</a> know someone that was sitting next to the councilor when he's saying that you can blame certain councilors for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2793.6s">Let's,</a> let's- Well, bring that person forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2795.78s">Councilor,</a> they don't like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2796.66s">They</a> don't even want to talk to you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2881.582s">But</a> not in the final plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2882.542s">I</a> see what you're saying.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3842.959s">No,</a> I just, um, I wanted to concur with, I think Dr. Stirella had a fair assessment of the entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3851.582s">If</a> for any, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3852.758s">At</a> any point during this, if we felt we didn't like what was in that request for proposal, four members of the city council could have voted not to give the mayor the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3863.823s">At</a> that point, the process would have stopped, like Councilor Mark said, until he'd come back with something that was palatable that would then give him the authority to go out for the 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3875.388s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3876.328s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3928.916s">Yes,</a> Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3930.136s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3930.496s">My</a> apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3931.417s">And</a> as I was stating, and Councilor Marks was 100% correct, this whole <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3939.897s">All</a> the internal language of the final document was the mayor and the mayor only. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3946.259s">We</a> had several recommendations getting us up to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3948.58s">I,</a> for one, wanted regular meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3951.041s">You</a> put a quarter in and that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3952.522s">This</a> council supported that unanimously way back when at one of the early on meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3957.564s">So</a> Councilor Marks is correct when he says that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3960.985s">But</a> my point is, I just want everyone to know that, and I'm trying to say this the right way so that Councilor Marks <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3966.584s">because</a> I understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3967.625s">People</a> are getting confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3968.985s">And</a> as the young lady from West Medford stated, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3971.147s">Blackburn,</a> I don't know if she left, but as she stated, everyone is saying it's the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3976.41s">And</a> then when certain members of the council are just trying to throw this off on other people and this and that, all the votes that were taken by this council, all the votes that were actually taken by the call of the yeas and nays regarding parking has been unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3990.859s">Now,</a> once the final,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4005.537s">Like</a> I said, Mr. President, Councilor Penta can say whatever he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4009.08s">He</a> can backpedal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4010.402s">But</a> the bottom line is, we saw the request for proposal early in 2014, as Dr. Stirella stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4018.289s">We</a> gave the mayor the authority, knowing what was in that written proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4022.385s">So</a> you know what, if we feel like maybe we made a mistake doing it, then let's say that we made a mistake and it's something different than we thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4030.678s">But</a> to throw the red herring out that three members of this council, or four members, or five members, or six members of this council voted one way and other members didn't, it was unanimous, all the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4041.822s">And</a> the city clerk's gonna give it to us next week because I asked for that in the form of a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4046.744s">So</a> once it's apples to apples, I may take out a full page ad in the Medford transcript so that the people can see that Councilor Penta is not being forthcoming and truthful 100% on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4088.236s">And</a> was there?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4094.179s">He</a> can say it any way he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4098.101s">And</a> as I stated, Mr. President, when the councillor wants to do coffee talk banter and blame certain members of this council, the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4107.826s">You're</a> running around the town telling.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4123.394s">Thank</a> you, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4125.015s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4125.415s">Let</a> the people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4126.255s">If</a> I could just finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4127.035s">I'm</a> going to wrap up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4127.856s">Councilor</a> Camuso is going to wrap up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4130.196s">I'm</a> going to wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4131.777s">But</a> when I have people that are telling me, when Councilor Caraviello is having people tell him directly, four or five people, and other councillors are hearing the same stuff, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4143.24s">All</a> these different groups are not making it up that this is what's being said out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4147.683s">So</a> I just want the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4149.024s">The</a> truth will set everybody free. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4151.186s">The</a> truth will set us free. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4152.607s">So</a> the clerk next week will come back with the documents, and then we'll see in the local newspaper, come election time, if Councilor Penta's words come back to bite him.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5141.607s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5143.168s">Thank</a> you to the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5144.809s">Hey,</a> chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5147.911s">I</a> think, uh, I think one thing that I think we could look at, um, doing pretty quick and it's similar to what councilor Marks and councilor Lungo said, I'm not so sure the contract, if there's even room for negotiation for total 15 minutes or 30 minutes free, I would love to see it, but realistically, I'm not so sure the contract, that's something we'd be able to achieve through negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5171.145s">I</a> think we might be able to achieve something, though, where from the time of your expiration, you don't actually get a written ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5178.808s">You</a> give a 10-minute leeway at the end of it before you get that violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5183.571s">So</a> similar to a speeding ticket, when you're out tagging and it's 25 miles an hour, I'm not going to say it out loud, but there's a traditional formula they use. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5193.675s">If</a> you go above certain thing over, you know what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5196.997s">With</a> that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5199.056s">I</a> think that's something that could give some instant relief and help out, even if we do it for six months, just a 10 minute at the end of the, when it's about to expire. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5211.444s">So</a> if your thing expires 125, Republic doesn't write a ticket until 136. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5216.106s">So</a> you get a 10 minute leeway at the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5220.249s">We're</a> still going to be turning over the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5222.27s">I</a> think that would have a good intent as far as turning over parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5227.362s">not</a> hammering people with tickets, but holding them accountable if they're over the limit by 11, uh, 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5233.727s">And</a> then once they hit that, um, next one, is that something that Republic, I mean, and not talking about contractual, but I think that's something that would make more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5242.994s">And</a> listen, I have to preface it by, I think all of us here would love to see the first 15 minutes of the 30 minutes free, but there's really going to be no way to police that because it's actually, when you're putting the money in the kiosk, that's, what's actually initiating <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5255.716s">with</a> all the data and the information technology that you got there at 1 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5260.097s">So</a> they're not going to know when the 15 minutes started, when it didn't start. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5263.657s">You</a> know what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5264.277s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5266.218s">That's</a> just the way information technology works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5270.378s">But</a> on the other end, that's something fairly easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5272.579s">That's</a> just a training piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5274.739s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that we look for a 10-minute grace period at the end of each thing before a violation is given, at least for a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5285.875s">to</a> get people knowledgeable and even, well actually, I was gonna say give those fake ones out like they were given out, not a fake one, but a zero dollar one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5296.078s">But</a> I just think that achieves our goal of turning over spots, but it's also holding people accountable with a little breathing room. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5306.722s">So</a> I'd like to make that a motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5325.902s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5327.484s">And</a> to Republic, to follow up on that, has any cities and towns done something like that that you're aware of, where you guys would just instruct your people not to write the violation for the 10 minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5341.975s">Oh,</a> that's not on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5393.859s">So</a> I'd like to make the motion for the 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5396.039s">And</a> I know now we can initiate, well, we want it 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5400.281s">10</a> minutes, I think is reasonable when you <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5402.562s">when</a> you're running in real quick, just to get the ball rolling, the conversation started between the mayor and the company.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5542.826s">So</a> I just, I'll wrap up on this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5544.727s">Um,</a> I'd like to make it so that there's a 10 minute grace period at the end of each expired, um, session.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5874.677s">Yes,</a> it's in our contract though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5876.358s">I</a> believe Councilor Penta, I don't know if he stated it, that they cannot use this information.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5882.32s">They</a> can't.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5883.04s">They</a> won't use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5883.779s">Because</a> no, you just said Mr. Nash, his company in Republic in New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5887.321s">You</a> said someone has their data.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5892.685s">All</a> right, because I misunderstood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5895.106s">I</a> thought you knew something, and I was going to tell you to call the FBI if that was the case, with all the stuff going on in today's day and age.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5905.934s">I'm</a> sorry, Anthony.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6209.785s">Motion</a> to leave this open. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6212.066s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6647.138s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6648.899s">Councilor</a> Knight brought this up in the past too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6652.775s">If</a> something's going to be under suspension, every member of this council should have the courtesy of at least seeing it and signing off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6658.863s">This</a> wasn't under suspension, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6661.126s">No,</a> the other paper that you just handed to him.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6665.212s">I</a> understand the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6670.806s">Did</a> he give you, I thought it was an original, he said it was 15-032.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6692.159s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6692.479s">And</a> that was my point, Mr. President, because when anything goes under suspension for many members of these council, any member of the council, we all see it, we initial it and then give it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6701.925s">It</a> wasn't a suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6702.905s">When</a> it was given a number earlier, one would assume that it was under suspension and that we didn't sign off on it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6717.814s">We've</a> had many resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6718.875s">Like</a> I said, just moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6721.347s">Anything</a> under suspension, I think we should all see.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6726.629s">Amended</a> on the floor, but not given to the city clerk with a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6729.25s">I</a> said, he read my resolution.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7121.628s">Um,</a> this was already brought up earlier as a, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7125.948s">Resolution</a> as an amendment by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7127.969s">It</a> was I said the ticket talking about it stop and shop in the second question following up people that actually get a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7133.911s">Now,</a> these are the people we're getting up in mornings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7135.972s">Will</a> they actually get an envelope to mail it in as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7137.993s">Other</a> communities get an envelope priests pre it's pre addressed.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7156.424s">Other</a> communities do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7157.885s">Where</a> are people going to be mailing them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7158.965s">To</a> a lockbox out of state somewhere? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7160.326s">Or</a> right to Medford Main Street?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7166.529s">I</a> just, I think it's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7168.35s">I</a> think they're.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7177.394s">Yeah,</a> that's true, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7178.074s">Use</a> an orange envelope with a white ticket.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7307.45s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, just in wrapping this up, Chief Sackle, I would be remissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7314.212s">And</a> I think all of us, while we're not, we're not thoroughly happy the way things are been rolled out, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7322.65s">But</a> there's been one person that is a city employee that has been doing a great job with this, and that's the gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7331.694s">I've</a> met him on several occasions over the past two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7335.636s">He</a> actually got in his vehicle, come out, met this man right here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7340.297s">And</a> I can appreciate when we say that we want him doing chief of police business, but for taking on the additional responsibility, Chief, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7349.336s">We</a> couldn't have had a better person in this city doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7351.278s">Your</a> personality, your knowledge of the law, and just being responsive to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7358.665s">For</a> our police chief, and this came up earlier in the meeting, and I wasn't going to let him go home tonight without bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7369.595s">Last</a> week, this man personally went down <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7373.157s">Did</a> you pay the meter, though, when you went to every square?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7375.558s">Every</a> square.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7377.658s">Every</a> square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7378.919s">The</a> chief went to every single square that have these kiosks, walked around all the businesses, answered questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7386.961s">And</a> he didn't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7389.101s">You</a> know what?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7392.582s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7393.302s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7393.702s">I</a> haven't finished the square, Medford Square, yet.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7396.863s">There</a> is some businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7397.943s">But</a> like I said, I just. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7400.214s">You</a> know what, he's been the point person, and we couldn't have a better department head doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7404.196s">And</a> thank you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7405.316s">And</a> this will all quiet down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7406.817s">As</a> far as the rollout, and it's way above your pay grade, it could have went a little bit more seamless. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7413.979s">I</a> think there could have been a lot of more information getting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7417.561s">But</a> you're doing an outstanding job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7419.882s">And</a> I'm speaking for all the councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7421.342s">Even</a> Councilor Penter and I, I bet you're in agreement with this 180%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7423.623s">Right,</a> Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7423.963s">Hooray.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7427.15s">He</a> said he don't answer.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9610.629s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9615.356s">Um,</a> I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9618.213s">and</a> I wish we did get notified, but I certainly understand from a homeowner's standpoint that the mayor probably would want to go on vacation and not have you running around the coffee shops yelling that he's out of town and so that someone can probably maybe go to his house and burglarize it because he's on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9635.876s">I</a> mean, it's just, like I said, I just find it quite amusing, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9645.138s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9647.42s">Like</a> I said, I can understand, but... Is that a point of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9651.421s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9652.382s">No,</a> when you go to Florida with your friends, you don't tell people.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9657.964s">Nor</a> should you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk/2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk.html">Medford City Council - January 13, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=57.543s">I'd</a> like suspension of rule number 33 to take item 15-012.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=95.566s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=97.007s">As</a> we're all aware, the city has several accounts, the overlay surplus account, the linkage account, water and sewer enterprise, certified free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=106.773s">I</a> think it's about time that this city council asked the mayor to have an actual account in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=115.287s">for</a> long-term stabilization of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=118.189s">You</a> know, the mayor's not going to be here forever, and we want to make sure that there is a stabilization fund in place so that in years to come, this city can be financially stabilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=134.439s">In</a> the past, I know Budget Director Burke, as a member of this council, often called for a capital improvement fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=141.418s">And</a> I just think this is a good way where, come budget time, we could actually ask the mayor, hey, we would like to see X amount of dollars put into this actual account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=151.606s">And</a> I just think it's something that we have to do to think about the future of our children, that someday we'll be the leaders in this community, and to make sure that we set it up in a way that will be financially stable for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=166.918s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=169.556s">on</a> setting up an actual municipal city account for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=173.979s">On</a> the motion of approval by Councilor Camuso, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=289.281s">I</a> can understand where you're coming from, and I do not oppose it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=293.322s">The</a> intent of this at this point is to open the line item account so that it's an actual line item come budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=299.144s">And</a> then at that point, I think that would be the appropriate opportunity as we're going through the budget line by line to say, as a council, we'd like to see X amount put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=309.009s">As</a> we know, there's many accounts throughout the city budget right now that are funded for $1. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=313.111s">But</a> if you want to put a dollar amount, amend the paper to put a dollar amount in there, I would support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=319.574s">But</a> ultimately, if the mayor decides that he's not for that dollar amount, I think we have to be reasonable here and first set up the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=327.458s">And</a> moving forward, fund it in a manner that will stabilize our community for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=332.581s">So</a> if you want to put a dollar amount, I'll support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=335.042s">But</a> if he doesn't agree with that, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=337.605s">I</a> just would hate to have him say that this is the end of it, and at least a small dollar amount to get the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=344.248s">Because</a> if we do this every year, or if he appropriates the money throughout the year, too, at the end of the year, oftentimes, we're transferring money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=353.513s">I</a> would like to see it going to a stabilization fund rather than the free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=358.555s">Because</a> ultimately, big projects like the police station are going to be bonded. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=362.537s">And</a> if we can have money in an account for that specific purpose, and I have to be clear, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=367.437s">This</a> is not for the new police station and the new police station only. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=371.099s">This</a> is for the stabilization of our community for major projects like the police station, like other things that may come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=377.123s">So</a> I just don't want to be misleading to the community like you had mentioned, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=381.126s">So</a> if you want to put a dollar amount, I'll support it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=460.543s">Well,</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=461.924s">Uh,</a> it's my motion at this point, I'll even strike out the police station, uh, wording and just set up the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=468.37s">It</a> takes four votes of the council to set up the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=471.434s">And</a> I think we have to just set up the account with the intent of big projects like the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=475.615s">Because</a> you're right, council, I don't want to pit group against group and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=480.637s">In</a> order for the mayor to utilize the money, he's going to need the votes of this council anyway at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=485.439s">So</a> if I can, Mr. President, strike out the word such as the police station in the near future and just set up for any major projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=495.462s">And</a> if you want to put a dollar amount, go ahead.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=577.704s">This</a> would be an account, a line item in the budget, a municipal account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=582.768s">set</a> up by the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=585.51s">And</a> going forward, naturally, if the mayor wanted to put any money from any of those other accounts into this account, he'd have to get votes of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=592.774s">So</a> I'd be happy with it, setting the account up with the $1 amount and working with the mayor throughout the calendar year and years to come to fund it as we see fit.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=723.247s">That</a> was not the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=724.889s">We</a> can't tax any more until next December anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=727.31s">So</a> I just want to be loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=728.911s">This</a> is not to raise taxes or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=731.973s">It's</a> taking the existing funds or and or come budget time to put funds in it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1107.255s">If</a> I can, I agree with Councilor Penta totally. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1114.378s">Which</a> cleanup? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1115.238s">Making</a> it an amendment or do you want to add your name to the original paper and we can do whatever you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1121.319s">I</a> know the two part prong approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1123.3s">Establish</a> the account and then do what Councilor Lungo and Councilor Marks said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1127.041s">After</a> the dollar account is established, it's just a line item in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1130.121s">It</a> may not be funded for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1131.902s">We</a> have things that are funded.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1183.69s">Mr.</a> President, I agree with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1188.292s">I</a> support your amendment wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1190.253s">I'd</a> like to establish this and then send this to the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1194.365s">for</a> discussion to fund it in the future, prior to the budget this year, but as far as getting the, this council has to be proactive by getting that account set up, even if he does it, he may tell us no, he's not doing it, but at least get the account set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1206.994s">There's</a> no harm in doing that, as Councilor Pence has stated, and I thank you for meeting me halfway, Councilor Penter, on this.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1424.078s">It's</a> a stabilization fund for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1427.059s">I</a> put the police station in, but you were brought up a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1429.52s">The</a> library needed this 1.2 for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1432.301s">So</a> just set up the account as a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1436.643s">And</a> then the committee of the whole sort of keep it simple at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1917.633s">As</a> amended by Councilor Pence.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3524.259s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3530.303s">On</a> this particular matter, I know it's, I want to choose my words carefully here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3538.48s">If</a> the council wants to expand the program to bakeries and sub shops and other businesses, then bring the motion forward and I'm sure that people will support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3549.464s">But</a> just to start talking about this business, that business and stuff, I just think it's unfair because if you want to expand the program, bring it forward if you think there's some inequities out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3562.628s">But</a> just to throw generalities out there, no one knows what you're talking about.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3759.281s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3759.521s">A</a> couple of questions for the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3760.802s">And</a> then, uh, I actually have a statement I want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3763.063s">We</a> got in this pocket program, but first, um, the outcome of the handicap parking, did you get to the bottom of that?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3807.691s">Um,</a> just to follow up, um, this was something that, uh, today I, I saw a child almost get hit by a vehicle today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3815.627s">at</a> the corner of Playstead Road and High Street, there's a vehicle that parks there every day with a handicapped plate in an illegal spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3822.992s">It's</a> painted yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3824.794s">It's</a> painted yellow as clear as day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3828.136s">And</a> it's between two crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3830.798s">If</a> I've ever seen a dangerous situation, that child came right out, and it was after the crossing guards were gone this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3838.543s">That</a> vehicle should not be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3840.285s">And</a> I've often said it as I was driving by, I'm just surprised that it doesn't get tagged, doesn't get tagged, doesn't get tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3845.529s">But</a> today there was almost an awful accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3849.312s">I</a> think you have to do something about that vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3851.914s">They</a> have a legitimate handicapped sticker, then park it legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3857.659s">Don't</a> park it illegally where someone's going to get injured because you're blocking the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3862.763s">That</a> is unacceptable as far as I'm concerned, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3865.345s">And</a> I think you have to deal with that situation because it's every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3868.308s">It's</a> every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3869.929s">And</a> I almost saw a kid get hit today and I would have felt horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3873.983s">If</a> someone got hurt, and I didn't bring this to your attention earlier, but today it stuck out like a sore thumb.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3902.617s">Listen,</a> I don't care who parks there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3904.678s">You</a> could be someone that I disagree in the community with 180%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3906.778s">If</a> you're going to park illegally, and it's blatant disregard for two crosswalks, someone with a handicap sticker should understand and not park between a crosswalk where elderly and senior citizens and other handicapped people use. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3927.281s">retaliation</a> for the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3929.422s">This</a> is America. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3930.622s">Anyone</a> can speak up for or against any issue, but don't think you're untouchable because you may just, uh, you may just, uh, it's not, it's believe me, the police department is not treating them as untouchable.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3943.547s">No,</a> I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3944.368s">But,</a> and like I said, this was, and I have to preface this, many people have brought that vehicle to my attention before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3951.815s">And</a> you know, you drive by and you see it, it's really not bothering anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3956.097s">But</a> when a car came around from high street, taking the right on Playstead Road, and it was a child, and the child actually popped his head back, would you be in agreement that it's a major safety issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3969.863s">Oh,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3971.544s">And</a> as well, I've talked to other people that have drove engine two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3976.266s">That</a> vehicle actually, and this was years ago when it was a different car that was parking there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3979.507s">I'm</a> not even sure if it's the same owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3981.049s">But</a> Engine 2 sometimes has to make that swing when they're coming down High Street and making the swing to go down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3989.517s">And</a> it's gotten the way before they've actually had to do a three-point turn on the way to an emergency call. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3996.083s">And</a> last but not least, on that particular matter, the person can legally park in front of their store, from what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4005.612s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4007.02s">Take</a> a spot in front of your store that a customer may park in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4009.642s">Legally,</a> you don't have to pay the meter like everyone else, because you have a legitimate handicap placket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4015.988s">But</a> park it in a safe manner, as far as I'm concerned.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4031.38s">It's</a> not about- please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4034.023s">Mr.</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4036.098s">Another</a> thing that's come to my attention with this park, and we have to set the record straight on this, a senior member of the mayor's office that lives in this community, one of his longest serving members in that office, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4049.16s">has</a> been putting statements on social media outlets that the reason this pocket is in place is because the Medford City Council didn't support a garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4060.803s">I</a> want to make it loud and loud and loud and clear that the mayor of this community never brought a proposal to the Medford City Council for a garage because he did not have the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4073.526s">And</a> if we remember, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4075.848s">I,</a> as one member of this council, urged him, urged him to take it to the council, take a vote up or down, and move forward on the issue, just like the Brooks estates and other issues that were before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4088.157s">I</a> think it was pretty common knowledge that four members of the city council at the time were for a garage, three members of the council were against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4094.282s">But</a> to throw the red herring out there that the Medford City Council is a direct result for this, that is not only a- Point of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4189.448s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4191.29s">Just</a> to be very clear, this council, the paper was before us for the parking program, and I'm not backpedaling at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4199.725s">seven</a> members of this council saw the request for proposal, seven members of this council knew what it was going to consist of, the meter slash kiosk, but for someone in the administrative wing of this building to blatantly throw that out there, that that's the result, just because they're probably filled in hundreds and hundreds of calls per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4218.939s">It's</a> just outright wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4221.621s">Put</a> the facts out there, that the mayor didn't bring that garage to this council because he knew he didn't have the votes at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4226.785s">And</a> I'll quite honestly tell you, I made my stance known at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4230.168s">I</a> was for the garage, and I was upset that he did not bring it forward and just put it behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4235.552s">Take</a> the vote, move on to the next issue, like we're supposed to do in the democratic process.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5079.761s">Built</a> to grow after the program's already established. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5083.002s">The</a> point of information I have is some of these ones, they're not in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5089.082s">a</a> major square, as long as the time limit is enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5096.145s">The</a> whole purpose of this is to keep the turnover so that if there's a bunch of stores together, it's not just one business that's getting all the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5104.548s">It's</a> for the turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5105.288s">That's</a> what we heard loud and clear, at least from the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5108.009s">If</a> it's like Joe's Pizza, I don't want to use names, but down in the Arlington line, if they're parking cars out there all day, it's only affecting Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5118.275s">That</a> one establishment, if you go down to Haines Square or West Medford or Medford Square, and you park a car out there all day, you're having a residual effect on all the businesses that can't have their customers parked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5129.739s">So</a> I think the rationale was to do the major ones first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5132.0s">Is</a> that correct for that reason?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5134.461s">Because</a> it was the turnover thing that the Chamber of Commerce was looking for.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6728.078s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6728.918s">Counsel</a> Kamosa. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6730.819s">Um,</a> is it actually waived or was there an arrangement made with the city that the city would pick up that portion or was it just, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6738.791s">In</a> good faith, wave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6740.351s">It's</a> gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6741.092s">No</a> one's picking it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6741.812s">No</a> one's paying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6742.472s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6742.752s">So</a> it wasn't in lieu of the fee now that the citizens don't see the city's paying it on some other end.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6757.417s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6757.677s">But</a> to be very clear, people that are using Park Mobile still will pay the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6762.42s">Yeah,</a> that's, that's a third party. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6763.581s">You</a> just have to spell that out because people will be coming back here saying I got a fee and this and that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6772.928s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6773.589s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6773.989s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6774.91s">You're</a> all set.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6776.111s">Councilor</a> Camuso and then the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6778.432s">Real</a> quick to the chief of police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6780.694s">Um,</a> just two, two things on within the squares, uh, West side preschool in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6786.639s">Can</a> you put that on the traffic commission to get drop off slash pickup for the business please at the next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6792.874s">They're</a> dealing with the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6795.414s">High</a> street people getting dropped off, picked up.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6805.076s">And</a> then, last but not least, the T bus stops throughout the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6809.357s">I</a> think this would be the appropriate time to look at moving some of them outside of the squares, maybe, just a little bit, to free up additional spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6819.539s">Can</a> you, rather than making it <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6821.803s">The</a> City Council bringing recommendations forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6823.824s">I</a> know that in the past, there's a restaurant establishment in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6827.646s">This</a> may be the time where you look at things like that so that it frees up additional parking, like the liquor store in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6835.671s">There's</a> a bus stop there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6838.452s">Would</a> it make more sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6839.973s">I'm</a> not familiar with that gentleman over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6843.135s">He's</a> acting strange, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6845.076s">I</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6846.897s">Oh,</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6847.877s">We'll</a> observe proper decorum in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6850.359s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6851.332s">It's</a> kind of just a little odd when I was looking at the Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6854.655s">So</a> anyway, Chief, as I was saying, the bus stops though, to free up additional spaces for the businesses slash consumers, I think maybe just look at it as we're doing this program to see if it makes sense to move any of them to give additional spots in certain areas.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6905.039s">And</a> then that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6907.38s">There</a> are businesses throughout the community that are within the districts that have bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6912.264s">And</a> that's the reason why they don't have a kiosk because <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6915.267s">of</a> the bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6916.448s">And</a> I think people have to be cognizant of that, because people have been saying, well, why isn't this business? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6920.39s">That's</a> why you can't get into that game. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6922.651s">But</a> it is, particularly in South Medford, some of the bus stops, the reason the kiosk didn't go in certain areas is because of bus stops and limited parking as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6932.897s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6934.338s">And</a> Westside Preschool, if you can put that on there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8695.728s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8697.789s">And</a> I'm very glad you brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8700.891s">A</a> few minutes ago, we had a young lady at the podium <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8704.493s">and</a> discussing making her street, just the city with the wave of a lawn, make her street resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8710.798s">This</a> is exactly the reason why the city doesn't want to do it without community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8718.184s">This</a> is a perfect example and I feel, excuse me, I definitely understand your concerns and this is why if a certain neighbourhood wants to institute resident parking, the whole neighbourhood's notified <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8735.583s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=8736.323s">And</a> the chief will address your concerns.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9596.538s">Councilor</a> Penta referred to it as a revenue enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9600.461s">Can</a> you just explain that one of years? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9604.238s">You</a> said revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9605.138s">He</a> just called it a revenue enforcement program.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10364.929s">We</a> can't monitor the entire city every two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10367.31s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10370.171s">Contractual</a> question for you, following up on Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10374.033s">Limited</a> to two in the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10377.414s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10387.579s">But</a> who makes the determination whether it's two hours a week? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10392.104s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10392.865s">How</a> many hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10394.827s">92</a> hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10395.448s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10395.788s">But</a> there's the ability to expand that if the needs be.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10406.409s">The</a> reason I, the reason I asked that if your revenues aren't what you like, now you put out 25 people doing tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10412.012s">No,</a> we don't have the ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10413.373s">I</a> want to make sure you don't have the authority to, uh, you can't say, uh, you know what is hopefully people just play by the rules and you guys go bankrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10424.98s">That's</a> what I'm hoping. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10426.281s">But,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10427.947s">Uh,</a> yeah, no, I just want to make sure that, uh, and, and that would be our lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10432.089s">I'd</a> like to ask the question, what the max is to our legal department, because I don't want to see next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10437.531s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10437.791s">We're</a> now buying an extra seven vehicles and there's going to be nine cars out there now, ticket and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10442.132s">At</a> least right now with two cars, it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10444.593s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10445.273s">Right</a> now it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10446.694s">If</a> the car's in Haines square, you might get away with it 20 times in West Medford, but that one time that the car's down in West Medford, you're getting a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10453.036s">So</a> it's not a guarantee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10453.957s">Every</a> time you're taking a gamble, just like when you go to Winchester center, it's a gamble right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10457.992s">You</a> go to Davis Square, it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10459.733s">But</a> with that being said, the more people you put on the road, your odds are getting better that you're going to get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10464.757s">And</a> I want to make sure that this isn't revenue-driven, the decision to put more cars on the road to ticket more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10470.821s">So</a> I'd like to ask that through our legal department. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10472.682s">I</a> think that's very important.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10497.233s">No,</a> officers, because listen, if they want to make revenue, they may just take a 15-passenger van and start dropping these ambassadors in all the squares.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10506.358s">You</a> ever see the Boston Transportation Department? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10508.639s">They</a> show up with a little orange light on the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10510.7s">Next</a> thing you know, there's 15 people jumping out with their little handheld things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10513.521s">And</a> that's not what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10516.773s">I'm</a> concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10517.993s">Let</a> me ask you a question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10569.763s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10571.804s">If,</a> if indeed the mayor, and I have to say up to this point, we have no reason to believe that this is a revenue enhancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10578.626s">We</a> haven't seen it yet, but listen, the mayor is hearing this loud and clear as much as we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10583.488s">I'm</a> sure he doesn't want, he'd rather not have any revenue and have no one getting tickets in his phone, not ringing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10589.589s">So</a> as far as that said, I'd like to make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10592.123s">that</a> the mayor limits this to two, at least for the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10595.506s">They</a> don't even negotiate to put more people on the road until an amendment to the contract or whatever it is until at least a year.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10628.067s">And</a> here's the other one other thing to follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10631.19s">The</a> chief of police still has the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10634.406s">The</a> chief of police still has the authority to give out tickets, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10638.549s">In</a> the off hours, I would rather see police officers given the opportunity to come in on overtime if they decide that they're going to whatever, because it's going to pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10648.137s">And</a> my rationale with that is it puts an additional police officer on the road that can respond to a baby choking, can respond to a bank robbery, can respond to things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10655.703s">A</a> meter ambassador isn't going to be able to respond to 911 calls and things of that nature if there's a serious emergency in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10662.349s">And</a> it's going to pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10664.436s">So</a> I think that that's important too, that the city looks at its own police force to do this on an overtime basis in regards to additional enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10675.024s">Because</a> I'm a firm believer, and I think all this council is, I can't speak for all the council, but I'm a firm believer, the more police officers we have on the street, whether it's a detail, whether it's overtime, whether it's parking enforcement, the city's in better hands because they got their radio on and they can respond to emergency needs as see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10691.778s">So</a> I'd like to make that amendment too.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10859.313s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10861.315s">Is</a> this staggering? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10862.537s">You</a> used the word staggering. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10864.178s">So</a> does that mean the person that will be out there driving around in this vehicle, one of them will come in, say, four in the afternoon, so in the morning will be down to one vehicle, or will it be two and then an additional person at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10874.83s">The</a> word staggering to me is...
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10906.284s">Should</a> we, um, would it be in the best interest of the city to outfit one of our police cruises or maybe small smart car or something, something environmentally friendly that has the same thing, but it's actually a patrol vehicle police.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10924.829s">I</a> think then, and like I said, even if it's on an overtime basis, it's going to pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10929.33s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10929.988s">The</a> police officers, I would rather see, because they're going to use their discretion a lot more than a private company, with all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10936.133s">Private</a> company, there's a violation.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10938.955s">The</a> police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10939.796s">Well,</a> the permit packing is what I'm looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10941.737s">Oh,</a> the permit packing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10942.458s">So</a> the permit packing, either you're registered or you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10944.92s">The</a> police officer running out of Sunnyhurst in Haines Square or the convenience store may give you a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10951.365s">With</a> all due respect.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11242.338s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11243.018s">And</a> I heard Councilor Prentis saying continue this next week for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11249.501s">But</a> let's not discuss the same thing week after week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11255.144s">This</a> is, I think, I'm just making my point known. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11259.135s">There</a> are legitimate concerns out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11260.856s">We</a> want to hear legitimate concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11262.917s">But</a> for people to think that we can just make this program go away, now the mayor signed a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11267.939s">Call</a> the mayor's office, voice your concerns with him if you have an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11272.902s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, this council always is here to hear the citizens of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11277.964s">But</a> week after week after week after week after week, bring the legitimate concerns to the members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11286.088s">We'll</a> be here to meet your needs, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11288.63s">We'll</a> put you in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11290.432s">Call</a> us any day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11291.112s">You</a> don't have to wait for Tuesday night to come down here because I can speak for all the members of my council, colleagues that sit around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11298.319s">We</a> respond to people and we try to get them the solutions that they may not like the solution, but it will at least put them in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11305.886s">So,</a> but I just think at some point we have to stop crying that the program's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11312.372s">We</a> have to look to make the program better. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11314.865s">and</a> less.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11538.105s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11540.226s">First</a> of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11541.468s">I'll</a> call a point of information any time I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11544.489s">You</a> have no status in this community, a fine American once said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11547.81s">A</a> fine American once said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11551.331s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11553.032s">Your</a> point of information, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11554.692s">The</a> votes were unanimous on the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11556.753s">So</a> the gentleman makes up fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11560.354s">The</a> facts of the record don't lie.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12034.462s">I</a> would absolutely love to have him here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12037.528s">The</a> fact of the matter is if we want to actually get answers and not yell and scream to get him here when we know he's not coming, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12046.573s">Listen,</a> the best predictor of the future is the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12049.154s">And</a> for the past 30 years, whether I believe it's right, wrong, or indifferent, the next mayor of this community, I'm sure, will be at this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12055.857s">But</a> for the last 30 years, he has not been. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12058.279s">With</a> that being said, if we really want answers, if we really want to give the citizens an opportunity to ask him questions, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12066.327s">Let's</a> do it where the past the past is the best predictor of the future Those things have been answered and that was in the committee of the whole Now we can come out from that committee of the whole and discuss it here on the floor But if it's anything more than theatrics calling for him to come here He's been here once and it was the methadone clinic once you've been here in the city of Medford as a council longer than him as the mayor and he's been here once Once and why was he here? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12089.455s">Tell</a> us why because the methadone clinic <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12090.995s">And</a> why? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12091.555s">There</a> was 300 people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12092.455s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12092.895s">There</a> was 300 people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12093.636s">And</a> he outspotted all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12094.576s">So</a> on the way in, they're throwing rocks at him. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12096.016s">They</a> were carrying him out on their shoulders. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12097.937s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12098.237s">So</a> learn something from the guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12099.577s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12100.317s">There's</a> 20 years ahead of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12101.778s">Let's</a> have him at the Committee of the Whole and get the answers that are important.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12165.738s">And</a> furthermore, as I stated, people that are out there that have concerns like the mom and pop businesses, loading zones, things of that nature, call any member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12177.672s">There's</a> certain members on this council that called for these kiosks in 09. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12180.234s">We</a> want to get you the answers that are important to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12182.956s">Believe</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12184.117s">So</a> if we can just have the open dialogue and people don't have to wait till Tuesday if they don't want to, because as councilor Caraviello stated the last few weeks, there's ongoing dialogue every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12195.465s">The</a> chief 90% of your day I'm sure is this now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12199.068s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12200.769s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12626.705s">Thank</a> you, and I certainly do support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12630.187s">The</a> evening, I think this came up in discussion recently when I put the name of Robert M. Penta forward for the reappointment to the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12639.294s">It</a> was actually discussed that evening, and Councilor Knight at the time said that a resolution would be forthcoming after the first of the year, and here it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12647.159s">And</a> certainly, I do support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12649.481s">We</a> want the best possible people in all these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12654.502s">I</a> support it and I think it's being very proactive and thank you for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12659.408s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12686.353s">Everyone</a> was vetted and the majority of the council did put the person or people in the leadership positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12693.775s">And</a> same as it's been done always. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12696.735s">And</a> just because you may not have the votes, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12699.298s">Cry</a> over sour grapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12700.579s">And</a> I appreciate the unanimity of the voting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12704.12s">For</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12704.58s">The</a> votes to become the president and the vice president.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12709.662s">So</a> don't tell me I didn't have the votes.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12713.384s">I</a> didn't ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12714.284s">Well,</a> it doesn't matter.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1627.203s">Motion</a> to receive and place on file.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1898.346s">It's</a> on motion of Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1900.168s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1903.651s">I</a> agree with Councilor Penter to the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1906.293s">If</a> people are going to use the name Medford, the city seal or anything of that nature, then the city should be a watchdog. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1914.019s">I</a> think this has to be with websites that are out there, domain names and things of that nature too, because people do maliciously name Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1923.986s">for</a> different entities, including the gentleman that just spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1926.907s">So</a> maybe if we want to look at this, we'll look at anything that contains the name Medford and get ahold of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1932.669s">And</a> I look forward to doing that under Councilor Pinter's recommendation at the subcommittee.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2012.347s">Joe,</a> good luck to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2013.127s">I</a> think there's a lot of people out here that want him on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2015.369s">So</a> good luck to you in your future endeavors, Mr. Viglione. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2020.511s">With</a> all due respect, I'm just referring to what my council colleague said. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2024.354s">Nothing</a> to do with the gentleman at the podium stated, but my council colleague actually said it eloquently, Councilor Penta, in any and all institutions and our endeavors that use the word Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2034.719s">And</a> I think it's something that's wise, and I want to applaud Councilor Penta for expanding on the gentleman's views. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2039.682s">So</a> thank you very much, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2191.049s">Quick</a> question for the gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2193.784s">Well,</a> I'd just like to know, do you have press credentials? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2196.146s">Because</a> when other reporters come to this meeting, I notice they actually have credentials issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2204.913s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2205.854s">I'm</a> published in eight books, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2207.175s">I</a> just finished another book. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2208.276s">Do</a> you have press credentials from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2210.417s">Yes</a> or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2210.838s">It's</a> very easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2211.879s">I</a> have my own press credentials, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2213.8s">From</a> the Commonwealth?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2349.998s">I</a> withdraw to receive and place on file.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2553.178s">Do</a> I have a paper on that?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2586.992s">To</a> hear from the Chief of Police as well as concerned citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2590.974s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4760.724s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4761.725s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4762.605s">To</a> the Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4763.146s">Waited</a> patiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4764.686s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4765.587s">And</a> I'm just a little confused because I'm hearing some different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4770.296s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4770.496s">Blackburn,</a> well respected in our community, her years of service in the school department, Councilor Marks, yourself, Marguerite Lynch, Anthony Santoro sat on the original committee back in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4780.021s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4782.302s">Well,</a> 2008 into 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4784.143s">And</a> I went back to some of my old archive records. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4788.245s">The</a> recommendations were the agreement consensus that consistent parking enforcement is needed to provide efficient turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4795.386s">for</a> pocket spaces to assist the local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4798.233s">And</a> one of the members actually was on there as a representative of the Chamber of Commerce at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4802.262s">It's</a> like any other agency or group. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4804.977s">turn</a> over, so that's who was sitting there at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4807.978s">Number</a> two was this particular group recommended parking controls are needed, meters slash kiosks, freestanding pay stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4815.621s">That</a> was number two for the recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4818.142s">And</a> it goes on to say that the parking rules must be fair and consistently enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4823.283s">Now</a> this was back in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4825.344s">Leading</a> up to this, I know there was a first bid that went out <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4828.798s">that</a> consisted of parking enforcement with a parking garage element at Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4835.082s">There</a> wasn't the votes on the Medford City Council to support the garage at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4839.305s">We</a> actually have members that don't even sit on the council anymore that were here for that particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4845.638s">those</a> particular discussions and I would have rather have seen the garage built with strict enforcement and then look at other areas but as far as all the recommendations it looks like a lot of them <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4860.515s">are</a> with this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4861.896s">Now</a> leading up to that, one thing that I disagree with totally on the mayor's plan is, and I said this at the Committee of the Whole meeting back in January, I would have rather seen the freestanding meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4872.903s">I</a> think senior citizens know how to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4875.205s">They're</a> much more, they're much more user-friendly, but I also see the total other side of it where, up near Tufts University now, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4888.165s">People</a> that are living in our community and utilizing up there, everyone, they don't even go into a coffee shop without cash anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4895.291s">Everything</a> is debit card, credit card driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4898.373s">But</a> there is the technology out there that could be standalone meters with kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4903.737s">And</a> I made that loud and clear known at the meeting in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4907.7s">It</a> was actually part of the committee report that was adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4910.622s">But</a> as I said that evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4912.842s">we're</a> making recommendations to the mayor and ultimately this council gave him the authority to go out and up to a ten-year contract by a seven to nothing vote uh... and it leads us back to ultimately given the fact that he's the mayor duly elected by the majority of this community he is the signatory authority uh... at moving any contracts forward so uh... that was really the only piece that this city council had a hand in what i'd like to see them go the route with the <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4942.08s">quarter</a> meters that you just throw in that people have been using. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4944.701s">I</a> remember the quarter meters over in Somerville or over in Charlestown when we were little kids going to get shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4950.544s">You'd</a> throw a quarter in the meter back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4952.524s">People</a> knew how to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4953.445s">They're</a> so user friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4954.945s">But</a> I just think there could have been more public, leading up to this now, the rollout I think could have been publicized more. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4963.669s">This</a> piece of paper is very informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4965.83s">I</a> think it should have been in the hands a little bit sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4968.405s">The</a> other recommendation I would have liked to have seen is started it not in the middle of the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4973.127s">Start</a> it when it's nice out so that people could go up to a machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4975.949s">And</a> right now, I mean, I couldn't even carry my tea in tonight because it was so cold going from the car to here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4982.352s">If</a> I had to run to a kiosk, I'd rather just get the ticket and pay it, I think, because it was so cold out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4988.335s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4991.525s">I</a> think the city has to continue doing outreach, utilizing the 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4997.772s">We</a> get phone calls to say they just put the chalk lines on the baseball field. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5002.136s">This</a> is something big that we should be getting three or four calls on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5005.119s">The</a> outreach, the outreach, the outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5008.985s">The</a> other thing that I'd like to bring up is just to say how we got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5013.248s">This</a> was an initial recommendation of several members of our community that had many recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5019.213s">And</a> after it went from here, the original commission, yourself, Councilor Marks, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5024.416s">Blackburn,</a> and other people, at that point, it was in the hands of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5028.519s">And</a> it sat there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5029.54s">And</a> then it came back to us at one portion just to give the authority to do the 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5036.853s">I</a> just wanna be clear to the people out there that, and you gotta remember too, the last time the halls were this, it was over the trash removal and the recycling bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5049.396s">But</a> given time, people did get in the groove. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5052.136s">I'd</a> like to think that the individual needs of areas like Jimmy's Pizza, areas like the senior center, I'm not singling out Jimmy's Pizza, but you know, the business communities in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5065.983s">Let's</a> be cognizant when we're putting in those free spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5068.836s">If</a> we have to add a couple more. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5070.897s">so</a> that people can run in and do their business and get out right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5074.44s">But</a> I'll be the first one to say, the person that takes that spot for 15 minutes, if it's a 15-minute spot to do a quick errand, and they're there 16 minutes, shame on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5082.585s">They</a> should get double the ticket, because the next person should have the 15 minutes and the 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5088.409s">So</a> I'd just like to get a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5091.631s">Not</a> a commitment, I understand you can't, but that things will be tweaked and looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5096.495s">Because</a> there is stuff, like you said, the senior center, just last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5100.267s">that</a> was thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5101.868s">And</a> there's going to be other areas that you think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5104.45s">The</a> other thing that's very, very important, places of worship in all the funeral parlors in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5110.035s">I</a> actually did some research on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5112.217s">Those</a> meters, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is very important for the people in our community that practice their faith and their religious beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5122.48s">venues</a> that they will be bagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5124.481s">There'll</a> be an actual bag or something all over it on the weekends that says, uh, masks don't whatever the case may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5131.304s">And</a> the mayor has assured me that that will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5134.086s">Are</a> you under that impression as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5135.206s">They're</a> bagged or they're just not enforced during that time.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5173.25s">Any</a> of those things are more of a common sense way of doing the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5177.374s">And</a> the other thing that, um, that I'm glad the mayor listened to this council on, cause I actually made a recommendation, um, back when we had another piece of this whole puzzle, the other area where the city council was involved, it was the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5189.403s">to</a> combine two of the commissions and give the authority to one commission rather than an off-street parking commission and a traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5196.046s">You</a> get too many hands in the soup, the soup gets spoiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5198.487s">So</a> we successfully, as a council, passed that, sent it to the state house, the governor signed it, and it came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5204.74s">But</a> one recommendation that I made, and it's in the official records, were to have resident parking only commuters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5211.244s">Because</a> too many people from Winchester, not only some of them are coming down here and taking spots, they're leaving their trash in our trash barrels because they have to go to dump in Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5219.07s">And</a> that is totally unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5220.811s">And</a> quite honestly, it's larceny, as far as I'm concerned, or illegal dumping, because it's our taxpayers that are footing the bill on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5227.655s">But</a> it is up to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5230.237s">I</a> do see some tweaking getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5232.198s">which</a> I think people have to understand that this is slow process, similar to the trash barrel situation where I had more phone calls on the trash barrel, similar to this situation, and how many people were going to need three, four, five barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5243.545s">And</a> if you talk to the DPW, there's not many households that actually purchased the additional barrel at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5248.828s">But</a> in Winchester, Winchester is totally expanding their program right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5256.282s">as</a> we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5257.323s">They</a> just put their brand new kiosks in Winchester Center, and actually our kiosks are better. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5263.652s">I</a> haven't used one yet, but at least the numbers are bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5267.537s">In</a> Winchester, the keypad is tiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5270.272s">It's</a> tiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5270.892s">And</a> I know this, this council wanted to make sure that everything was ADA compliant and the mayor is very serious when it comes to that stuff too, as, as yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5278.158s">But,</a> um, that's, that's all I really have to say at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5281.7s">But,</a> uh, I just, what I stated regarding the initial report, pretty fairly accurate because I'm hearing different things that, that that committee never wanted kiosk meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5290.547s">But</a> now when you look at it, it's actually one of the recommendations.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5437.374s">Councilor,</a> with all due respect, I took the same exact votes in this whole program as you and every other member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5441.757s">So,</a> Mr. President, just if I could finish.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5536.965s">Councilor</a> Camuso, if you'd like to complete your remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5540.287s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5540.647s">I</a> can conclude with two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5541.788s">And</a> just to follow up on what Councilor Mack said, and I did say that after the recommendations came by his committee for all these recommendations, it was in the mayor's hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5549.573s">He's</a> the signatory authority and the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5551.814s">And</a> to say that I supported it and now I'm not, we all supported it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5556.237s">Seven</a> members of this council gave, had our- I didn't support this language.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5622.077s">Councilor</a> Camuso has the floor, and then Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5624.998s">Just</a> two last things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5626.659s">In</a> the last few days, I had several members of our community reach out to me about the signs on the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5631.16s">I</a> worked with the DPW today, as well as the Mayor's office, and all the signs have been removed from the trees, and <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5638.803s">Unfortunately,</a> I know Councilor Marks over the years, this has been something he's been a stickler about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5642.785s">But</a> some of the existing signs that were, they took down and put them over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5647.847s">They</a> were never removed in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5649.708s">So</a> shame on the city for allowing them to linger up there.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5654.63s">Further</a> clarification.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5693.227s">last</a> but not least we have business owners in this community that have consistently parked their vehicles in front of their stores year after year after year and you know what the only people that suffer are them and the consumers when they pull up and they have to park three miles away because you got an ice cream store or you have a vendor <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5715.741s">I</a> mean, they don't even try to disguise it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5717.943s">The</a> name of the companies on the side of the truck that sits out there all day long, or the car that sits out there all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5723.188s">I</a> think, I think today driving through the squares, I think some of the business owners now are taking the appropriate steps to leave the spots for the consumers, like us, when we show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5738.06s">I</a> think they're already seeing an impact, because you got good business in the community, like the guys that are sitting out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5743.543s">They'll</a> go deliver some food and then park their car half a mile away so that somebody can park in front of their store. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5749.347s">There's</a> not many people that do that, I hate to say, throughout our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5752.849s">And</a> it's obvious, because half the trucks are leaded that say the name of the business and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5758.112s">So</a> that's it for now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6117.813s">Why</a> are we discussing all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6121.354s">Point</a> of information, a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6123.755s">My</a> understanding is for doing deliveries to the company or the company doing a quick pickup and heading out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6129.977s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6130.492s">It's</a> not for customers, it's a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6131.852s">But</a> the nature of a certain business, if it's one of those... No, but he's talking about getting paint shaken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6136.793s">That's</a> a customer going in and getting paint shaken up.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6143.634s">Well,</a> I challenge you to go up there and buy some paint and see if you get a ticket when you come out, because that's not the purpose of a loading zone.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7396.83s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7397.25s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7399.052s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7399.352s">And</a> Mrs. B, thank you for, for your clarification or the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7403.395s">I</a> was just referring that I said after you guys made the original initial recommendations at that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7409.695s">The</a> only person that could do anything was the mayor, because he's the signatory authority.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7420.5s">Well,</a> the committee that you were on, though, did make recommendations for kiosks and meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7424.081s">So</a> if you want the paper, I'll give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7426.142s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8649.803s">This</a> is technology today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8651.945s">The</a> City of Medford actually charges a fee when you pay your tax bills online or a parking citation currently through the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8658.611s">So</a> I just want to let Councilor Penta know.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9731.397s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9734.46s">This</a> city council asked the mayor's office specifically to have a grace period on violations and enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9740.925s">So</a> I'm assuming this is the grace period.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9745.369s">We</a> asked for at least a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9748.011s">We</a> asked for a month.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9797.098s">But</a> it's not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9797.759s">We</a> can't.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10398.609s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10399.69s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10400.991s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10401.711s">And,</a> um, a portion of that too, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10405.351s">set</a> up by this council and the administration is earmarked to go right back into community development in the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10412.175s">So</a> whether it's hiring a consultant to try to bring in more business, whatever the case, whether it's physical infrastructure improvements of a particular square. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10422.781s">So</a> this council, working with the solicitor's office and the mayor's office, we're adamant that a portion of this does go back to the business districts that are affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10433.166s">Thank</a> you, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10435.011s">Councilor</a> Penta, did you have a point of information?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10943.88s">I</a> think he's referring to the ticket writers.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10949.785s">Good</a> luck.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11018.408s">Thank</a> you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11020.549s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11022.2s">If</a> I may, this brings up a follow up question and this would be to the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11026.522s">There</a> are some traditionally we know which streets right now in the community of resident permit parking only. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11033.604s">I'm</a> assuming there's going to be a residual effect on this because now people are going to be leaving place dead road to park and they're going to be parking up the side streets and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11041.908s">At</a> this point, there's some scuttlebutt out there that there's other streets that were added as resident parking permit recently in anticipation of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11049.691s">Is</a> that true or false?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11052.05s">That's</a> false.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11122.853s">And</a> that would be up to, because I know exactly what he's referring to, the Cottage Street that I talked to you about.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11129.736s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11157.852s">And</a> then, um, my second follow up question is regarding the, uh, the streets and the permit streets for the viewing public, because there will be the residual effect like, um, some street that's not already residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11167.798s">People</a> may try to, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11169.339s">beat</a> the system, I'm not going to pay the $5 to park on Police Dead Road, so I'm going to go to one of those streets, Century Woods, Roberts, anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11179.511s">If</a> any streets see an influx of vehicles parking, they should get together and petition the community, the City of Medford, through the Chief and the Traffic Commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11187.841s">to</a> take a look at making it resident permit parking, because I know that you and the Traffic Commission, what's the official name now? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11196.912s">Traffic</a> Commission, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11197.733s">Still</a> Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11199.555s">With</a> the merging of the off-street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11202.962s">But</a> with that being said, I think people have to be cognizant of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11206.084s">If</a> you see an additional people park on your street, and traditionally you can tell when they're out of town is because they have stickers for the dump in Winchester or Lexington Boys and Girls Club or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11217.752s">So,</a> but if you see an influx of that, bring it to our attention as a city council, the mayor or the chief, and we'll get you before the traffic commission and the chief will do his due diligence.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11234.463s">Have</a> a hearing.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11247.294s">Well,</a> I'm glad I'm glad you updated the council miss because there was a lot of banter going back and forth that all half the city now is resident permit parking only that they Because of this and at this point there's only been one addition to the last one was Hamilton Hamilton Street And that was two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11262.165s">Okay</a> before this was even and for this because this is going live, can you work with the city administration to maybe get the the <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11271.221s">the</a> traffic commission's agenda on the city webpage, so people can take a look at it and see what streets around them may be affected by it, and then you can have maximum input from the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11282.547s">Thank</a> you, Chief.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12187.747s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12189.309s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuto. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12190.59s">Either</a> yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12191.671s">Not</a> to throw this gentleman under the bus, but normal person says you don't put the sign on the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12199.768s">I</a> mean, the guy's acknowledging he made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12202.25s">You</a> want to beat him up? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12202.991s">Who</a> didn't tell him? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12203.571s">The</a> chief, the police?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12206.874s">I</a> understand, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12207.795s">But</a> did you lock your car when you come in tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12209.516s">Yes,</a> I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12209.816s">Did</a> you lock your car?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12211.357s">I</a> mean, we're going volley here on ridiculous stuff now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12216.402s">No,</a> that's in your mind.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12233.543s">To</a> follow up on that, Aggie Tudin was very, very helpful in straightening the situation out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12238.046s">So</a> kudos to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12240.528s">I'm</a> not sure if she actually talked to you or someone in your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12242.869s">She's</a> our tree warden here and arborist. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12245.431s">And</a> she was very concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12248.351s">She</a> took the bull by the horns on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12249.733s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7303.901s">Mr.</a> Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7305.301s">14-472.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7306.661s">Mr.</a> Councilor, Mr. Solicitor, we had a meeting of the committee of the whole where we were presented, members were here that are in the audience this evening were at that meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7316.821s">and</a> they participated in that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7318.822s">It</a> was packed and it was in the room right over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7322.064s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7326.947s">You</a> had a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7328.348s">Your</a> point is over.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7340.816s">Name</a> and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7347.831s">doing</a> it for 30 years, maybe it's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7350.876s">That's</a> right, I have a half a brain like you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7353.84s">Name</a> and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7355.142s">John</a> Starrar, still. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7357.385s">You</a> might be right behind me, councillor, for all you know.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7389.667s">Councilor,</a> you just corrected yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7391.187s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7393.389s">That</a> we would have a meeting, nothing to do with another vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7491.305s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Torello. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7492.866s">Name</a> and address for the record, sir.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7642.734s">It's</a> something you'd have to bring up with the mayor, because we gave him the authority to sign the 10-year contract.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7655.821s">I'm</a> just being upfront and telling you the truth.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7844.098s">And</a> I'd like your point about the reverse 911 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7846.558s">Just</a> come up so the people at home can hear you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8145.484s">DJ,</a> just so you know, you are being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8149.926s">The</a> Chamber of Commerce has worked very, very, very diligently, and I think we've seen results in that with the press release that went out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8157.889s">So</a> it's not going to be $400 come January 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8161.551s">It's</a> $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8162.291s">The</a> business permit and the commuter permit is staying the same, which people already should be paying down. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8167.797s">in</a> the business lot, either that or they're parking illegally already.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8185.36s">But</a> as far as the business permit, there is no change. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8187.4s">As</a> you know, a hundred dollars up until now.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8190.281s">The</a> police, as the chief said, I've been very busy with other stuff, but technically if you don't have a sticker right now in that parking lot, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8196.92s">you</a> should be ticketed and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8198.301s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8203.485s">60</a> days, as the chief mentioned earlier, this is going to be a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8207.488s">This</a> is probably very fluid, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8208.749s">Chief.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8209.67s">And</a> uh, as needs come up,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8223.775s">But</a> that's currently right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8225.476s">No,</a> I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8226.197s">If</a> your people are parking in that lot without a permit on their vehicle right now, they're illegally parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8230.9s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8231.4s">As</a> well as the businesses in Medford Square are doing the same thing as the Governor's Avalon. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8235.784s">People</a> are used to lax enforcement around here.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8261.855s">So</a> just, just so everyone knows, including yourself, all the members of the council, I think we're asked a similar question when the city solicitor and the mayor presented this, everyone thinks it's an automatic 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8275.624s">It's</a> similar to the trash and recycling program that happened when this place was filled to the rafters. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8282.228s">We</a> still heard some complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8283.789s">We</a> worked on it as we moved forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8285.811s">But</a> most importantly, there is a clause that we can get out of this by purchasing the equipment.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8291.487s">And</a> our city solicitor, as you know, is top notch.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8296.81s">And</a> if for some reason they want to overturn this at some point, there'll be a dollar value, but it can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8306.936s">But</a> tell your employees they've been lucky they haven't got ticketed in that lot without their pocket permits up to this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8326.582s">Um,</a> if I could just make one announcement from the chair to park Medford is up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8331.488s">You</a> can actually get the application on your smartphones. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8334.371s">Um,</a> it's a pretty interesting website. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8337.595s">I</a> was fooling around with it tonight before the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8339.777s">So,</a> uh,
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8354.015s">Somebody</a> can go to 577 Main Street on Medford Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8360.558s">575</a> Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8361.458s">There'll</a> be a fully operational business meeting place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8365.8s">And</a> this was worked on in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8367.968s">as</a> well as the Chamber of Commerce and everyone else involved wanted to make sure that there was a place where people can go on a full-time basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8375.152s">So</a> people are actually going to be able to get the answers quicker now than currently coming to City Hall where the tax office and everyone else has been doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8382.035s">So</a> hopefully that's helpful, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8473.591s">All</a> right, we have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8476.298s">On</a> the motion for approval with the seasonal passes from Councilor Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Caraviello to look at the program 60 days after its inception, and Councilor Marks to get a listing of all the commuter, commuter residential, permit parking, if it goes into the general fund, and if not, what fund it goes to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8494.494s">Is</a> that correct, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8496.616s">All</a> those in favor?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8502.888s">That's</a> what the council is stating.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8514.373s">After</a> the 30-day grace period.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8539.587s">Did</a> I say that right?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8541.367s">Teja.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8541.928s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8542.828s">76</a> 4th Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8544.508s">For</a> the Lighthouse, 20 High Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8547.989s">Chair</a> recognizes Vice President Caraviello.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8581.476s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8582.236s">Another</a> Medford resident? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8583.536s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8583.756s">Give</a> him back to his city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8584.617s">Good</a> luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8585.197s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8586.677s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8587.037s">Have</a> a nice holiday.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8625.638s">On</a> the motion for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8627.66s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8628.32s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8629.661s">The</a> ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8630.382s">Good</a> luck.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8632.924s">Also,</a> while we're in the suspension, 14-788. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8634.625s">This</a> is the appropriate funds and authorize the mayor on the grant to preserve land for public park known as the Crystal Campbell Memorial Peace Guard.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8796.955s">Thank</a> you, Lauren. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8797.515s">And</a> if I may, from the chair, we have a paper before us that gave the annual, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8803.809s">price</a> for mulching and the fountain service, and it's $3,000 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8807.911s">Does</a> the council ask for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8809.751s">And</a> then the electricity costs for the fountain to operate in the lighting is estimated at $1,500 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8815.813s">So</a> thank you for answering these important questions before the council has voted on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8820.015s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8820.415s">Councilor</a> Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8821.636s">Move</a> approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8823.896s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8824.757s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9383.821s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9771.945s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9791.331s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9811.862s">Thank</a> you for your point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10098.574s">Can</a> we start talking about tragedies though?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10185.22s">Well,</a> pick up the phone, and I'm sure you will.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10223.5s">Councilor</a> Knight, point of, no, no, go with your clarification.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10263.232s">Your</a> point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10264.292s">That's</a> my point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10265.732s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10266.072s">And</a> I'm trying to give you as much leeway as I can, but Councilor Knight has been patiently waiting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10377.773s">We</a> have a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10379.114s">And</a> we have a second motion from Councilor Marks to deduct $250,000 from the petition that's before us for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10389.318s">And</a> that is the funding from Wynn Resorts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10392.299s">We're</a> going to call that vote first. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10393.96s">A</a> yes vote is to eliminate the fountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10399.242s">A</a> yes vote will be to eliminate the fountains <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10403.349s">and</a> the $250,000 for the Crystal Campbell Memorial Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10406.992s">A</a> no vote will then bring the final vote back to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10411.595s">So</a> this is on Councilor Marks' first paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10416.82s">A</a> yes vote is to eliminate the fountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10422.504s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10423.265s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10424.946s">Roll</a> call has been requested by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10429.65s">The</a> clerk will call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10444.864s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10445.124s">By</a> a vote of three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10449.987s">We</a> now have the paper before us to fund the crystal Campbell memorial peace garden as presented by the mayor without cutting out the fountains at this site. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10462.848s">And</a> roll call has been requested, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10467.389s">Would</a> you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10469.85s">You</a> want to speak or you want?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10661.442s">Can</a> I just, I listen, I understand where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10664.343s">It's</a> a financial decision to you at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10667.144s">I</a> think everyone made their points. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10669.394s">In</a> the interest of holiday spirit and this isn't tragic, I'm just trying to do right by the body and take a vote to move forward.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10819.488s">And</a> before the roll is called, Councilor Lungo-Koehnan and Councilor Marks, but I'm glad they picked that location because it's not only going to be great for the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10828.196s">This</a> young woman lived about a hundred yards from the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10833.361s">So</a> there's some significance in my vote with that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10839.994s">Councilor</a> Lengelkern and Councilor Larkin.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as/2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as.html">Medford City Council - December 16, 2014</a></h2>

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=318.34s">You</a> looking to do the levy? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=320.582s">Reducing</a> the tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=321.983s">This</a> is the budget that was passed by four members of this council in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=325.106s">So</a> there's going to be a million dollars in cuts or the mayor has to submit a certified letter stating that he wants to appropriate a million dollars or your amount under free cash.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=403.407s">So</a> I completely disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=405.628s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=485.488s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Dello Russo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=651.5s">Point</a> of further information, Councilor De La Ruza.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=867.449s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn, you have the floor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1135.775s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1137.216s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1138.316s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Kerr.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1174.822s">There</a> were four members of the council that approved the budget and I was not one of them, so I can't speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1181.183s">Councilor</a> Penta, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight, then Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1426.42s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Dello Russo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1640.768s">Councilor</a> Marks and then Councilor Caraviello, Vice President Caraviello.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1903.893s">One</a> question for, and this is to move the conversation forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1907.994s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn has an amendment to the original paper here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1911.675s">If</a> the million dollar request is approved, where is the million dollars going to come to fund the budget that's currently in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1920.578s">That</a> would be certified free cash if the mayor submitted it, or would it be cuts?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1928.839s">If</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn's motion is approved to cut the levy by $1 million, where will that be made up from? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1938.623s">It'll</a> just come out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1940.063s">But</a> that would have to be submitted by the mayor requesting us to take the free cash.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1954.258s">The</a> request before us would basically be to cut the levy by $1 million and ask the mayor to submit a paper back to the council for certified free cash for that amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1964.36s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1983.054s">That's</a> going to get voted on after the main paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1986.395s">But</a> if it goes through, the only way to fund that million dollars would be through either cuts or certified free cash.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2045.066s">We're</a> sending the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2045.806s">What</a> happens if it's 2010, though, when we were negative $500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2048.028s">It's</a> not going to be like 2010 with Director Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2051.771s">Well,</a> with all due respect, we have a new governor that they're looking at 9C cuts right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2055.293s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2055.994s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2057.715s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2058.315s">Let</a> me turn you on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2059.276s">And</a> then, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2125.741s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, Vice President Caraviello was correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2128.183s">The</a> budget that was approved was not the mayor's original number.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2171.23s">Well,</a> we're all asking for a police station too, which is on the horizon, hopefully.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2182.795s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2198.926s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2298.141s">That's</a> Rep Donato and his colleagues.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2301.682s">Can't</a> have your cake and eat it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2399.163s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2400.223s">Thank</a> you, Vice President.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2440.866s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2441.606s">There's</a> a motion for the first question before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2445.335s">is</a> to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2015 by selecting the minimum residential factor, which the council has historically chosen this before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2457.564s">If</a> this is, once again, the council's choice, the minimum residential factor is 0.899216 on the motion of Councilor Dello Russo for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2468.632s">The</a> clerk will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2471.675s">He</a> has a different paper that's going to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2474.095s">Your</a> paper is item 14-784. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2479.298s">Councilor,</a> we'll run this meeting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2489.284s">There's</a> been a ruling of the chair requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2492.466s">The</a> clerk will call the roll on the ruling of the chair.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2501.756s">Let</a> me turn this on so the people at home can see your behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2503.697s">I</a> think you should hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2505.018s">The</a> amendment precedes the main motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2507.62s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2507.9s">Know</a> your rules of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2509.101s">Thank</a> you, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2510.882s">Clerk</a> will call the roll on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2513.043s">It's</a> been before us for a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2514.264s">It's</a> not, uh, it's not, it's not, section 22 is not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2519.707s">The</a> clerk will call the roll on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2526.083s">Vice</a> President Caraviello, before the motion is called.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2587.811s">So</a> on the challenge of the chair, we have a gentleman that would like to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2596.877s">Name</a> and address for the record, sir.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2812.011s">Name</a> and address for the record.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2966.213s">Now,</a> if you're going to take our money... The raise is for all members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2969.495s">Seven</a> members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2970.896s">Four</a> members voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2972.596s">The</a> entire council voted for the raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2974.317s">Check</a> the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2978.039s">It's</a> absolutely true, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2982.762s">We</a> will take... We'll give you the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2983.883s">Go</a> ahead, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2984.303s">You</a> have the floor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2990.386s">We'll</a> provide you with a copy of the minutes.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3225.136s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3230.14s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3230.66s">And</a> for the record, for the gentleman that was just at the podium, paper 14-098, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3236.757s">There</a> was a motion by Councilor Marks on a roll call vote of three in the affirmative and four in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3240.58s">The</a> amendments failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3242.021s">And</a> then on the final motion regarding the increase to pay for the department heads and the city council was included. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3247.585s">It</a> was upon the motion by President Calamuso from the floor that all three readings be waived and to be ordained on a roll call vote of seven in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3256.331s">That's</a> all members of this council and zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3259.133s">And</a> it was ordained.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3280.882s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3282.582s">The</a> city auditor.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3338.565s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3645.76s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3646.08s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Lengelkorn, do you have a dollar amount? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3648.662s">$1</a> million, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3651.624s">No,</a> you said $980,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3658.128s">And</a> did you calculate what the minimum residential factor is going to be if indeed this passes? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3663.792s">So</a> when we get to that vote?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3667.726s">That</a> will stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3668.827s">No,</a> it won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3669.487s">That</a> will change as well if we- No, it stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3671.989s">It</a> stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3672.59s">It</a> stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3673.411s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3689.083s">This</a> is similar to the paper she has later in the meeting.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3695.494s">We're</a> going to vote on Council Lungo's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3698.336s">A</a> motion to reduce the tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3700.637s">Do</a> you want to, Council Lungo-Koehn? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3702.298s">Explain</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3703.479s">Can</a> we make a motion to table it, take your other paper, and then whatever the results of your other paper is.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3809.752s">On</a> the question where this is a money paper, this will be a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3814.854s">Clerk</a> will call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3835.12s">$1,000,000</a> and insert the other number.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6127.797s">And</a> I may add that Melrose recently just updated their policy to be very inclusive as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6133.458s">It</a> was reported today in the Statehouse News. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6135.859s">So</a> I hate to be behind Melrose, but we're right behind them, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6140.78s">Ours</a> is better. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6141.64s">Is</a> there a motion?

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=454.75s">Point</a> of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=456.503s">Councilor</a> DelaRosa.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=466.27s">It's,</a> uh, under the purview of the committee, according to the whole new petition that was established years ago.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=486.988s">or</a> the mayor, um, council Burke is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=489.929s">And</a> just for the viewing public, it was an open meeting that was publicly posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=493.051s">So</a> any member of the community, as well as city council, a school committee or anyone else could have attended.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=502.435s">Baker</a> is not here.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=512.101s">What</a> was the reason agenda item? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=513.484s">It's</a> year two of the lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=515.488s">These</a> were already purchased by the city of Medford in previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=519.216s">And</a> at this point they have to be paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=521.596s">for</a> year two of the lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=522.617s">It's</a> pretty self-explanatory.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=530.604s">No,</a> you didn't.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=532.826s">That's</a> year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=533.246s">Number</a> seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=533.587s">You</a> also asked about number four.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=540.893s">Why</a> aren't we buying? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=542.262s">The</a> city administration asked us to lease these two vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=544.983s">If</a> we recall during budget time, they talked about several trucks that were destroyed last year because of, uh, I don't know if it was actual fires or it was a very bad snow removal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=556.429s">And,</a> uh, as far as why they chose to go this route, you'll have to ask the city administration that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=571.394s">So</a> we're only going to use these trucks for one year at $26,000 each. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=574.836s">No,</a> this is the first year we're getting the two trucks for the first year payment of $26,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=578.979s">I</a> don't understand why we're leasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=585.243s">This</a> is payment for year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=587.604s">When</a> year two comes around, I'm sure there'll be another funding mechanism in place that will either be budgeted through the next fiscal year's budget or the mayor would be coming back to us for funding for year two of the lease, similar to what he did in item number four.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=624.792s">For</a> the edification, Madam President, if I may interject, it's not for one truck, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=629.475s">As</a> the agenda item says, it's for two trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=631.997s">So</a> the $100,000 is divided by two. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=633.978s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=634.598s">So</a> I don't want to be misleading to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=635.999s">OK,</a> so why aren't we buying them?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=719.957s">Can</a> we get a copy of the official minutes forwarded to the Council once they are written up, please?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=734.856s">You</a> all set Councilor Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=736.057s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=736.777s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=738.599s">Councilor</a> Lungo, Kern, and then Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=857.418s">Just</a> to keep the upfront costs low.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=876.082s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=926.397s">Stumps</a> and sidewalks has been amended to read 300 in the council paper.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=933.941s">On</a> the motion of councilor Dello Russo for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=937.122s">For</a> approval of what?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=951.615s">This</a> is one paper submitted by the administration and it has items broken down and it's broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=956.618s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=957.619s">Um,</a> name and address for the record.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1103.218s">Can</a> we take the items one at a time and just... If the council wishes, you can press us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1108.705s">You</a> can ask for a severance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1110.126s">But</a> the ruling of the chair is if the council can ask for a severance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1115.589s">But</a> as far as this paper, it's not individually going into separate accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1119.931s">It's</a> one paper from certified free cash for a specific purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1124.533s">It's</a> not actually putting it into one account to another at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1128.015s">So</a> that's the ruling of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1129.396s">But</a> if the council wishes to sever each one and there's a majority of members that want that, we certainly can do that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1150.352s">You</a> can make a motion to sever?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1153.574s">There</a> is a motion to sever, Councilor Dello Russo.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1644.129s">All</a> members of the public were able to attend the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1648.958s">were</a> able to attend the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1650.798s">So</a> let's not say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1652.619s">I</a> said some. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1653.599s">You</a> said, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1655.279s">And</a> I just corrected myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1656.68s">And</a> I corrected it for you.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1659.66s">So</a> we do have rule number 20 that says any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1669.942s">The</a> councillor has requested that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1671.263s">There's</a> a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1673.063s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1673.843s">It's</a> automatic, Paul.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1678.323s">It's</a> automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1679.244s">You're</a> asked to lay on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1681.245s">No,</a> it's laid on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1682.106s">We'll</a> see that next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1682.987s">Madam</a> president. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1684.007s">Madam</a> vice director.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1686.649s">Well,</a> the motion of council Dello Russo to revert back to the regular order of business council Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1699.238s">That</a> paper has been tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1701.3s">There</a> is another paper, which 14, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1706.782s">7-4-4.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1711.025s">Mr.</a> President, members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $90,000 for structural repairs to the Carriage House, in addition to various roofing and sprinkler repairs at the Brooks Estates, a representative from M-Belt, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1727.193s">will</a> be in attendance to answer any questions you may have.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2035.01s">Ayes</a> have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2040.774s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2044.253s">Uh,</a> I want to apologize as the chair, the last paper that we're just tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2048.657s">Uh,</a> if there's a motion to bring them back before us, uh, we will entertain them this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2056.803s">Is</a> that a motion council Dello Russo on the motion of council Dello Russo to take the papers back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2062.828s">All</a> those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2065.27s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2066.031s">We</a> were under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2067.872s">All</a> rules were suspended at the time of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2070.014s">The</a> paper can be back before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2072.793s">Yes,</a> there was a vote of suspension of the rules by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2076.236s">That</a> is the chair's ruling. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2078.218s">The</a> paper is back before us if the council wants to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2082.543s">You</a> can doubt the ruling of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2083.624s">The</a> ruling of the chair is in doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2087.568s">The</a> ruling will be called if a yes vote will be to <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2093.354s">Um,</a> a yes vote will be to say that we were not under suspension of the rules and a no vote on the challenge of the chair will acknowledge that we were indeed under suspension of the rules and therefore the rules were out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2104.98s">So</a> a yes vote is for Councilor Pinter's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2108.121s">A</a> no vote is the ruling of the chair to support the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2111.723s">The</a> clerk will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2115.385s">You</a> want a question before the roll is called? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2118.306s">Well,</a> we have to find out if it's back before us first. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2120.488s">So</a> we have to rule on the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2123.956s">All</a> right, I'm going to explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2128.101s">When</a> we first opened up the order of business, a member of the Medford City Council asked for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2135.089s">All</a> members of this council acknowledged that we would go under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2138.273s">Therefore,</a> rule number 20 in every other rule of the Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2142.831s">is</a> suspended. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2143.912s">It's</a> clear as day when you think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2145.393s">This</a> is, uh, we suspended our own rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2148.095s">So</a> I actually ruled wrong on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2149.856s">Council</a> Dello Russo asked for the paper to be back before us as a result of being under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2155.32s">And</a> we're here now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2156.181s">So</a> a yes vote is to <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2160.556s">Uphold</a> Councilor Penter's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2163.278s">A</a> no vote is to stand by the chair that we were indeed under suspension of the rules originally when these papers were before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2171.584s">Yes?</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2183.773s">We</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2184.053s">We</a> didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2185.294s">It</a> was a mechanism of the rules.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2198.069s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2198.309s">So</a> ruling of the chair originally was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2200.79s">We</a> were under suspension of the rules council. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2202.431s">We're</a> going to take the vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2229.632s">It</a> doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2231.294s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2232.265s">We're</a> going to take a vote on your challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2234.727s">It's</a> simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2235.167s">If</a> we were under suspension of the rules, your rule would be valid, would not be valid. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2239.15s">If</a> we were not under suspension of the rules, then we would be standing by your rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2243.113s">The</a> chair will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2243.993s">A</a> yes vote is for Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2245.955s">A</a> no vote is to uphold the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2247.796s">The</a> clerk will call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2267.173s">We're</a> going to take a ruling on the chair, and then we're going to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2269.914s">Because</a> if your ruling is upheld by Councilor Penta, the clerk will call the roll on the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2275.795s">There's</a> going to be no debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2280.717s">The</a> debate, the point is moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2284.158s">If</a> Councilor Penta prevails, you'll be the first one to speak after the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2288.319s">Call</a> the roll, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2292.582s">It's</a> not before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2293.763s">Can</a> you call the roll?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2297.568s">There's</a> a challenge to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2299.189s">A</a> challenge to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2301.472s">A</a> challenge of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2304.075s">stops</a> debate until we take that challenge and rule on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2307.438s">We're</a> taking the vote right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2309.119s">Clerk</a> will call the roll.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2326.138s">That's</a> the proper, listen, under suspension, just call the vote, a yes vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2330.443s">I'm</a> gonna move, you know something?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2368.618s">You're</a> on your own, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2369.839s">You're</a> absolutely right.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2379.163s">It</a> hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2379.744s">I'll</a> call it as I see it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2381.705s">Councilor,</a> can we take a vote on the ruling of the chair, and then are we going to debate the paper, or it's going to be up before us next week?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2396.992s">Councilor,</a> I don't know why you would... Well, I think we all know what took place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2400.694s">Let's</a> take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2401.334s">If</a> we were under suspension of the rules... Can we just take a vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2404.755s">Because</a> we might... Oh, she had a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2409.076s">When</a> you challenge the chair, you're supposed to take precedent over everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2413.538s">Councilor,</a> what are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2414.478s">Debate</a> the whole issue and then take a ruling on your challenge? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2416.879s">You</a> can't do it.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2419.98s">I</a> mean... Oh.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2434.393s">Councilor,</a> if you realize, um, if you realize lately, members of this council have been asking for a suspension of rule number 33, specifically to take agenda items out of order because of your exact point, you're an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2445.458s">You</a> should know that once you suspend the rules, it's all the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2448.42s">You're</a> suspending the rules for the item that's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2450.841s">You're</a> suspending the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2452.162s">It's</a> clear as day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2452.962s">It's</a> clear as day.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2455.283s">Well,</a> let's take a vote in the majority of members of the council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2461.24s">Could</a> you read Rule 20 again, so everyone understands it? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2464.843s">Rule</a> 20 is a very straightforward rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2468.026s">Councilor</a> Pender read it, I will read it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2470.828s">But</a> as I stated, if all the rules are suspended, that includes number 20, number 33, and everything else in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2479.976s">So</a> Rule 20, would you like me to read it from the top? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2482.778s">Well,</a> I mean, if I understand it correctly, the tables have been weak. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2488.991s">It</a> certainly does, but if all the rules are suspended, then all the rules are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2492.259s">Look,</a> if we want to table it for a week, I have no problem doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2497.151s">We</a> just did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2498.571s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2499.392s">Listen,</a> you'd be the first one to jump down my throat if I made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2503.514s">I'm</a> acknowledging that I made a mistake, and now you're still jumping down my throat.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2509.278s">Who</a> told you? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2511.059s">Because</a> when I came back in and I noticed that Tom Lincoln's paper was being talked about, and I noticed that's at the end of the agenda, I said, we're still in the suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2519.304s">So</a> that's the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2521.445s">So</a> we're going to take a vote.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2561.472s">Then</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2561.832s">You</a> can ask any question on the whole paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2564.653s">The</a> whole paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2565.554s">Then</a> let her come up and answer these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2567.195s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2568.035s">So</a> let's take a vote on the chair first. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2569.716s">Chair</a> for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2571.017s">Do</a> you withdraw your challenge to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2573.119s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2573.699s">Then</a> we have to take a vote on that before we proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2577.582s">It's</a> a ruling. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2578.582s">So</a> we're going to take a vote on the challenge of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2581.924s">The</a> question before the council is if we were under suspension of all the rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2587.214s">or</a> we were not? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2588.234s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2589.075s">Was</a> the paper taken up when the city council was under suspension of the rules? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2592.795s">And</a> we're going to take that vote now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2593.956s">A</a> yes vote says that we were not under suspending all the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2597.157s">A</a> no vote will be that we were under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2599.957s">And</a> we'll move forward either way.

It is, but we want to get public input from businesses and residents before we move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6788.527s">I</a> got to remind people too, not all members of the council could attend this meeting because it wasn't a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6794.628s">We</a> would have been in violation of the open meeting law if more than four members were there talking about a specific issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6801.09s">So</a> in the future, I was advised that by an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6807.471s">We</a> all met on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6812.019s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6812.499s">No,</a> it was where the council actually took action on some of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6816.282s">It</a> could constitute an open meeting law if a quorum is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6819.784s">So</a> in the future, we may want to post this as a public safety meeting or a meeting, and then everyone can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6827.689s">Councilor,</a> your next item.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6854.506s">It's</a> always been on the council agenda, though, when people had the opportunity to come down and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6858.147s">We</a> got a public outcry in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6859.908s">You</a> want to have a committee of the whole or transportation?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6864.689s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Dello Russo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6877.514s">In</a> certain instances, the construction particularly affected the move in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6882.176s">We've</a> moved other ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6883.217s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6883.957s">That</a> was one particular circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6885.898s">So</a> we'll move that to the Committee of the Whole of Transportation, whenever the council sees fit.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6905.255s">And</a> the particular location that's being proposed to, it's actually blocking an egress to a household which is set back behind Pallotta Oil. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6913.799s">So</a> we definitely want to make sure the MBTA is all right with that.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6921.225s">So</a> Committee of the Whole or Transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6922.926s">Committee</a> of the Whole would be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6923.966s">Committee</a> of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6925.507s">The</a> Loading Zone? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6929.648s">Traffic</a> Commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6930.909s">They</a> have to post it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6931.649s">They're</a> the only authority that can do that, the Loading Zone.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6942.993s">Mr.</a> President, if I could mention
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7063.577s">And</a> we'll do it as an official council meeting so that it's publicly advertised and that all members can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7069.538s">Is</a> that OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7070.362s">So</a> I'd like to set that up as a separate B paper, a vote to get that proposal.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7077.688s">So</a> all the amendments, one second, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7080.21s">So,</a> uh, all the amendments referred to the appropriate authorities that Councilor Marks just, um, uh, notated the B paper will be under the jurisdiction of the council to call these meetings in cooperation with the mayor in the pertinent department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7094.441s">That's</a> the B paper, right?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7103.791s">Would</a> you like to send it to a committee or a committee of the whole?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7116.857s">Can</a> I make one recommendation? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7117.957s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7118.397s">We</a> have an intergovernmental affairs committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7121.159s">I</a> think this is a perfect one for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7122.519s">That'd</a> be fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7124.18s">And</a> then report back to the entire council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7125.701s">Is</a> everyone okay with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7128.84s">And</a> that's a B paper.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7201.478s">Hold</a> on one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7206.221s">Why</a> don't you take a seat, and we'll get back to you in one second while he looks it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7208.743s">We're</a> going to take these votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7210.043s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7210.344s">And</a> then we'll. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7211.224s">We'll</a> let her speak.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7214.687s">She</a> wants to speak on water and sewage.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7217.087s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7218.188s">Water</a> and salt. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7218.748s">We'll</a> bring it up if any counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7221.15s">14</a> dash salt. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7222.351s">Any</a> more on the South Medford neighborhood meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7232.579s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7232.78s">Senate,</a> do you have anything else at this point for the South Medford meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7236.142s">And</a> I have to say, Mr. Silva has done more public output on this particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7241.306s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7241.927s">You</a> weren't notified, but in the future it's going to be a public meeting of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7246.581s">which</a> will be publicly advertised, but they're very welcoming if you give them your contact information.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7274.993s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7275.812s">We</a> exchange information. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7276.852s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7277.792s">I'll</a> tell you, I get more emails from him than everyone in the community.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7502.593s">And</a> the only thing this can be used for is something that is directly <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7506.92s">related</a> to the water and the sewer in the community, whether it's improvements, infrastructure improvements, as well as paying the employees that are assigned to that division.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7536.385s">It</a> is the money that is brought in. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7539.707s">The</a> MWRA assesses the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7543.028s">City</a> of Medford then in turn sets the water rates through the Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7547.391s">Any</a> money that comes in after bills are paid, it goes into this account, and right now it's in a positive.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8468.606s">You</a> get that, Councilor Penta?
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8480.373s">I</a> don't know where to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8482.655s">I</a> think you should go back and watch the tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8484.195s">You</a> were talking about the mathematician.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9205.297s">In</a> Massachusetts, I don't think you can charge for water a tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9208.198s">You</a> can't physically call it for the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9212.52s">They</a> can raise your rent, but you cannot charge a tenant for water in the state of Massachusetts.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9367.875s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9369.796s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9372.936s">Motion</a> for approval.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9713.934s">And</a> to do- If I may, just real quick, as the Chair, I think this is going down a slippery slope where it's a political question, so I would just ask Councilors not to <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9724.54s">because</a> this body has sometimes went down this in the past, and...

Oh, I can't do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9792.097s">No,</a> no one can. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9792.718s">This</a> is a government forum, it's not a political forum.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9817.624s">For</a> the issue, not on a ballot question.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9825.222s">I</a> would ask that we table this for one week and get guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9827.263s">This</a> is a political question.

 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=716.142s">Councilor</a> Camuso or Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=717.542s">My</a> light went on.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=905.471s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=907.472s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=908.891s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I applaud Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=912.392s">I</a> think now more than ever, Mr. President, this is something that would be a good addition to the boards and commissions that we have that look at some of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=922.256s">As</a> we know, statutorily, under mass general laws, certain boards and commissions have the statutory obligation to act or not act on these because it falls under their jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=932.76s">With</a> that being said, though, having more citizen input, other than just having them attend the <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=938.522s">regular</a> business meetings of the boards that are tasked with putting some of these into place, I think is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=945.305s">And</a> now more than ever, Mr. President, there's more vehicles on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=949.287s">And</a> quite frankly, I think this may be a good time for the mayor to look at all the boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=954.989s">throughout</a> the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=956.89s">Maybe</a> some of them are not needed anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=959.571s">Maybe</a> new ones are needed, maybe more in technology area or other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=965.793s">So</a> at the same time, if Councilor Marks wouldn't mind, actually make it a B paper because I certainly, I understand the importance of his proposal before us to maybe take a look at all the boards and commissions and see if it's an appropriate time, Mr. President, to either add <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=984.727s">combine</a> or delete some of the commissions or boards based upon, um, uh, just today's day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=992.11s">And</a> we have many fine members that are on these boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=994.511s">And,</a> uh, if the, uh, board is no longer needed, maybe they're willing to serve in another capacity, uh, where their professionalism will be recognized and, uh, help this community move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1003.736s">But,</a> uh, thank you, councilor marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1007.417s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1007.997s">Vice</a> president Dello Russo.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5435.218s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5436.359s">And</a> I certainly agree with Councilor Arena, but I think that this is something that the people that live in this community put the school committee into office to discuss these very important issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5451.49s">And</a> the voters spoke a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5457.016s">on</a> the school committee, and I think that they are the people that are tasked, excuse me, with setting the educational standards and curriculum for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5468.292s">And</a> quite frankly, this issue is way over my head at this point, and Agenda 21, Area 51, I'm not about to take a vote on any of this this evening, because quite frankly, I just, I don't have enough grasp, and it's something that I don't feel comfortable, I don't think it's fair for any councilor to take a vote on anything they don't feel comfortable with at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6544.449s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6545.45s">In</a> the heart of Medford Square, one of the cross signals that indicate for the elderly and seniors and anyone traversing the square is out and should be fixed, especially where it's the heart of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6557.178s">So,</a> move approval.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6820.617s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6821.117s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6821.837s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6822.837s">And</a> I want to just echo the sentiments of Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6826.759s">I</a> had the opportunity a couple days before Thanksgiving, I was invited to speak to the team, myself and some former players. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6835.001s">And</a> it really was just a privilege, Mr. President, because it's not just the winning and losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6840.262s">And</a> as I said to the young men that evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6844.295s">When</a> I was in high school, I had the opportunity to play in hockey and football. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6847.256s">In</a> hockey, we were actually one of the better teams in the GBL and made the tournament every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6852.496s">And</a> in football, we lost just about every game, minus maybe one or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6857.857s">But</a> the camaraderie and the brotherhood and the teamwork, it just developed more on the football field for whatever reason than it did during the winning hockey season, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6868.899s">And</a> like I said to those young men, the city of Medford is proud of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6875.378s">The</a> city of Medford is proud of the hard work and dedication that they've put into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6880.399s">This</a> city is moving forward on a new turf field for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6883.239s">It</a> reminded them that this is the last time they're gonna play a Thanksgiving Day game on grass and moving forward in that basically, Mr. President, they went out there, they left everything they had on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6896.962s">The</a> 16 seniors are moving on and they have nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6904.583s">They</a> worked hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6905.824s">They</a> worked hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6906.444s">As</a> far as the band, that was something I didn't even pick up on, but, uh, Mr, uh, Mr. Councilor is a hundred percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6915.51s">The</a> band is just as big as part of that day as everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6918.852s">So,</a> uh, in the future, I would hope that this doesn't happen.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7246.219s">I</a> would just, I certainly wouldn't be opposed to that, but I would like to see the paper that the school committee approved come before us so that we know what they're at least.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7257.307s">But</a> we don't have the official request for a funding mechanism at this point.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7386.452s">At</a> this point, at least I'm just one member of this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7391.435s">I</a> am going to my stance is waiting for the school committee to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7396.417s">At</a> that point, we can go as citizens, if we'd like, put our input in there, and then we'll officially see the request for funding at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7404.139s">But</a> to try to dictate to the school committee what we feel should be cut out and this and that at this juncture, I just think is going backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7411.302s">But</a> like I said, I'm just one member, and I look forward to the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7417.204s">By</a> the same token, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7418.867s">Any</a> project that ever came, a bond proposal before, Mr. President, whether it was the new schools, whether it was the roof for the schools, whether it was the improvement to the lockers a few years ago, it's always the school committee requesting it from the council what their priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7434.378s">And</a> at that point we can say, hey, we think that the money could be better spent somewhere else.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7440.802s">If</a> that was the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7441.643s">On</a> the motion.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7532.803s">Mr.</a> President, are we going to be talking about the, I believe it's an $8 million proposal or the $2 million proposal that the mayor talked about phase one? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7540.425s">I</a> mean, this is where we're getting, we don't want to give the children of Medford false hopes that we're looking at doing 8 million if the school committee is only going to give us a request for two or three. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7549.986s">So</a> the, as Councilor Penter very eloquently <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7554.233s">alluded</a> to the press release in the mayor's own words. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7556.695s">It</a> was going to be public input, which I believe was done or is about to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7560.378s">There</a> was a meeting either scheduled or scheduled to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7563.421s">And</a> then the mayor went on to say it still needs the approval of the school committee, according to what the councilor just read, and the approval of the city council.
 <p>[Paul Camuso]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7640.374s">And</a> Mr. President, I just have always been a big advocate of the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7645.179s">It</a> has spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7646.52s">They</a> elect the school committee that are ready, willing, and able to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7650.785s">They're</a> the people that are put in the role to make decisions.
