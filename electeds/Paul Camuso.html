    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2295.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Getting used to this Zoom stuff, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2298.841s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2303.453s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, I want to thank Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on, you know, as, as a former athlete at Medford High School, I love to see that we're trying diverse to diversify the athletic programs and the recreational programs in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2320.246s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a few years ago we were very lucky to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2323.208s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: get the recreation department into full swing, you know, and to expand it to include more diverse opportunities for Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2331.176s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just a win-win, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2334.038s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I really think that this is going to take off, you know, you look at the Barchi court, the old Italian Americans love Barchi for the most part, and a lot of other people are now becoming<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2344.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: part of that bocce league at not only the boat club, but also the new bocce courts here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2351.131s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For many, many years, people would go over to the Italian club over in Malden to participate in bocce and to see bocce and now pickleball come to fruition, I think it's a great opportunity for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2362.555s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Furthermore, just on a side note, we have a lot of snowbirds in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2366.557s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The biggest voting blocks and the biggest group in this community, when you look at the numbers, are the senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2373.942s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to give them more opportunity to enjoy their golden years of retirement, I think you have to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2379.305s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I really appreciate you making an effort to put this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2382.587s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On another side note, my mom is a snowbird, as most of you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2386.049s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And down in Naples, they actually have a tournament that brings in thousands upon thousands of people that play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2392.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And they actually set up professional pickleball courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2394.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a big facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2396.195s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And three years ago when I visited my mom, I never even heard of pickleball, but it certainly is something that's taken off, not only here, but down in Florida where the retirees go down and enjoy the nice warm winters that we unfortunately don't have up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2412.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just wanted to go on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2414.219s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I could too, as a former member of the council and a parent of a student in the Medford Public Schools, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2421.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I used to put this on yearly when I was a member of your honorable body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2425.542s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but I think the safety audit of all the parks to make sure, especially now, because once the parks are up and running, I think you're gonna have more people out there this year than ever due to the fact of the COVID-19 situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2437.811s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if you could, somebody think about putting on the agenda or making a paper to have the parks department do the safety audit, just to go through the entire facility structures and check all the nuts and bolts so that we can prevent injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2450.34s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2451.501s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: no win, it's a win-win for the community and we can't go wrong when we're trying to provide safety to the senior citizens and in this particular case, the youth of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2462.046s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So once again, thank you to Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2466.349s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I like when you guys think outside the box, you get down there on Tuesday night and you do the people's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2471.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2473.612s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And on another note,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2475.333s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You guys are showing leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2477.154s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're showing people that the country can still move forward under this devastating vaccine program that's before us now in the COVID situation by showing up on Tuesday nights and getting the people's business done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2489.161s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The continuity of government has to be paramount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2493.323s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the people that are there tonight are doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2494.884s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3182.794s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3185.443s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3188.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thanks again, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3189.986s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just I'd like to make a quick comment on the upcoming elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3193.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We all know that with COVID and the last few election cycles, there's been some movement around the VFW is no longer a polling place, as well as some other minor moves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3205.175s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The temple, excuse me, not the temple, the American Legion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3209.837s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think it's important that you get the message out via all the communication<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3214.901s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3216.564s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Some people received ballots last election that didn't put in for a mail-in ballot like myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3220.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I actually brought that to the attention of the city clerk at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3224.159s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think there has to be a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3226.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: very good PR push to let everybody know what's going on, just because there's so many moving parts with COVID and the secretary of state just filed a bill for mail-in voting to become permanent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3237.231s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So whatever direction it goes in, I just think the public needs to know, because not everybody picks up the Boston Globe and reads the papers and does all their research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3246.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's incumbent upon this city to do that aspect of notifications, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2548.016s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2549.817s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford Mass, here in our fine community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2555.54s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, I want to thank the Honorable Vice President Knight for bringing this up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2560.324s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is an issue that has been championed for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2563.867s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I remember Councilor Marks bringing up this very particular issue when I was a member of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2569.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is an easy fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2571.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This isn't something that has to be long debated like the issue that I appeared on last week, which has, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2578.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: brought up several more issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2580.121s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I've been called from community members regarding Oak Grove Cemetery, for instance, regarding that matter in cleaning up the leaves in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2586.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'll be at the committee of the whole meeting to discuss that, because I know my loved ones are very concerned about the leaves at Oak Grove Cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2592.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is something that can be done easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2595.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the rents down there at Fellsway Plaza are in the area of $30,000 plus a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2600.835s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They have made several beautification projects on that facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2606.111s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but I have to agree with Mr. Poli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2609.252s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The people of Wellington do not deserve to look at that albatross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2612.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I remember last year there was a fire out there right behind that box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2616.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Someone threw a cigarette, the mulch went up and then half of the box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2620.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We need to do what we have to do to maintain our neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2623.638s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The top job as a city councilor is meeting the needs of the constituents in all these neighborhoods throughout the community and the councilors that are sitting there doing just that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2631.781s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I wanna commend you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2634.322s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Furthermore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2636.795s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: on a few other upcoming agenda items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2640.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that it's important to keep doing the people's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2644.7s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, we're showing a continuity in government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2646.641s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People are down there doing the people's business week after week, and it doesn't go unnoticed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2650.903s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just wanna tell you, councilors, this pandemic is slowing a lot of things down, but the Medford City Council is still meeting at City Hall on Tuesday nights, getting the job done that you're voted in there to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2661.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I wanna commend all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2663.45s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you very much for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3109.641s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3110.822s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, once again, 114 Lincoln Road here in our fine community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3115.927s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3119.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is a very unique opportunity for the city of Medford to bring in new non-tax revenue, which is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3126.598s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is the revenues that we should be going after, not trying to take more money out of people's pockets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3132.323s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that might be living on fixed incomes and other things throughout this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3136.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this is a unique opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3138.369s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have to try to maximize and hold the people that wanna come in accountable to benefit this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3146.236s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I would have liked to seen this done over the last two or three years before other communities had this off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3152.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For whatever reason, it stalled under the past city solicitor, but I'm glad you guys got it to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3157.947s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: point where we're at today, working with the administration, and I think you have to bring in value with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3163.97s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's going to be a good opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3166.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's overwhelmingly been supported by the voters in our community, so it's a good source of new non-tax revenue to bring in that can do many good things in this community under the leadership of the mayor's office and this honorable body by putting the money to good use where you see fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3184.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's get going and get out there and bring home the bacon as they say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3189.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thanks guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7585.195s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hi, my name is Paul Canuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7589.756s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, good evening to the Honorable City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7593.657s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd just like to go on record, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7597.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7598.958s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We hear a lot lately of looking for additional ways to raise revenues and whether it's going to be a proposition two and a half or a debt exclusion by certain members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7610.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm all for things to make our city better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7613.062s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But what I'm not for is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7615.682s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, there's, this is a, this is, this as a proposed, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, it's going to be an additional tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7624.67s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I talked to my landscaper who does about 25 houses on our street, and they're talking about an extra a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars per household, because if they have to use rakes and not the proper equipment to do the job, then they're not going to be able to do it for the same price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7640.163s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I'd rather see our money go towards the schools, go towards the fire department, the police department, and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7647.348s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With all due respect, I think that this is an overshot of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7651.912s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that this is going to put a burden on people that take their homes and their beautiful homes and try to make them better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7658.657s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, if the landscape prices keep going up, you're going to see people not getting it done because it's unaffordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7665.602s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I don't want to see that happen in my community that I love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7668.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this is an overstep of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7670.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I really believe that we should take a step back and really look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7674.97s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you drive by homes in this community, people can't maintain the properties as they are in some occasions, and it's not fair to the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7682.714s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I just wanted to go on record in absolutely opposing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7687.817s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think you're gonna hear from a lot of the landscapers in the community, the DPW, and Michael Marks, you're right on target, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7693.84s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: How can you say that the city can do them next to Morrison Park, Placestead Park, and other parks, but you can't have your home cleaned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7700.643s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't make sense, Mr. President, but I just wanted to go on record and be against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7705.406s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you for taking the time to listen to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13005.509s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13007.73s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know it's been a long evening for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13010.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13014.273s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But thank you for calling on me, Mr. President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13019.015s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I speak from my experience as a member of the school committee and as a city councilor for about 16 years here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13028.36s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, the budget that we received, I want to thank the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13031.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Read it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13033.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's got a lot of information, a total overhaul of budgets of years past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13039.867s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm glad that it was presented in the format that it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13043.551s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a great collaboration from all the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13047.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The narratives were great and the charts and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13051.177s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But as far as the discussion that's going on regarding meeting in Zoom and meeting in the council chambers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13061.04s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I absolutely understand that there is a lot of value in meeting at the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13067.445s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, yeah, when you have to look people in the eye on tough debates and things of that nature, and quite honestly, after watching this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13077.159s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and some other meetings that are on Zoom, the decorum, the Robert's Rules of Order are in place for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13083.341s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's a lot easier to keep an orderly meeting, I think, if you're at a public meeting rather than on Zoom, just because the technology is a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13094.385s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, I do not envy any of you guys during this COVID time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13099.107s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This city has stepped up amazingly, the city council, the mayor's office, the school department, everybody, to meet the needs of the people in our community with this COVID-19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13108.75s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's unprecedented, as we all know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13112.071s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think that somewhere along the line, and I really got to credit the entire council tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13119.415s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for the motion that was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13120.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe it's basically for like a mediation with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13123.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if that's the correct word to use, but Marianne O'Connor, who I've had the privilege of knowing over the years, she is a consummate professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13131.142s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and as well as the members of the school committee, the council, the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13135.764s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If there's a way to do a hybrid model, I think it would be the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13139.906s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just because of the fact, like you said, people can have both, you can come down there if your health allows you to, and you can also participate on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13149.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The one good thing that I am encouraged by this evening is the participation, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13155.712s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The name calling and stuff that was allowed to happen tonight on all sides of this issue, it's not Medford that we can be proud of, to be quite frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13164.535s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We should all be working together to move Medford forward in a way that we all love Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13169.917s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whether you've been here for a hundred years or you've been here for a hundred days, it doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13173.978s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You moved here because you like something in this community and it can always be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13178.052s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It can always be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13180.193s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I suggest, like I said, I hope tomorrow Vice President Caraviello, President Falco, with the mayor and other people can sit down and let cooler heads prevail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13190.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One thing that has been frustrating on Zoom, just when I've watched it, is sometimes they have to call the roll three, four, five times to find out how people are voting and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13200.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The technology is iffy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13202.904s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13204.714s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand that it's a good tool, but at the same token, it's something that can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13210.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: whether it's a slow internet connection on a specific night or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13214.416s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, it does, does can get challenging, you know, but, uh, for our community, for the Medford that we all love, let cooler heads prevail and, uh, let's get the budget and do it, uh, do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13226.426s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I, and I just would like to, uh, hopefully it's a hybrid if we can do it in a safe manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13230.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, as far as both sides of the issue, I understand, I understand both sides of the issue, but I cannot state loud enough the value of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13240.135s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: having a meeting with people once it's safe to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13244.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would encourage you, would strongly encourage you guys to try to do some sort of hybrid model, because this might be another year before we're out of the woods with COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13255.609s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The numbers are going up and down as we see all over the country right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13259.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't know where we're gonna be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13261.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The city has done a tremendous job getting the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13265.59s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the PPE out there and things of that nature, working with the partners in federal and state government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13270.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But we don't know where we're going down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13272.512s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So people's individual needs can be met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13275.273s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I've always been a big person for meeting the individual needs of constituents as we all are when we're elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13282.434s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if we have both, I think it would be the best because I think the decorum, most importantly, would be brought back to a place that we can all be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13293.325s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in a setting less virtual, but also virtual for the people that do have health needs that may need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13300.171s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's all I have tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13302.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And once again, just good luck with this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13304.675s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Budget time is never easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13306.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Back in early 2000, I was around when there was a serious budget crisis when you were on the school committee council, Falco, and we worked together and we did some unique things to make sure that we mitigated some of the funds that weren't there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13321.987s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we did that by working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13324.128s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We didn't do that by the school committee and the council, not seeing eye to eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13327.129s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We did that by working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13328.982s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we were able to put out a product that was good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13331.383s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13333.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I miss all you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13335.285s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And have a good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=449.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: City.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3041.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3042.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good evening, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3043.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3047.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it sort of seems like deja vu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3049.951s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3053.612s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department, this is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3062.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3069.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3081.305s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: By laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks, I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3090.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, week after week, we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3097.188s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3101.449s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the former councilor just referred to the salaries that city councilors are paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3107.55s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3112.324s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The collections this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3113.806s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3117.071s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a lot of money out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3118.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's over $9 million in certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3121.216s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This community is stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3122.939s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This community is thriving, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3126.702s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think it's about time that you take a hard vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3129.583s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3132.483s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You spend the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3133.404s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Give the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3139.505s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3145.646s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3151.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And some of those are outdated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3152.068s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct, Chief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3153.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3154.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3163.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3174.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3186.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3190.742s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3198.605s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And very easily that could have came north on Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3202.987s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Chief Gilberti could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning and we could have had it going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3210.05s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women and also to the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3216.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3220.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Go up the cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3221.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a thriving cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3222.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3229.779s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Councilor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3234.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that that's been on the plate up there, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3239.045s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3242.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think if you wait one week, I think it's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3247.412s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And here's the other thing, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3248.973s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We heard the young lady over here and the Commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3258.66s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There has been price quotations that have been sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3261.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3267.197s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said, let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3277.806s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and financing equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3283.571s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he was very, very good at his job doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3286.533s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But here we are this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3289.883s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3299.029s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: preferred, the preferred method, as far as the council was doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3303.151s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just want to say, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3312.276s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3315.558s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's great being down here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3317.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3440.339s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3108.97s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3109.911s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good evening, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3111.212s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3114.675s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it sort of seems like deja vu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3116.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3118.818s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3121.22s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3124.761s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3129.985s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3136.749s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3148.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: By laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3152.577s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3157.858s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, week after week we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3164.84s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3169.101s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the former councillor just referred to the salaries that city councillors are paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3175.202s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3179.979s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The collections this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3181.441s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3184.726s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a lot of money out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3186.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's over $9 million in certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3188.871s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This community is stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3190.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This community is thriving, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3194.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think it's about time that you take a hard vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3197.201s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3200.101s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You spend the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3201.022s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Give the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3207.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3213.244s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3218.606s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And some of those are outdated, correct, Chief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3221.134s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3222.215s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3231.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3242.408s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3254.016s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown, in Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers, and very easily that could have came north on Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3270.601s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Chief Gilbert, he could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning, and we could have had it going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3277.647s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women, and also to the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3283.652s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3287.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Go up the cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3288.833s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a thriving cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3290.394s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3297.356s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Councilor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3302.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that that's been on the plate up there, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3306.619s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3309.6s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think if you wait one week, I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3311.992s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3314.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And here's the other thing, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3316.555s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We heard the young lady over here and the commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3326.242s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There has been price quotations that have been sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3329.364s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3334.807s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3342.252s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3345.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and, and, and, um, and financing equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3351.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he was very, very good at his job, uh, doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3354.123s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, uh, here we are this evening and, uh, we're looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always preferred, the preferred method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3368.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: as far as the council was doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3370.732s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, I just want to say, uh, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3379.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, uh, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3383.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, it's great being down here this evening and thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2376.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2377.887s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good evening, Mr. President, uh, members of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2380.47s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My name is Paul Camuso, a resident of one 14 Lincoln road in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2385.916s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you this evening on this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2391.102s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, as we all know, we've seen an increase in air traffic over our community and uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2397.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My personal opinions, being this close to Boston, we're going to see things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2402.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's what makes us one of the components of making a great community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2406.296s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's having the proximity to Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2409.377s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that comes the responsibility of our elected officials to advocate on behalf of our residents to make sure that we can do the best that we can as far as mitigating circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2421.821s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The interesting part of this conversation, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2424.978s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Currently, runway 15 right at Logan Airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2428.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're looking to, as the gentleman said, to possibly divert more of the traffic to 15 right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2435.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For those of you that don't realize it, 15 right is the landing path when it comes over like Winchester, right over the Lawrence Memorial Hospital in the Lawrence Estates, and then over the lower part of the Fulton Heights in Wellington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2450.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and that will certainly increase if, um, if the changes go through, uh, I'd be remissed if I don't thank, um, the mayor as well as the city council for, um, for making sure that we have a seat at the table next week, um, at these very important meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2467.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think the, uh, the FAA, uh, they're more worried about safety and things of that magnitude rather than noise complaints because at the end of the day, uh, safety is their paramount, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2479.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: uh, thoughts and feelings when it comes to, um, these type of decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2483.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I'm learning a lot more about the air traffic patterns and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2486.915s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My brother is a commercial pilot for a major airline that flies out of Logan airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2491.317s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um, and, uh, like he was explaining to me, certain winds and stuff dictate the runway takes off and takeoffs and landings, uh, as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2500.442s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's not just saying we're going to bury Medford with all the noise and give Milton a break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2504.624s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It all depends on some, uh, extenuating circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2507.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As someone that does like to fly to go on vacation, I would rather take the safest route out of the airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2516.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: given the nature of being in an aircraft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2519.354s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, it's common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2521.175s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just wanted to get up here and thank the Mayor, Mayor Burke, as well as the City Council on this particular matter, because I think one of the best things that we have going for us is voices of reason sitting at the table and discussing topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2537.961s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The other thing I know that should be a priority of people is if we're going to get more air traffic over our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2545.28s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We should be entitled to more funding to put additional measures in people's homes, similar to Winthrop, similar to East Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2554.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I know that that's another important piece of the puzzle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2558.269s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just think it's very important that we look at this as a safety issue and as well as an issue of quality of life at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2568.776s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One should not trump the other, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2571.399s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but I'm just a one of many citizens in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2574.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this distinguished body this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2579.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I look forward to seeing how this goes along and the next coming months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2584.364s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3042.068s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Once again, Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, here in our lovely community of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3048.334s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3049.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just would like to get up and thank this city council, as well as Mayor Burke and the DPW, the safety improvements at the Brooks School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3057.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as many of you are aware, my son is a second grader at the Brooks School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3066.903s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When you look at just those minor changes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3070.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It certainly changed the whole traffic patterns down there, not as far as cut-throughs and all that, but as far as people traversing Route 60, those lights are incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3080.85s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3081.39s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to see them go up so quickly is a testament to our local government working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3087.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was just, it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3088.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know there's more long-term<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3090.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: planning that's going on in that particular area through West Medford Square and the like, but in the immediate, the immediate changes have gone over very, very big with the parents and it's certainly given us a safer environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3105.253s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just wanted to get up and thank you all as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=63.115s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=64.516s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it is a pleasure to be here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=67.615s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, early on after the mayor was elected, she put together these teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=71.797s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And right off the bat, she was adamant that we make sure that we include all different areas of this community, as well as the different demographics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=81.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think that based upon the meetings that we had, the survey that was put out and completed by over 300 residents, as well as the public meetings, I think we accomplished that task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=96.088s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The report that the mayor is going to highlight I think is inclusive of many areas where the city as well as the different department heads can improve as well as a focus on making sure that we're here to have the needs of each and every constituent met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=113.251s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to once again thank the mayor and look forward to working with her administration as we move this city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=120.172s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's been an honor to serve with my fellow members here and once again thank you Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3109.569s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3125.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3127.06s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I don't even know where to begin, you know, uh, 36 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3133.763s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I was two years older than Councilor Lungo, you know, and, uh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3141.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3143.745s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For the first time, I'm speechless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3145.026s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, Bob, you're really a fellow that's kept me young over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3149.908s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Sometimes you'd think that we were two kids getting ready to fight at Playstead Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3154.491s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But in reality, we were both just fighting for what we really believed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3159.454s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's something that I admire about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3163.816s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going out this evening, retiring as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3166.698s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the council's not going to be the same without you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3171.673s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I respect your loyalty, your tenacious ability to fight for what you believe in, and you've certainly been passionate over your tenure on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3182.719s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One thing that I really admired about you, and I was going through a similar situation at the time with my dad, was when you cared for your lovely wife, Linda, and I saw a side of you that most people didn't see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3199.109s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm just talking about my dad, I get a little emotional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3203.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you really are a good-hearted guy, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3206.151s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At the end of the day, and the good part about it was, I'd see you at Bocelli's or something, after a meeting, you'd still tell me how much I stink, but we could laugh about it, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3218.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, like I said, I'm going out tonight, we're both going out as winners, we both won by fighting for the people of Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3230.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: didn't want to make it sound, I'm in good company of leaving this room tonight with another councillor that I know left his best battle on the field and you fought for what you believed in and for that you should be very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5064.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5065.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was a very nice send-off, nice speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5070.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I grew up in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5073.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As you all know, basically the only two mayors that I remember are Mayor Parikh and Mayor McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5081.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5083.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Still a little emotional, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5087.767s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: During my last 16 years as a member of the city council, you know, I had some of the best times of my life, but also some of the toughest times of my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5098.355s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, a few people upstairs right now looking down that I know are proud of me are my dad, that many of you knew, Al, and my grandmother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5110.263s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I remember the, uh, the parties, the election night parties at my grandmother's house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5116.467s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, we had some fun, you know, but, uh, you know, also in 2006, I married my best friend, Janine, you know, Janine, thank you for being there for me because as, um, as Susan knows, and the rest of the spouses of the, uh, Councilors, this is a full-time job, you know, and, uh, I, I, I had the, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5140.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the, the word I'm looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5145.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5147.269s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I saw that I was spending too much time actually doing this job and not enough time where it actually was important on occasion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5155.131s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5156.832s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because this job does take a toll upon you and more your loved ones than you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5162.914s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd be here fighting with my friend, and I'd be getting calls at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5167.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got good supporters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5168.056s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They'd call and yell at my poor wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5171.377s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you know the stuff that goes along with this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5175.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And for that, I'm forever grateful, honey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5178.301s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've been there through some of my biggest struggles in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5182.464s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you're the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5183.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I love you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5192.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Moving ahead a little bit, a couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5195.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Next best, well, they're equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5198.918s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Best thing in my life is that little guy sitting in row number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5202.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Little Jimmy, stand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5204.122s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Stand up, buddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5212.547s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Bob said, this is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5214.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5214.929s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm really looking forward to just getting grounded again and getting back into some sort of sense of normalcy of not being out on, it's not just Tuesday nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5226.687s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's many a nights and you know the constituent service part, we have people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5231.431s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm only as good as the people that have supported me and got me to where I needed to be at first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5235.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And a few people that I want to acknowledge from my family is my brother John and my brother Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5249.998s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I was very lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5251.218s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I got great in-laws and, and, uh, they do more babysitting for me to get out and to do the constituent stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5258.341s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, and, and, uh, you know, you're going to get a little more free time on your hands now too, Jeannie and Frank, cause I'll be home a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5264.864s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, so thank you for all that you've, uh, done for me and my family, um, over the years and also my brother-in-law Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5272.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, um, you know, my original committee, they're mostly here tonight when I decided to run for office in 1999.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5280.593s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I gathered the people that were just closest to me and near and dear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5285.314s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's my aunt, my campaign manager, Carol Regan, who's right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5289.616s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, auntie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5295.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Another person who's well known in this community from Medford Youth Hockey and just a real great person is Len Galeona, who's right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5308.747s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Also, someone that is on the DPW, I don't know if he's still here, but Mike Nesta, another original.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5315.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One of the original guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5319.023s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And also my pal, Jason, you know, right from the very beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5322.924s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My buddy, Jason Traviglione, he was there right from the beginning with several of my other cousins, Tommy, Terry, Tony, Johnny, Joey, and Artie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5331.988s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, we hit the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5332.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'll tell you a funny story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5334.349s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You talk about walking the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5336.209s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll never forget it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5337.09s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was one of your neighbors on Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5339.351s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're passing out the first literature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5341.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Guy calls me over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5342.312s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I like the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5342.872s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It looks good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5343.652s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you spelt commitment wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5345.553s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5346.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got to be kidding me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5347.557s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So instead of passing out literature, we're running back up the hill trying to take the literature back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5352.7s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And of course, like any good politician, you tell a little fib.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5357.083s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I blame the printer, but it was really my fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5362.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A few City Hall department heads that have really been there for me over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5365.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's Roy Belson from the schools, Mark Rumley, who's in the room in the back there, as well as the past president of the Medford City Council, Bob Mayorko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5375.484s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the people that were just very helpful over the years in giving me guidance, and I want to thank them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5383.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, 16 years is a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5386.552s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I went back and just was plugging in the years on the computer, because I knew I had to speak tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5391.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It seems, uh, it was in 2000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5393.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's when, uh, the big race between Al Gore and George Bush, when we didn't know who the president was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5400.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That seems like many, many, many years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5402.963s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A few years later or the next year we had September 11th, you know, and, um, there was also the good things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5410.969s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I was an elected official, I was able to stand here and get my picture taken with the world series trophy, a Patriots trophy, and also a Bruins trophy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5419.336s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, that's, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5421.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That just tells you how long 16 years is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5423.807s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And 16 years is a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5425.289s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I couldn't do it, 38.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5426.99s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, sirree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5430.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, as far as the councillors, I mentioned Bob Mayorko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5432.895s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Other two councillors that I served with when I first got on, it was Councilor Bill Carr, who Bill was just another good guy, and Councilor Macarena, who I served with for a short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5443.024s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just want to thank them, because I know how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5447.37s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: how this is sometimes on your family life and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5450.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it doesn't go unnoticed, the sacrifice that all the councilors here have made over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5457.512s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Michael Marks, you know, when we first started out, Michael Marks and myself, we were close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5463.813s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We were in that first little block of four who made Stephanie Muccini-Burke the president of the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5470.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we drifted apart over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5472.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Michael, you're a stalwart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5474.116s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're a good kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5477.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got a good career ahead of you, and it's been a pleasure to serve with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5480.422s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he said he's going to be on that side, so you ain't getting home early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5487.826s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Ricky, what else can I say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5489.047s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As you said, you used to drive us to Austin Prep with Ricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5492.709s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We'd be driving up to Austin Prep in the morning, and like screwballs, we'd put our hand out the window when it was 30 degrees so we could keep the hand outside the window longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5500.294s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just stupid, stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5503.536s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you'd be yelling at us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5506.009s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm freezing in here, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5508.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you're just a great, great guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5510.572s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And your wife, Carol, who certainly is also a big champion behind you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5517.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Fred Dello Russo, when I first ran, I didn't know if I was running for the Medford City Council or running against Fred Dello Russo, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5523.952s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Everybody in this city made it a Camuso-Dello Russo race when Freddy first ran for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5529.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sure some of you remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5531.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so as Fred stated, it was a rocky start, but you know something, Fred?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5537.022s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Me and you became best pals here, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5541.244s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This guy right here, he's there for people in their time of need, but he's also been there for me, uh, as a fellow city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5547.988s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, and on occasion when I get ramped up, he'd tell me, Hey, calm down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5553.851s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd listen to him sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5555.442s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Other times there was no stopping the kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5558.243s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Fred, you know, I really value our friendship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5561.524s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know we're going to be lifelong friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5563.565s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And your dad also was there for me when I first ran for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5567.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just you come from an outstanding family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5569.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you for being my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5574.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Adam, thank God for that English test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5579.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, Adam, uh, Adam and I have been friends for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5583.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, Adam was there for me early on in my campaigns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5586.377s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, I just wish I had more time to serve with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5589.118s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, um, as I stated a little earlier, I just, uh, I'm looking forward to a little time off and, um, and having a nine to five, uh, day rather than, um, I will stay up, watch about half the city council meetings, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5602.143s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, uh, but, uh, Adam, you're, you're just a great person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5606.196s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn, you know, went to Medford High School with Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5612.58s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just, you're just a good kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5615.863s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You also fight, I call them kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5617.544s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm only a year older than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5619.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're just a great person, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5621.506s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I've watched you over the years become a good councilor, but also a mom of three children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5629.8s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I find it tough with one child being a councillor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5632.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you really are just, you're a stalwart, and you get out, and you really work hard, and I want to thank you for your friendship over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5642.971s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Bob, I've already said it, you're a good guy, and I'm going to miss our fights, because to be honest with you, I'm going to be honest with you, and if he wasn't there and I wasn't there, the meetings would be boring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5657.043s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Fair to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5665.275s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, a few other people that I'd just like to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5669.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to congratulate and thank is right over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5672.351s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These two young fellas over here, George Scarpelli and John Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5676.933s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that Bob and I leave this evening, and we're leaving it in good hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5681.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are two guys that are coming from the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5683.636s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They understand the complexity of issues, and it's not always a quick, easy fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5687.958s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Councilor Dello Russo stated a little earlier, the legislative process sometimes moves a little bit slower than people would like, but at the end of the day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5699.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This city's in good hands with the people coming on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5703.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Being that person that just drives the DPW crazy over the years, I saved the best for last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5710.373s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The DPW, people don't realize the work that they do on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5715.874s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're not only dealing with the stuff when they get in in the morning that they have the long list of stuff, but they're dealing with seven city councillors calling them, they're dealing with residents calling them, they're dealing with the mayor's office calling them, they're dealing with just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5726.818s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They stop to get a cup of coffee and people are yelling and screaming, and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5731.044s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, people don't realize that the snow plowing, they think that after the DPW plows the snow away from their driveway, that they just come by to get a chuckle and put it back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5740.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5741.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5743.881s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a job that you do very, very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5747.943s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Steve Tanagli is in the back of the room, and he works as well with Mike Nestor and Paul Gere, who's our current commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5755.206s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you guys for meeting my individual needs, because I have always taken this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5761.769s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the big issues are going to be debated here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5764.21s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the one by one is how you build friendships, relationships, and how you build bonds that you'll have forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5773.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor mocks Carol Bailey who was one of my closest friends over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5777.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I met her her son is in college now He's ready to graduate and I met her when Michael mocks called me because she had one of those funky streets in West Medford Hercroft Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5786.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was the year Michael left the school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5789.512s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Half of the street went to the Gleason School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5791.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you live right next door, you went to the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5795.116s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And through Councilor Marks, I was able to build a bond by helping out Carol and her son remain at the Gleason School or get into the Gleason School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5803.001s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And one by one, that's how you build a good group, a good following behind you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5809.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just can't say enough about the DPW because they're great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5815.79s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we can get a hand for those guys because they really are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5826.344s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The last two people I just want to acknowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5831.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I've got the wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5834.647s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You'll laugh, I've got to make sure, because I'll never hear the end of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5839.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The last two people I'd like to acknowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5841.69s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's one other person that's retiring at the end of this year with Councilor Bob and myself, and that's Mayor Mike McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5849.213s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People seem to think that I've just got this rosy, great relationship with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5853.615s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People don't realize how much we battle behind the closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5856.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, you know, and even Councilor Pente, I think you'd say the same about Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5862.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you can battle and battle, but he always tried to do what's right for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5867.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's been a great mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5868.776s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5869.297s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If he wasn't doing something right, he wouldn't be the mayor overwhelmingly for 28 consecutive years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5874.638s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So when you keep that into perspective, the man is retiring, the man's going to spend more time with his family, but I personally want to thank him for his years of service and the invaluable things he taught me over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5889.061s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So Mike McGlynn, good luck in your retirement as well if you're out there watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5892.662s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, it's sort of like some of those old TV shows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5895.104s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No one watches, but everyone knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5897.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He still says he never watches it, but I think he's full of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5899.828s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think he watches the council meetings, and he just says that, oh, I heard of this or that, but I think he's watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5905.633s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if you are watching, Mr. Mayor, you've done a hell of a job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5908.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's been a good ride, and best of luck to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5918.041s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The next individual and in the last individual that I just want to recognize this evening, you know There was a race for mayor in this community the first time in 28 years and that's a long time 28 years it was former mayor Parika And then it was mayor Mike McGlynn for 28 years and in the new mayor-elect, you know as I stated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5942.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mayor-elect Burke has been a former member of this Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5947.185s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you know, I hope that I'm saying this, but you know, people say, well, when she went to the mayor's office, she didn't do this or wasn't responsive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5958.287s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5959.187s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People got to understand, she worked for another individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5962.468s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She worked for another individual that called all the shots in that office, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5966.965s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I really think that this city is in good hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5970.248s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Councilor Penta said, there wasn't a mandate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5972.71s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was a very close election, but the people have spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5975.553s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think this is the time that we all have to get behind the new administration and work to make Medford a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5981.258s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5982.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She's in a position now where she can make things happen and not being the director of budget and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5987.883s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um, and for that, and last but not least, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5991.222s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: During this campaign, I was able to spend a lot of time with her and her family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5995.526s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just got to see a side of them that I necessarily didn't over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5999.869s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And other than my dad, my dad always loved her as a Councilor because she was sharp and she didn't speak all the time on every issue, but she knew the vote she was taking and was very smart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6011.579s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I relied upon my dad's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6018.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: thoughts over the years, and Stephanie Burke, you're gonna be a hell of a mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6023.604s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know you got big shoes to fill, but you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6026.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You surround yourself with good people, be open-minded, and just always doing the right thing, and this community's going to prosper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6034.735s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And for anyone out there that may think differently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6038.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Give her a shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6038.959s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's always two years from now, you can take a look or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6041.983s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I have the utmost faith in knowing her brains, her intelligence, and her compassion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6048.05s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because in this job as mayor, you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6051.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6052.245s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I admire the both candidates for mayor, because early on in the race, there were some things that made me ponder and say, I'm glad I didn't run for mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6060.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that was when you had to make major personnel decisions based upon actions of people that may have did something within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6067.34s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The mayor's office is a job that you're actually the CEO of a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6072.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're saying people may not have a job tomorrow based upon some of their actions or based upon circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6080.888s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so you need to be, you need to have a lot of different characteristics for that job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6087.112s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Stephanie, I look forward to, and the mayor-elect is here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6091.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you could please just take a bow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6103.789s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just want to thank everyone for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6109.392s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know she texted me 30 times before, because I had to go get flowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6113.634s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'd like my son and my wife to come up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6116.135s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I got little flowers for you, Whole Foods, but Dorico McGlynn was closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6165.471s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6166.412s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hey, go ahead, ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6167.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What did you just ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6168.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want you to know what I got him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6174.038s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, two more days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6174.838s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Santa's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6175.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But on an all serious note, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6178.621s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This has been a hell of a ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6180.262s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just want to thank everyone for coming here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6184.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for me just because this is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6187.256s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you look around this room and there's 150 years worth of family and everything else, right James?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6194.523s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So God bless everyone and Merry Christmas and good luck to the new city council, the new school committee and the new mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6201.51s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's move this city in the right direction and I'll be on the sidelines watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6233.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6236.112s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: After I got here and I put the people that helped me get here, it's the citizens of Medford, it's the citizens of Medford that I owe a big thank you to because without them, none of this would have been possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6247.361s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So thank you Medford and good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8924.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8925.57s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We say there was a flood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8927.031s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If so, what teachers were not reimbursed and where was this flood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8931.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In a flood at the Roberts and a flood at the McGlynn over the last two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8934.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8935.276s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do the teachers have not been reimbursed for their own personal money putting out there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8940.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, we should want to look into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8943.319s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can the council at least give us the names after so we can get the superintendent to look at this as soon as possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8950.083s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You don't want to say it on the floor, though, because obviously you don't want to throw the teachers out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8955.226s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: How many teachers in total on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8960.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when was this flood recently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8969.392s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The better question, too, is, I think, how is the building flooding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8973.394s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Pipes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8973.874s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think the pipes are breaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8975.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, if we could get the teachers' names and find out where the reimbursement is and for what type of things they're looking to get reimbursed on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8982.999s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because obviously, if they're coming out of pocket for this stuff as a result of a maintenance issue, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9440.44s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd just like to explain my next vote before it's called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9443.563s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to support the amendment on the discretionary funding, but on the main motion, I believe that's a school committee issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9450.13s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The money was appropriated as an aggregate amount for the Medford school committee to spend under their wise, um, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9458.643s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: vote or not so wise vote, whatever it was, but it was a budget that was passed in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9462.966s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, I'm going to leave this as a school committee may issue similar to what the young lady stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9468.309s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I will be voting no on that, but the discretionary funding I'm going to vote yes on because that's a funding that we have not seen at any point where the mayor it's mitigation or from his golf tournament or it's from some other funding source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9682.884s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Another great successful Medford High School graduate story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9686.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could send him a letter of congratulations on behalf of this honorable body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10020.918s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10021.118s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10022.019s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This will probably be my last speech at the city council, but who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10027.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10028.203s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We get a few minutes left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10030.585s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Certainly this is a good one to end on as a method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10032.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: City council, Dom Camara is just a gentleman and um, served the citizens of Medford as a school teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10040.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with dignity over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10042.477s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And rather than retire, he took on another role post-retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10047.6s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to wish him well and thank him for his years of service as a commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10052.323s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Councilor Mark stated, it's a job that you go into the meeting and you get yelled at and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10057.907s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a thankless job, but a lot of work went into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1530.383s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1532.864s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Comcast Open Voice, that was actually—it wasn't public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1536.844s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was more a website initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1540.435s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that Comcast did, so we were one of either four or five, like Councilor Marks indicated, cities throughout the nation that did receive that grant or funding for it, but it was more towards webpage development and have the interaction through the web, not on public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1557.744s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I certainly think that the new administration going forward is going to, if anyone's going to get it up and running, it's going to be the new administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1566.503s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to come in here, I'm assuming, and they're going to want to get things done in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1571.164s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And public access hasn't been on the air for quite some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1575.766s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This city council is well on record on trying to shut down public access over the years with the TV3 gang by a myriad of votes that took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1587.249s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I certainly am in support of Councilor Penta's motion to get a public access station up and running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1595.632s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1596.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was a few months ago that I joked with Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1600.129s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I plan on having you on my cooking show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1602.45s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you actually said you'd come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1604.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm going to have a show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1606.232s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When it's up and running, it's going to be a cooking show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1608.192s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm going to have you on, and the two of us are going to break bread together, and we're going to make a nice Italian dish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3057.689s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3059.07s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just, I'd be remissed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3060.57s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're talking about public access and the holiday season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3063.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, um, I just want to thank the individual out there that sent a real nice, um, obscene Christmas card to the Camuso family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3072.855s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's someone that, uh, I believe based upon the investigation that's ongoing in handwriting that's been submitted to the Medford city council on petitions over the years that law enforcement, um, utilizing the federal mail service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3085.599s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I think there's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3089.27s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sure everyone will hear about it in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3091.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to that person that sent a card with threats in it, as well as swears, and when my six-year-old opened it up that's just learning how to read, I would just like to thank that individual, because when you screw around with the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3107.321s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: mail, it's not something that people take lightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3111.844s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to that person, I just want to wish them a very happy holiday season, and I'm sure we'll be seeing them very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3117.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in the proper place, so Merry Christmas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4216.232s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4217.312s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd just like to send our very sorrowful condolences to the family of Joan Sacco-Sullivan, who passed away this morning after a short<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4227.235s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but a very aggressive battle with pancreatic cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4231.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the pleasure of knowing Mrs. Sullivan since I was a little boy, growing up with her son, Greg, in West Medford, and just a real good family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4239.14s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She's got wonderful children, and she'll be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4243.402s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, she was a school secretary for probably over 35 years, still assigned to the Columbus School up until the time she got sick, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4255.425s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: just want to send her family our condolences and Thank them for her years of service to the children of this community in her 30 plus years with the method public schools Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4283.722s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4292.187s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4293.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to just say thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4296.429s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not going to put in an official resolve, but a thank you to Teamsters Local 25 and President Sean O'Brien and Vice President Stephen Self.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4305.435s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just this last week, a Medford family that is less fortunate received an entire van full of toys<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4313.705s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: by the Teamsters Local 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4315.687s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could just send them a thanks, it's one of the many charitable events that they run each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4320.87s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could send that to them on behalf of the Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2783.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They also have to be subdivided within a condo association which has to be recorded prior to doing anything in the building department because there's so many standards as far as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2794.186s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: water meters and everything else, common areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2800.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Knight had a paper around a month ago to address this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2892.689s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2895.03s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mortgage companies are not going to give you a mortgage either, unless it's a deeded property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3029.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Move the question and the floor passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3639.98s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thanks, Ian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5125.525s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That certainly is the will of the mayor if he has the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5129.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is asking for a vote to ask him to bring the million dollars according to municipal finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5136.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's the only way that a money paper can be initiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5139.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's with the official mayor bringing it forward to the legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5144.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So let's just take the vote on hers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5146.52s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whatever, if it fails, if it passes, and we move forward on the rest of the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5149.983s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5152.284s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5201.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Move to four questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5587.856s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're still talking about that million dollars that the council took a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5600.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Half of what Councilor Lungo proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5601.858s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You double it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5602.719s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, a little bit more, 2.4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5603.499s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is all semantics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5607.459s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We just took a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6020.725s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion to vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8102.37s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8104.011s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unfortunately, this has been a nice meeting, I thought, and I still do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8111.172s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I'm not going to sit here and just let the Medford resident be bashed, to be quite frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8117.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're all entitled to our opinion, as Councilor Penta said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8120.754s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A campaign took place for several offices in the community, and nobody knows what happened in this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8126.755s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8128.075s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But what happened last week during a congratulatory citation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8135.961s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When family members, young kids that happen to maybe be watching this, it was classless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8142.186s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was absolutely classless, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8144.968s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I understand the frustrations possibly, but this is right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8149.231s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When the same counsellor talked about a freshman captain on the girls hockey team and berated her and said that she, the girls didn't even want her to be captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8159.539s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the mother came storming down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8163.248s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's classless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8164.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's classless, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8166.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't know what happened in that particular matter, nor will anyone that was other than the people that were in that room may not know what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8172.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I agree with the Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8174.801s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can all put any resolutions on and this and that and thank people, but last week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8180.592s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: when it was a resolution of just to say congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8183.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's resolutions that every single member of this council have put on over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8188.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe it was congratulating someone that was convicted of a crime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8191.677s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe it was other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8193.558s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there's been instances where maybe people have been uneasy about supporting a congratulatory resolution or something along those lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8202.461s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the fact of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8204.412s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It just wasn't the appropriate time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8206.213s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If the gentleman has a problem with anyone, maybe pick up the phone and call him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8210.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just wish it didn't get to this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8212.536s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I was hoping that last week was the end of it, but I just can't sit here and... And here's the other piece of it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8222.681s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It is a big, the particular promotion that this gentleman received is a very, very, very big promotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8230.785s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The vice president<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8232.29s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: of the Teamsters, who the President is Sean O'Brien, that we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8236.392s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there's over 500 members of the Teamsters Local 25 right here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8241.934s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the City Hall employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8243.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the secretaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8244.595s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the DPW only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8246.935s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You got many, many, many, many, many Teamsters that live in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8250.597s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And like I said, Mr. President, this is America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8254.118s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penter is certainly entitled to his opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8256.792s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just think last week wasn't the time nor the place during a congratulations for a gentleman that, like I said, we don't know really what happened in the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8268.179s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's two sides to every story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8270.1s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just couldn't sit here and I just wish that this didn't come up another week because it's unfortunate that this took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8282.996s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's all I got to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8284.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I just, uh, uh, other than that, I'm really, I'm really just speechless that, uh, that during a congratulations, this would come up, but consular pent is certainly entitled to his right to say anything he wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8295.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he's got to stick by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8297.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's got to stick by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8298.384s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If he, uh, if he's asked questions on it or what happened or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8302.006s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, there's really nothing else I can say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8768.272s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8768.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe the matter was reported to the school committee last evening, late in the meeting, but they actually negotiated a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8777.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with the cafeteria workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8779.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So Councilor Penta is, in fact, not correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8908.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8910.571s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So before we receive this and place it on file, I'd just like to say once again that the councilor was not correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8917.494s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9267.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9268.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, first of all, um, just a couple of minor corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9272.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The school department has not ran on a deficit the last, I would say, at least five years, as long as I can remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9277.339s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have Louise Miller here who can verify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9279.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The councillor stated that a million dollars overrun last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9283.242s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We haven't bailed them out, I would say, since 2004 or 2005.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9288.264s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's probably the last time that they had to be bailed out, and it was during tough economic times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9293.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The second thing is, this was done actually in open session, because I saw the same point where the cafeteria workers were discussed, so that was not true as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9302.361s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The last thing is, I think the sketchy part of this whole thing is someone's talking about negotiation and legal matters out of executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9311.605s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, that should be investigated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9313.185s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Obviously, the councillor has her ear to the ground and someone is reporting to her about executive session stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9318.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Until that is approved at the next regularly scheduled meeting, the minutes and stuff, it's not something I think, I mean, that's the sketchy part of this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9326.13s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So maybe we could ask the superintendent of schools to maybe look into that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9330.677s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I'm being facetious on that, but obviously there's a purpose for executive session, and that's for negotiation and legal matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9342.367s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's to discuss the pay raises, negotiation, legal matters, whether the teachers, the custodians, the secretaries get a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9354.216s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So like I said, obviously there was a lot discussed last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9359.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in negotiation and legal matters, as it appeared to be after the fact when it was back in open session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9367.38s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just wanted to point those few things out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9369.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The biggest thing was, though, that the school department has not been a million dollars in deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9374.044s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm glad to see the two new Councilors over there shaking their head, because they know the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9379.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They've been around for quite some time, and that has not been overrun in at least, at least, I would say, six or seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9385.971s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't want to go any further, because I know there was a rough patch where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9389.524s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We did have to bail them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9390.385s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe it was before Louise Milleville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9392.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Louise, you've been here how many years now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9394.99s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Four years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9396.031s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, but I think that those few factual things I just wanted to point out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9401.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Here's the other thing, last but not least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9402.998s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know much about the position, but a lot of people have been talking about we have to make the Medford Public Schools more attractable to people and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9413.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if this is a public relations, it's going to get people back from charter schools, get people back from maybe Minuteman, from other schools that we're actually doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9421.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, this position could pay for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9424.039s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, as I have in all matters, since I've been on this city council, I do believe the school department and the school committee are tasked by the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9436.322s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if it's something that they're saying they need, then I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9561.876s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9563.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would just hope that this doesn't have to do with other unions and union leadership that may be bucking up at the school system, whether the secretary's union wants this in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9573.906s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: association or other unions, because that certainly could be a person of the general... I want to use my wording correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9587.854s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A person of the general mind could think that this is the union issue, similar to the Teamsters that we just talked about a few minutes ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9596.619s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I just want to say if the school committee and the school department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9601.957s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's needed, and I support them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9603.718s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They were elected by the citizens of Medford, as were we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9609.203s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10356.269s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10357.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would be remissed if I didn't say a few words about this gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10362.014s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, when I came on the school committee scene back in 1999, I didn't really know Mr. Fresa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10369.74s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But when I met him, he was one of those guys that you pick up the phone, you make sure you go see, like Paul Kavanaugh, Honorable Justice Adam Alden, and just a real, real nice guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10382.35s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the opportunity of getting close with Mr. Fresa<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10385.317s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: through my wife's uncle, Bob Mayorko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10388.659s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so for the past 10 or 12 years, serving with Uncle Bob here on the city council, I got pretty close with Mr. Frazer to the point where I'd have coffee on Sunday nights once in a while with him and Justice Kavanaugh down at Brigham's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10404.589s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just a real good guy, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10407.471s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But when I got the call this morning, it's one of those things that you just didn't want to believe, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10412.84s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: because just this past weekend he was out and about, stopping shop, doing his shopping with former President Mayocko and just a really good guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10424.023s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd also like to acknowledge, you know, Bob Mayocko was very, very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10431.278s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to Mr. Frazer, especially after he couldn't drive anymore and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10435.019s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a real gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10436.079s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, you didn't see Al if you didn't see Paul Kavanaugh or Bob Mayorko on his arm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10442.381s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for that, I'm sure that the Frazer family is very appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10447.263s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Where Al's family, a lot of them were out of town, but he certainly had his Medford family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10453.925s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know I'll miss him over at Bob and Cheryl's house on some of the holidays and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10459.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So may he rest in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1072.132s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1072.673s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you guys for coming down this evening, Mr. Daley, with your whole entourage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1078.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a quick couple of questions on the bus stop relocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1081.799s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It appears that the bus stop, the three options are going across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1085.442s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1120.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the bus stop itself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1122.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Those red dots that you have are actually across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1140.593s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can you explain to people like myself that can't read construction maps, because it's very technical,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1148.039s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whereabouts are the three options so the viewing public will know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1151.462s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Basically, in layman's terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1158.947s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the middle of the overpass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1160.588s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Underneath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1162.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Lighting will be approved and everything else if that happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1165.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I have not looked into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1168.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's docked there until you guys started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1171.715s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now you have trucks under there with the lights at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1173.496s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's, yeah, that's a, but you can't count that as a construction is not on for a day then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1179.299s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1179.58s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's the first location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1180.94s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1192.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if you come from the restaurant and take a right, I'm assuming it's either on the left side of the street or on the right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1199.2s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All three proposed stops are on the same side of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1201.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1202.621s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you're in front of the restaurant, you come up to the westbound on-ramp to Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1206.722s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1207.342s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You take a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1208.863s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now you're facing West Medford, down Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1211.964s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is it on your left or on your right compared to the restaurant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1214.944s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you were standing at the very beginning of the ramp, it would be immediately to your left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1219.246s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To your left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1219.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you'll actually have to cross the on-ramp to Route 16 eastbound to get to the bus stop from the existing location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1244.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you're gonna have to walk by the work zone to get to the bus stops underneath the ramp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1248.699s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you go there, you're just very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1251.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Forget about the construction maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1252.6s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm having a hard time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1262.745s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So where's the restaurant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1265.426s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The restaurant's not in the picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1266.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll get both points out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1267.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because I think we're all a little puzzled by looking at that map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1301.007s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the westbound on-ramp,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1303.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you'd cross the street and the crosswalk, and it would be right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1307.621s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You walk a little bit further on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1326.017s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's probably 50 feet from the existing bus stop, maybe a little more, 75?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1329.5s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A little more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1332.045s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Could you walk over the bridge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1341.711s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's what I thought, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1342.711s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's about 500 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1343.672s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 500 feet, that's a lot for a senior citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1347.734s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're open to any suggestions, we'll put it wherever you want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1350.476s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well the problem is, we didn't even know it was an option at this point because the communication inside of this building<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1357.228s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is certainly, there's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1359.87s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: November 18th, and trust me, I know how the MBTA and DOT work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1364.534s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You guys are very good at notifying the community on what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1368.697s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's something else going on once it hits the network within City Hall, shall we say, the internal memos within City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1376.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is the first we're hearing about the three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1379.967s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I can understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1381.568s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're probably coming up with a game plan which is the best, according to the professionals, the chief of police,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1386.915s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OCD, DPW, and then bringing it to the council for final approval, where we're the approving authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1393.017s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like you said, we were under the impression the bus stop was going to stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1397.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But that leads to my second question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1400.718s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A work zone right in front of the restaurant, that's a bigger concern as far as the restaurant, the insurance company, the real estate agent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1411.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What do you, when you define original?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1426.219s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if someone parks on, for lack of a better word, the old ring road or whatever, what do you call it now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1432.4s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Clipper, Clipper ship drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1436.382s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that's what it's, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1439.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for lack of a better word, if you park on Clipper ship drive, you're still going to get access to the restaurant, the insurance company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1445.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You could still walk across the street and get on the sidewalk and then get in the restaurant, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1449.549s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1450.349s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1450.709s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1451.19s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1451.47s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When you said work zone, I was just a little, uh, well, yeah, we, we can't have vehicles there though because so basically the barriers are just going to basically divert the road out towards because all the traffic coming towards Medford square from South Medford now is going to go over the new bridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1467.472s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the traffic coming from Salem Street is now going to be diverted out, away from the restaurant, down to South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1476.659s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1477.639s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when you say work zone, it's nothing more than a diversion of 20 feet out, 30 feet out, 40 feet out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1483.764s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OK, I feel a lot comfortable now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1487.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When you said a work zone, I was figuring fences up, and those guys couldn't get to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1491.89s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Mr. Veneziano wouldn't be happy about that particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1497.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I just, I want to thank Mr. Daly and his staff too, because, uh, they, they, they obviously have been doing this communications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1504.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The breakdown has been from within the walls of this very building that we sit in this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1510.724s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, um, so if you could just keep notifying and, and, um, and I like councilor Dello Russo's idea, the green line,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1520.452s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, they've been keeping us abreast of the progress of that, probably weekly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1525.655s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Between the DOT and the Mass Gaming Commission, I've never met two agencies that notify more on a consistent basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1534.922s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's something, as far as transparency, I'm very happy about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1539.805s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The only thing the Green Line hasn't shared with us is their finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1543.527s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1545.369s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And hopefully, on a lighter note,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1547.829s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe that's going to be in about a month or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1549.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to come out with the actual report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1552.253s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that fairly correct on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1554.534s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I read that in today's Globe, but you can't take the Globe and everything else for 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1561.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, if you could just please keep the notifications coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1564.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to reach out to Mr. Daley tomorrow, give you some additional email addresses to get on the external communique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1573.67s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1574.21s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And one other person that has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1576.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, pretty good with this and put me in touch with different, um, agencies regarding the DCR and some of the other stuff going on there has been representative Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1584.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, um, I know early on in this project back in June and July, there was a concern about the, um, environmental and the river and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1592.92s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, rep Donato, uh, put, uh, put the constituents from South street in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1599.001s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, um, that, uh, that's always a good avenue of communications on, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1605.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for those people, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2539.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, Mr. Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2540.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to take 15-432 off the table and receive it and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2546.333s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The MassDOT was here this evening and that was for them to appear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3355.071s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3355.691s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, and I was going to basically make that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3357.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They actually met before the city council met last week and the paper before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3363.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is to move it from the account he's asking on the other part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3366.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the proper thing, I think, as one voting member of the council, is to move the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3373.157s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think we made it loud and clear at previous meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3376.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We wanted it to come out of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3378.56s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But obviously, based upon the data before us, they took that vote last week prior to our committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3385.885s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So on this particular paper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3389.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to not withdraw my motion for approval, because in the sense, in essence, what Councilor Penta is asking to do is take more money out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3397.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So we have to take this to get to this point now anyway, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6159.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's obviously some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6162.037s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Why don't we send this to the committee of the whole where we can have the department heads there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6166.52s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Cause it's, I just, there's some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6169.122s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6170.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would draw a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6172.504s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion to send it to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6174.385s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Lococo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6450.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This one here, uh, the city is pursuing litigation for the money that they feel is owed to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6456.138s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, we have to pay this and move approval at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6591.446s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Contradictory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7201.83s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7203.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7204.832s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is just a friendly reminder for anyone over 65 years of age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7209.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we're the only state that has a law that exempts senior citizens from having to pay for a fee to use<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7222.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, if senior citizens see a fee on their bill for 411 directory assistance calls, it's usually $2.49.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7228.877s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you see that, give a call to Comcast at 855-270-0379.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7232.299s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Could you repeat that, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7233.58s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 1-855-270-0379.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7234.021s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Verizon is 1-800-974-4111.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7250.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 6-0-0-6, and you can get the forms, fill them out, and you can be exempted that fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7257.794s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I know it's not a lot of money, but $2.50 a month for an entire year, it's certainly something for a senior citizen that's on a fixed income, and just want to spread the word on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7269.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to see more people take advantage of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7683.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7684.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would be remiss if I didn't congratulate the gentleman on his appointment as vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7690.212s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And sometimes people forget a community like Medford has over 500 members of the local 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7696.739s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We disposed of the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=760.765s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=766.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and I definitely support this this evening and I want to applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=772.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, all too often everyone sits behind this rail and in other elected positions throughout the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=779.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We say we're father veterans and we stand proudly with the veterans on Veterans Day and on Memorial Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=785.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We honor the sacrifice that many have made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=788.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is a real tangible piece of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=790.516s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: legislation that this council can stand behind boldly and send the message loud and clear that we're walking the walk, not just talking the talk when it comes to supporting the veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=800.243s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So on behalf of the local veterans, I'd like to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up and I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1455.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1457.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1458.664s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1460.586s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If she doesn't mind, I'd like to make a B paper that is in line with the fire department, but the new pieces of apparatus that were just purchased over the last 12 months, the rear step on the truck, unless you wear a size 4.5 shoe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1475.787s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: you can't safely do your job when you have to pull hose and stuff off of the back of the truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1480.669s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's about a thousand dollar part, I'm being told, I have not confirmed that, to extend the bumper so that a fire department personnel can safely stand on the rear step of these trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1493.053s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could ask the fire chief to look into it and to get this fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1499.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the interest of public safety,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1500.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: because, uh, this, this is certainly an issue I saw it firsthand down at engine two and, uh, someone's going to get injured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1508.058s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1508.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We'll do that as an amendment if it's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2794.265s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2794.826s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just have one another thing on the suspension and when he's done with his very good, uh, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3083.914s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3087.958s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3089.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: While we're under suspension, we have a taxpayer and my friend, Mr. Jack Coakley, that would like to address this honorable body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3699.341s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3700.201s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3702.002s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3704.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, Jack, I certainly understand your frustration, as I indicated on the telephone earlier today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3709.765s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe there's a timeline that National Grid is supposed to stop digging unless it's for emergency situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3716.422s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I thought it was around November 1st or October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3722.166s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could find out, first of all, who this gentleman George is, and secondly, once we do find out if a permit was issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3730.19s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I don't want to sit here and say we should put the whole project on hold, because I don't know if there's people on that street that are waiting for gas, for if there's leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3739.876s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know the circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3741.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But to not notify the neighborhood well in advance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3744.735s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: well in advance and come up with some sort of a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3748.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, it's, it's mind boggling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3786.0s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm coming over your house for the winter then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3788.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3788.922s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could find out at least like, like you say, the city of Medford has control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3792.755s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the permitting and as far as giving them the permission to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3797.739s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could find out the circumstances surrounding it and we can get back to Jack tomorrow because he needs to let his neighbors know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3805.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know there's other people in the neighborhood that are concerned about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3808.726s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's some senior citizens that live on Dwyer and in Gordley that depend on the sidewalks and the infrastructure in that immediate area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3818.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just, I wish there was more communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3821.634s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it wasn't at four o'clock this afternoon, or earlier in the afternoon when Mrs. Coakley brought it to his attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3828.199s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if we could just get the answers and find out too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3831.981s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: From the engineering office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3833.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: From the engineering office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3834.343s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if this is some upgrade for the purpose of convenience, and it's not an emergency, and it's convenience, that we do put it off until the springtime when the nice weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3847.292s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the snow plows are going to be right behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3849.073s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're already talking about snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3850.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and it's just going to create a problem after a problem after a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3854.74s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They said gas leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3855.901s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if it is gas leaks, that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3857.743s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, if it's gas leaks, it's gas leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3859.505s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We see the stories of houses blowing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3861.146s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You have to take care of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3862.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You can't put the fire department or the neighborhood people in danger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3865.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if it's not gas leaks, and it is just because they have 13 customers that want to sign up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3871.712s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and start selling gas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3875.114s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, and that was my second point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3876.615s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Jack had a very good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3879.457s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You got Barry Park down the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3881.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3883.159s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You have the new, I call it the new Dame Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3886.382s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The Walnut Hill Properties owns a property there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3890.444s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If maybe they would give us a couple spots, do something to alleviate the neighborhood's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3896.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And last but not least, last but not least,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3901.405s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got to think that between November and Christmas is not a good time to be ripping up a street that's going to last 30 days, other than an emergency situation with gas leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3913.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But they knew about it two months before this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3915.231s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3927.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3929.097s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As you know, I talk to you quite frequently and I will, uh, be updating with you tomorrow with what we can find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6768.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I move suspension of the rules to clear up some of the old business on the council agenda that's been lingering since 2014 in some cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6882.946s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're waiting to get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6883.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just sitting on the agenda now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6884.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We got the report We got a report back on that didn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6926.184s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, but the solicitor has kept us updated along the whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6929.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right, let him respond again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7098.426s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was the money to cut the budget and then take it out of the other account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7107.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The budget passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7127.223s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the same as 14 five 68 from the city solicitor update on the TV three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7190.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 15-561.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7191.636s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7193.076s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7193.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7195.017s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Without prejudice, in case that gentleman comes back,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7212.279s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm just saying that, so if the gentleman does want to come back and appear, it's within the 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7216.862s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's right around the 90 days, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7219.684s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7220.364s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8079.041s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8081.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I certainly agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn's frustrations and the business owners that should have close to up to the minute what's going on with the project, especially when it affects their businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8094.701s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I don't want to send out the wrong message that if the City Council votes for a cease and desist,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8099.902s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that the trucks are going to pack up, they're going to leave, and there'll be no work that gets done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8103.544s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's just inaccurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8104.865s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's irresponsible for us to let people think that we have the power to do that, because we do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8111.728s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Furthermore, if we do delay it, if we had the authority for a cease and desist, it's only going to add additional days on the end of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8120.072s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it'll be two years and three days if we did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8123.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as I stated, I think they have to work on their communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8129.18s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The particular department that is overseeing this project, which is a state project, if not the City of Medford, the Mass Department of Transportation, as the President indicated, between them and the Gaming Commission, I'm getting emails twice a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8146.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with updates on the projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8148.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And given that that's the same entity, MassDOT, I don't see why we can't get the same, and interested people like the restaurants, like the banks, like the auto schools and everyone else in the particular area can sign up for those alerts as well, as people along the Green Line Extension route receive weekly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8168.448s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could just ask for that, but I just don't want to send out the wrong message that a cease and desist<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8174.19s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is something that we have any control over whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8177.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8690.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8692.937s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What do you think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8694.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I posed this to the body in the form of a resolution, having a committee of the whole and take up all papers that are in all subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8703.047s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have stuff in there from 2007 that just never dealt with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8707.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Or they could have been acted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8708.892s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They could have been acted upon, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8710.973s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I looked at the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8711.854s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So in other words, every time the clerk prints out the city council tracking sheet for subcommittees, committees of the whole, it's just wasting ink and paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8720.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Therefore, I think that this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8722.107s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: time where, especially with two members of the council are moving on into retirement, it would be the appropriate time to clean up the business beforehand of this particular council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8731.956s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a good idea, but whatever the council wishes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8736.2s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we want to keep stuff in certain committees, you keep it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8738.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there is stuff that works itself out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8749.657s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So everybody has to call a subcommittee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8751.638s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the subcommittee meetings would have to be called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8766.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, whatever procedurally we decide to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8774.237s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I agree 100%, but I also think we have to do whatever the proper procedure is to clear up the council tracking resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8781.081s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's 17 pages long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8782.861s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I say that in a funny fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8785.423s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not 17 pages, but it's quite lengthy, and it's stuff that we're talking about buildings that don't even exist in our community anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8792.226s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We get papers, and they're talking about the DPW water building that burned down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8796.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The water building is no longer there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8800.891s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whatever the proper procedure is, I think we should address all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8812.147s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If not, you guys deal with it next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8822.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do you want to do it on a Friday night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8825.777s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, we can do it this Thursday, 10 o'clock, instead of going to Medford-Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8833.141s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Madam Vice President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=101.718s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whenever you're done, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=103.499s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, Councilor Camuso, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=106.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=109.207s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As we are all aware, we just met, and I joined my council colleague, Councilor Robert Penta, over the past three weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=119.593s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we brought the name forward of Frederick Lasky as a member of the guiding commission to represent this honorable body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=127.758s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm happy to say that it was a unanimous vote of the Medford City Council at the meeting, and I'd just like to make a motion to approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=137.892s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: on behalf of Councilor Penta, myself and the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=141.674s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Musso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2323.418s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2324.478s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I certainly agree with all the sentiments of all of my colleagues this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2328.6s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is very disturbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2331.622s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As it was alluded to in prior comments, we're lucky that the only thing that happened was lassity of people's personal property and nothing more egregious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2343.287s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just, it's very disturbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2347.689s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the parents are very concerned about this, and they very well should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2353.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that they have to have some sort of round table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2355.971s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know the chief of police and the police department is active in the schools, but you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2361.972s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We actually, several years ago, there was the STARS program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2365.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not so sure if it's still out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2367.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the school threat assessment response team, and it's made up of all the area police departments and NMLAC and some of the other SWAT teams in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2376.036s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if we could just get an update too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2379.616s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's unfortunate, but it's things,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2382.925s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: of this magnitude, when it happens, you sort of start thinking about other things that could possibly happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2390.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The people that lived in the Watertown-Cambridge line never thought that there'd be a car chase in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2398.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: involving homemade grenades and bombs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2403.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, and we just have to make sure that every precaution is taken when it comes to the safety of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2409.923s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just want to go on record in support of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2412.804s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this isn't something that should wait the 10 days for the mayor to get and then send off to the superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2418.886s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is something that we should get right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2421.747s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Also, if we could ask the chief of police for an update, because the surveillance video<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2427.365s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that they do have of the individual perpetrator, look like a pretty clear picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2432.728s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So hopefully, with the public's help, if it hasn't been already, but with the public's help, they can identify and hold this person responsible, or persons responsible for this egregious behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2766.917s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2769.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2771.466s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When you look at the way the street sweeping is done in this community, there is a more intelligent way that it could be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2778.989s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, people still think that this is five years ago when you can just put the big pile of leaves in front of your house and they used to just come down and pick it all up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2789.353s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unfortunately, if we remember that the equipment repair over those years when we did that was significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2799.298s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2800.578s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, we have a bigger problem that we have to start thinking about, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2803.839s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Councilor Caraviello alluded to, the leaves are not even on the ground yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2809.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What's going to happen is the streets are going to be swept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2813.041s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The leaves are going to fall down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2814.541s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The catch basins are going to get clogged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2816.942s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The streets are going to become a sheet of ice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2818.922s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're going to have public safety issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2822.443s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So hopefully the DPW, and they advertised the new commissioner's position the other day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2830.464s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hopefully, we can get someone in there that can really tackle this, Mr. President, and tackle it quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2836.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because on the heels of street sweeping, it's snow plowing again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2840.129s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if you look back to last year's treacherous year, we're only asking for problems if we get half of the amount of snow that we got last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2852.335s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One of the best pieces of equipment they own is that big snowblower that was purchased back in the 1970s or the 60s, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2857.818s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not even sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2860.667s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But they had to take that out, get it up and running with Timmy McCarthy and the rest of the mechanics in the garage, and get that out there to widen the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2869.411s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Even the small side streets, you couldn't get a fire truck down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2872.272s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm just thinking ahead here, where if we start getting the catch basins clogged and icing up, we're going to have some major problems on our hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2882.116s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2883.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Normally, the street sweeping is done even earlier than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2886.478s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But unfortunately, Mother Nature and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2889.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The changing colors of the leaves happen later this year, which we do not have any control of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2896.21s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Last but not least, this city council pushed far in the past to get later leaf pickup, which we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2903.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But unfortunately, the last leaf pickup is going to be picked up before all the leaves are down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2909.235s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's another whole thing that we're going to be dealing with moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2913.496s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe if we can look at waste management, see if they can send an additional pickup as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2919.27s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: after most of the leaves are down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s9uJGZJhvT8&t=2920.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So thank you for bringing this up, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=138.0s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=138.981s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=143.303s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is becoming a major problem in the West Medford area, not only for the business community, but also for the traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=150.79s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And unfortunately, these things over the last few weeks have been knocked down at the height of rush hour, whether it's five o'clock at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=159.734s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It comes to a total gridlock every time the trains are coming by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=163.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They have to get the police cruisers out there, stop the traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=166.277s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just becoming a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=169.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's about time, given that it's a state road, Route 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=172.5s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that the Department of Transportation has to get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=176.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There has to be a total look at that whole area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=179.165s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We still have those things down the middle of the road that divide the road that we had to put in in lieu of the horns being blown every time a train comes by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=189.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But at this point, I think we have to look at a major upgrade of the entire West Medford train station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=196.018s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=198.72s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the coming few years, there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=202.824s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: excuse me, in the coming few years, there's going to be possibility down in that area for business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=206.967s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Have we ever looked at putting the train platform on the other side of the train tracks so that it stops behind, say, the liquor store in that area, so that it doesn't have to keep the gates down for a long time, that it stops before the gates, and then it, when it's coming from Lowell, it would go by the gate and then stop<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=226.471s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not so sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=227.211s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if we have the room, but with all the projects going on here from the DOT and our community right now, whether it's Craddock Bridge, whether it's the Green Line, I think we have to take a serious look at the West Medford train station because it is becoming a nuisance, not only this particular matter, but just the amount of foot traffic in the area, which we encourage for environmentally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=249.388s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We want to have people take the train, but at the same token, we want to have it the safest possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=254.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the best aesthetically pleasing that we can do as well, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=258.587s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So just food for thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=261.308s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We are going to have to do a big cleanup of that parking lot at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=264.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it may be the appropriate time to tie all this in together, maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=270.905s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If there's people in that immediate area that are looking to maybe sell their property, might be an opportunity for an economic development engine too, where you could actually reconfigure some of the area down there, build brand new storefronts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=284.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a million things you could do down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=287.636s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's over an acre of land if you take the, what is it, Stevens Auto Body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=293.44s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The West Medford parking lot and, like, that whole area, it's over an acre of land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=297.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the development possibilities are endless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=301.063s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's something to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=303.264s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It also abuts the Medford Housing Authority, which is right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=306.365s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I think it's something long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=308.646s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We've got to have a long-term vision in this community, and I think it's one area we could look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=312.447s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But on the immediate concern that Councilor Caraviello brought up, I think it's something that has to be looked at sooner than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=718.045s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=719.205s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I think that this should be sent to the transportation subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=722.788s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, there's a couple of papers in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=724.309s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, Councilor Penton is the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=726.612s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's one paper in there from October 2014, a year ago, to discuss bicycle safety issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=733.236s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that hasn't been called yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=734.737s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe we can put that, as well as the Craddock Bridge discussion that was supposed to take place in the Transportation Subcommittee from March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=741.461s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe if we have one meeting, if Councilor Pentos thinks there's a need for it, call a meeting as the chairperson and take all three of these matters up on the same evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=752.087s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there's been quite some time has surpassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=756.828s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there's also a couple other ones on the committee of the whole regarding the bus stop down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=762.552s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe, do we want to move it all into the transportation subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=766.014s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if we can parliamentary, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1400.486s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1403.163s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This petition was before us last week looking for action on the bollards, actually a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1408.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this council was pretty vocal getting the bollards done in a quick fashion from the meeting moving forward, not a quick leading up to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1420.783s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Obviously, we're all aware that somewhat created World War III down there, as you just alluded to, the businesses and the neighbors and there's a lot of friction right now and there's some animosity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1434.949s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: being thrown at some certain members of this city council, too, which is unfair, because council has fought for what they believe was the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1441.714s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I think once and for all, maybe we slow these modifications down, the loading zone and the bus stop, and get in a traffic engineer that actually we can pay, the city can pay, and they can look at it and find out what the safest, the most business-friendly solution<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1462.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is that certainly will help the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1465.458s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the chief of police, the DPW commissioner, Cassandra up in engineering, they're all very good professionals at what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1474.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But only a traffic engineer can come in and tell us that, hey, you're going to get the best impact, the safest cutout in the curb is in this spot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1484.969s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That the loading zone should actually be at this spot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1489.251s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we spend $5,000,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1491.419s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for a consultant to come in here and give us an actual framework on what the best solution is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1498.641s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At that point, it's totally on the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1501.102s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the neighbors against the businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1503.063s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the businesses against the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1505.243s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the city taking the leadership role and taking the ball right out of your court, so to say, and doing what is needed in that immediate area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1514.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because I can tell you right now, there's already a lot of animosity about this current paper on here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1519.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it hasn't even been heard yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1521.46s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: until about five minutes ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1524.923s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So with that being said, I think we should put the brakes on and ask the mayor to bring in a traffic engineer and come up with a solid plan that no one can be blamed for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1536.391s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because quite honestly, as I said last Wednesday, when those bollards went in, I spoke to several city councilors and the phones were ringing off the hook to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1546.243s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly, I don't even think that's over yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1549.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There may be some legal action with those bollards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1553.425s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Businesses feel that the city shouldn't have come in and did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1557.786s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But that's a situation for our law department to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1561.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So with that being said, I just think the professionals need to come in and make these determinations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1567.808s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly, if we're getting them in here, we should have them maybe in West Medford look too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1573.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Bargain spot lickers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1575.285s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right now, they're a little upset with the parking lot closing down in a few weeks, where they have no parking in front of their store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1585.767s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe we look at some of these squares as a whole, including Medford Square, and have a traffic engineer tell us, tell the city representatives where these bus stops should be, and not moving them because someone picks up the phone and haphazardly calls us and asks us to move a bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1601.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can make an educated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1603.193s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: decision on it based upon fact and not hearsay and people's personal preferences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1610.159s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because one thing I know about this, it's like permit parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1612.641s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You do this street, and they love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1614.943s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The next street now starts, it's the trickle-down effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1617.585s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you do that, it's the same thing with bus stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1619.727s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You put it in front of one business, and then the bank gets upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1623.209s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then you move it from the bank, and the next store gets upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1626.712s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could look to hire a traffic engineer, I just think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1631.863s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the most professional way to proceed at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1707.604s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1712.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The two papers that are before us are to move a bus stop, and then the second one is to possibly the amendment was to add a loading zone, loading dock, loading zone area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1722.364s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's not going to affect pedestrian traffic at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1725.106s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Those are both on the main street and not the sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1728.827s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm just not really hearing how it's going to affect the pedestrian traversing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1751.494s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, with all due respect to the Councilor, the trucks are blocking a street and a sidewalk that are not even on the bus route, and they were asking for a loading zone to be placed on Main Street and not Harvard Street, because there isn't the room on Harvard Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1766.184s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You couldn't get two trucks by if one truck was parked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1768.806s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And with the bollards now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1770.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They can't do that if you put one more, like you said, down at what, 259?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1775.351s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Did you say 259 Harvard Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1777.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You'd like to see the bollards go down to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1779.434s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1779.574s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Which was the address you said on Harvard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1782.656s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 215, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1783.097s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So 215.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1786.379s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as I stated, the pedestrians traversing these bus stops moving in a quick fashion in the loading zone does not affect the pedestrians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1794.465s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Dealing with the problem at hand on Harvard Street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1798.004s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We'll do that, but I think we're making some progress with the bollards, but they have to be extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2334.597s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this evening, as I suggested, we send this to the Subcommittee on Transportation because the paper before us by Councilor Penta is to move the bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2344.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And for us to do anything without, as you stated and as Mr. Silva stated, you want to work together, everyone should be at that table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2352.807s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: as the last process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2353.767s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the appropriate subcommittee is the transportation subcommittee where these things can be hashed out collectively and as well take up some of the stuff that's been left over hanging in there from 2014 and early 15 that has not been addressed yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2368.391s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe we can have like a marathon meeting and get some of it cleared up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2376.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's not my committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2378.014s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's not my committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2804.027s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2805.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Penta, for putting this on this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2809.668s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We all know Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2810.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=2812.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: just a wonderful person a great teacher in our community and of course her husband who's not only a biggest biggest fan of all the city councillors, but also a friend of my aunt Carol, so just want to want to congratulate you and your lovely wife for this honor and thank you for councillor Penta for Bringing it up this evening giving her the recognition that she deserves Thank You Councilor Councilor Marks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3537.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3539.289s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3540.07s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3541.17s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this isn't about statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3544.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This isn't one in 30, one in 60, one in 10, one in five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3548.734s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3550.195s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3550.962s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If it's one person in the city of Medford that we can help save their life and put them in the right direction, then we support it or we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3558.585s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're all entitled to our vote this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3561.026s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The statistics, as far as I'm concerned, are semantics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3565.788s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is something good that the Medford City Council can get behind to save one life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3571.705s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One life is enough, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3574.047s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you go up to Medford High School, you go to Somerville High School, you go to Woburn High School, you go to any number of high schools around here, and the kids will tell you, it's easier to get pills than it is to buy a case of Budweiser down at the liquor store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3584.754s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3587.276s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3589.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, when there's a paper like this before us, and of course, on first face value, when I got my packet this weekend, I reached out and I discussed this with Councilor Knight, and just, I wanted to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3601.125s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that kids that are suffering with terminal ill cancer, kids that are suffering with diseases that are going to ultimately be fatal, whether there is still mechanisms in place that they can be prescribed the needed doses of pain medication so that they can die with dignity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3621.46s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And in my little research I did this weekend, there is many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3625.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whether it's Dilaudid, whether it's morphine, there are other substances out there that can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3631.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: be used, but I think this is a positive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3635.268s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just look at collectively as a city council, this council as a whole, all seven of us stood in unity a year ago to push for the hiring of a full-time substance abuse coordinator for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3650.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We stood strong<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3652.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the mayor took our collective recommendation from all seven members of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3659.072s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That is in effect today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3660.433s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We didn't hire a full-time $80,000 a year salaried position that had unanimous support from the seven members of this council and the city administration because topics that we're talking about right now are not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3673.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a major issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3674.735s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is something we can get behind on the ground level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3677.936s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can be, and I get passionate about this obvious for obvious reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3682.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, but if we can get behind this and it can save one life, one life, then as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the best votes we can take as a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3691.841s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We were arguing about bus stops a half hour ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3693.983s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We were arguing about other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3697.286s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the real deal stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3699.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I ask my colleagues to all support this this evening in the interest of saving one life here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=3705.313s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4454.258s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4455.338s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4457.079s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may, if Councilor Knight and the President would allow me just to give a brief update of the Middlesex District Attorney Opiate Task Force that I was appointed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4467.262s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4469.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The task force is really getting into this epidemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4476.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just to give a quick background, it's leaders that Middlesex District Attorney Marion Ryan has put together of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4483.505s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's law enforcement, health care providers, doctors, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4487.047s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The two lead hospitals are Hallmark Health and the Leahy Clinic's conglomerate out of Burlington, policy makers and elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4497.371s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One of the key doctors that brings a lot of the science and the statistics to it is Dr. O'Connor out of Middlesex Recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4504.574s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He has quite a very, very interesting story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4508.636s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he's bringing the science behind addiction so that people can understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4513.85s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One of the big pieces is the task force is working on the stigma, the stigma that people that are addicted to drugs are given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4522.956s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And unfortunately, it's easy to forget that they're human beings that are dealing with issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4530.981s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's being worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4533.063s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Two big things that I found very interesting, dentists, dentist officers and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4540.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What's the other one that's back here, where they do the root canals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4547.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Oral surgeons, yeah, and endodontists are a major area where people get these pills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4554.473s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Second thing that I would never even think of, the Middlesex DA's office is working with the realtors in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4560.477s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You have open houses on Sundays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4562.138s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People come through the house looking at the house, oh, beautiful home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4565.04s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They go into the bathroom, they open up the medicine cabinet, Oxycontin sitting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4570.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are things that you'd never think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4574.668s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the education piece is getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4577.248s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hallmark Health has been a leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4579.649s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're doing a study right now on back pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4582.049s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Anyone that goes into the emergency room with back pain, the most that they can be prescribed is 72 hours worth of pain medication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4590.471s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then it's up to them to go to their primary care and actually get good follow up on the source of their pain and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4599.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4601.381s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Middlesex district attorney is working with the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4604.542s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Representative Donato is on this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4607.503s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With Senator Lewis out of Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4609.543s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Middlesex DA has a bill right now to limit to 72 hours supply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4614.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a bill that's going to be heard this legislative session, 72 hours supply of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4621.566s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: opiate pain medication out of the emergency rooms, once again, until you see your specialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4625.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's real good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4628.27s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just this last meeting, addicts that are in recovery were brought in and talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4633.993s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was young mothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4635.754s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Young mothers, you would never in a million years think that these people were addicted to heroin or other opiates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4642.979s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's just amazing hearing their stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4645.42s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's educating the people in that room that can make a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4651.057s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4653.518s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If anyone else has any specific questions regarding that task force, please feel free to ask me and at least we'll put you in touch with someone that can answer other specific questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4662.381s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the Middlesex DA, Marion Ryan, really is taking a leadership role on this in the county.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4667.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the second of two task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4669.224s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The other one is in Northern Middlesex County, which is Lowell and Bill Ricker and up near that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4674.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is something that I'm honored to serve on because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4682.124s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: working collectively, if we can work collectively as elected officials in this room and with the DA's office, with Representative Donato and Senator Jalen and the other representatives, and get the right data into the hands of the people that can make a difference up on Beacon Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4698.333s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Governor Baker just came out with his bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4701.595s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very impressive, some of the stuff in his bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4704.077s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So this is something, and it's nonpartisan, because addiction does not discriminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4710.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's no Democrat next to an addict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4712.086s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's no Republican next to an addict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4716.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't discriminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4717.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's a work in progress, but one day at a time, hopefully you can get people the data to make these decisions and the laws change that need to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4733.073s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But we're doing what we can on the ground floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4735.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I want to thank my council colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4737.235s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because this is one issue, one issue that we stood tall on, each and every member of this Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4743.578s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We hit it head on collectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4745.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We sent a strong message to the mayor that it's something that's going on in our community and we all work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4750.641s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we all should be proud of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=4752.601s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So basically, that's it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7795.542s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7797.223s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, as we're all aware,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7800.603s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: About a month, month and a half ago, I think it was, the city council, upon the recommendation of the mayor, enacted an ordinance to establish a new garden commission here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7814.991s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I did support that, and then it became law, and at this point the mayor has appointed his two individuals to become members or commissioners of the garden commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7830.634s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Upon him appointing his people, Amanda Bowen, very, very active in the gardening club, reached out to city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7839.501s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at this point, we have a committee of the whole in the upcoming weeks, I'm assuming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7844.566s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7845.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I would like to bring the name of Frederick Lasky forward with Councilor Penta for the commissioner that is appointed by the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7860.243s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Lasky has done an outstanding job down at Riverbend Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7865.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Many a Saturday mornings when I'm down there for either soccer or T-ball with my son, we see Mr. Lasky in the garden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7872.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He does a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7875.875s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I approached Mr. Lasky and asked him if he'd be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7879.14s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think he'd be a wonderful addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7880.681s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We all know his commitment to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7882.822s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're not going to find anyone, uh, that's more well respected than, um, direct Alaska.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7887.865s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, I would like to respectfully put his name, uh, before the subcommittee, um, sorry, before the committee of the whole for the city council appointment on the motion of council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7985.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7987.397s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to congratulate the distinguished gentleman to my right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7992.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=7993.299s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Caraviello, this is the first time in the Medford-Kiwanis history that the same gentleman or lady was elected president for two times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8004.541s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to congratulate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8006.822s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8028.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And last but not least, I want to thank him and his committee for putting on a great Taste of Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8033.371s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because as I stayed home with my son that evening, my wife had a fabulous time at the Taste of Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8039.978s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8040.338s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With Adam and you and the rest of them, the rest of the councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8043.939s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8164.599s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Not on this particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8165.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I do support this wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8168.057s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8184.351s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Isn't the National Guard all reservists?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8186.432s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Excuse me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8188.214s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The National Guard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8190.616s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Active duty is not the National Guard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8192.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That would be the Army, Marines, the Air Force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8204.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The records of the- Mr. President- Councilor Tommaso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8207.897s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may, I'd just like to say a few words before we close this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8214.362s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to wish everyone well next week as I'm sitting at home, watching TV, enjoying my next Tuesday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8224.729s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This has been a great election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8226.968s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This, and I'm not gonna make it political at all, I'd just like to say a few words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8230.71s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This has been a fun election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8232.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You look at it, there hasn't been an election for mayor in this community for 28 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8236.313s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When Marilyn Perica and Michael McGlynn went head to head in an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8241.675s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Next Tuesday, you have three races, and everyone should get out and vote, because it's your school committee, it's your city council, and it's your mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8252.68s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is unprecedented here in the city of Medford for 28 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8256.36s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there are two candidates for the chief executive position in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8261.701s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I want to wish them two, as well as everyone else that's named, appears on the ballot next week, well in their endeavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8268.383s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm not going to miss it that much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=8271.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So best of luck to all of you and the people at home that are on the ballot as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1599.18s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1600.461s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1602.242s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1604.063s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, I want to thank Councilor Tarviello for putting this on the agenda this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1608.525s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this last week's debate, there was something that we haven't seen, the enthusiasm in that room for both candidates, all Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1618.33s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was just something that we haven't seen in a long, long time in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1623.848s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, when I first got sworn in as a member of the Medford School Committee, that was the venue when Governor Salucci was out here and he swore all of us in, both school committee and city council and mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1635.297s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, you know, it was just a wonderful place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1639.18s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I remember, you look at some of the old photographs from the swearing in in 2000, and you can see just in the photographs the upgrades that have taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1649.44s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: since the year 2000 or so at that very beautiful place that we call the Chevalier Theater in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1659.302s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, as we left the debate and traversed Medford Square going to grab a bite to eat after, all the restaurants were packed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1669.024s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Carol's, Salvatore's, the overflow was down at Bocelli's and Razo's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1673.905s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was just something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1676.332s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that the businesses can use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1680.094s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And think of the meals tax that was brought in just that evening by the influx of people that were out spending their money in the squares that not necessarily come out on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1692.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I mean, I'm speechless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1697.922s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got to just really think about what that place can be, especially the colonial theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1704.168s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is owned by Emerson College now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1706.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They just took it offline for the next few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1709.173s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're not so sure where they're going to go with the theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1715.159s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The BU owns a theater that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1719.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Not really sure what they're going to do with their theatre right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1721.651s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as the premier real estate agent in our community just said, the money's not in the theatres.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1727.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The money's in condominiums inside these theatres.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1730.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's something certainly that we're not looking at here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1735.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But as that happens throughout New England and the greater Boston area, as the gentleman spoke earlier, there's going to be a need for theatres like ours that hold 1,200 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1747.841s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as I said, the investments that have been made there as a result of Representative Donato, who came through a few years ago and all the seats were done over, the acoustics, I believe, the organ was repaired, or is in the process of being repaired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1762.791s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a lot of good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1764.412s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the night of that mayoral debate, not only the dignity and the respect that was shown for the two candidates to one another on that stage, but the enthusiasm and the Medford pride that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1777.022s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: was exhumed through that whole area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1780.864s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The restaurants and everything else, it was something that I was actually very, very proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1785.246s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I went in there thinking we were just gonna see a debate and go home, but I saw a lot more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1789.087s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I saw a lot of Medford people that are excited that there's an election, are excited to participate, watching that debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1795.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And last but not least, the first I'm hearing about it this evening is about the debate not being played.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1802.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They made it loud and clear that that was going to be on the public access channel, I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1807.928s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we can get an update from the mayor, because certainly I think it's very important that the debates be played just as the Tufts University events are being broadcast on the local access channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1821.459s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could get an update from the mayor's office on that particular piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1825.403s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And also, if we could send out a thank you to the Somerville Community Access TV for coming in that evening and providing quality camera work and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1836.348s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know the sound from what I heard was a little bit off at the beginning, but they tweaked it throughout the debate, and it was just a great production.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1845.312s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to commend my colleague, Councilor Penta, for participating that evening, as well as our former colleague, Stephanie Burke,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1854.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: participating, because it takes two candidates to have a debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1857.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And both of them stepped up, did something that's not that easy, and brought a lot of Medford pride to the Medford community last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1901.309s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1906.01s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Who is saying that this event's not being played?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1908.131s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, they've been publicizing it that it's going to be getting replayed and replayed the beginning and Mr. Veneziano, the whole group, that was the intent from Jump Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1916.056s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Otherwise they wouldn't have brought in scat and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1918.658s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Does anyone know who's saying this from the city or do you have an answer Rob?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1924.662s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do you know where this is being said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1931.68s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, we can't govern on rulings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3197.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just waiting to take the vote, that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3839.188s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3841.509s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, appreciate you being here again, Mr. Zamparelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3844.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3845.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't have any specific questions at this point, but you guys are being very, very proactive, being here a couple times, holding the other community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3855.592s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm very impressed, to be honest with you, because sometimes we get the calls after the fact to clean up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3863.216s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you guys are being very proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3865.777s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And based upon that, I know that if I do get any questions, I'll be calling you at your office for specific residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3871.36s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But thank you for being upfront, open, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3875.567s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very accessible so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6475.112s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may, can we also send to the superintendent of Y is in the DPW commissioner on behalf of the resident to check the manhole covers currently at between Walcott and Woburn on high street, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6486.979s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If they can do something to tidy them up so that, especially now that the snow plowing and stuff is going to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6491.142s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I hate to even think about it, but within a few months, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7562.067s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7563.607s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just for the record, because we're talking about an individual, there was no allegations of beating anyone up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7568.329s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, no, but I'm just saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=37.266s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=38.907s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to suspend rule number 33 to take papers 15-693 and 15-694 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=41.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, suspension of the rules to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=85.777s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can we explain what we're voting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=87.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I didn't hear the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=834.334s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=836.135s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, if it's okay with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=837.936s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Fritz, um, she knows that this city council has been very active, particularly in the South Medford area to get things done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=846.421s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, I would suggest we send this to the transportation subcommittee because nine out of 10 of the issues that she's presented our, um, transportation issues, number one, and number two, uh, like the, the spots next to Oasis, we have to get a ruling from the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=860.41s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If it's private property, if we can restrict them from parking there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=864.203s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and all of these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=865.744s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would say I'd like to make a motion to send this to the Transportation Subcommittee if we could meet within a week or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=871.667s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What is that feedback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=994.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's one of the busiest businesses in South Medford right now, though, by Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1002.444s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if you talk to the gentleman that runs that business and some of the other businesses, they say maybe the condos were too much for the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1009.289s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you hear both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1011.41s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, I understand your concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1015.805s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But that whole block has predominantly been a C2 and a C1 district, commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1023.971s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My thing is, if Oasis didn't go in there, it may be another bakery or another business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1028.514s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not going to be a rental unit for housing or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1032.497s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's zoned, commercial zoned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1646.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do you actually have the minutes with you, Ian, that we can take a look at of the votes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1650.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because I know one thing that you stated regarding refurbished secondhand signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1656.338s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't believe that is 100% accurate, because Steve Tanaglia does the signage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=1670.009s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They reuse signs and re-letter them, but we don't purchase them secondhand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2535.236s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2537.657s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's two motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2539.518s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we've heard the complaints at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2541.799s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We want to get action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2543.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's two different ways that people think would be the best possible way to go about doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2548.602s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One is through the subcommittee process where you can actually have the DPW commissioner in front of us and the city solicitor that can tell us if the bollards are legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2557.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The building commissioner can be there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2560.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because right now, I don't know if the spots next to the jewelers and next to Oasis are legal spots or illegal spots based upon zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2568.945s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And these are the questions that I'd like to know, because the traffic commission may have taken a vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2573.927s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I do see that, and I appreciate the minutes of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2576.989s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And they have taken an affirmative vote to put the ballads up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2579.891s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But are we going to get people that are property owners to come after the city now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2586.452s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: because it's taken up a pocket spot that goes along with the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2588.833s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are the things I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2590.233s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So my recommendation is to still send it to the transportation subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2594.474s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um, and, and I know there's another recommendation on the floor, but at this point I suggest we take a vote and whatever way it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2746.956s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Does the chair have a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2798.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And over the past, I've been working with you over the past five or six years, I would say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2803.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I've only lived in Medford five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2804.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2806.06s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And oftentimes I say, have you called the police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2809.742s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when the police are notified of a specific situation, they do send someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2813.604s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It may not be instantaneously based upon other stuff going on in the city, but they eventually do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2840.059s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I can tell you right now it's not that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2842.181s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They may be tied up with other stuff, they eventually do come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2848.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you have a truck parked on the sidewalk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2851.581s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and they don't come, then I expect you to call one of the members of this council, any of the seven sitting here, or the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2857.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2857.583s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I can assure you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2858.303s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2858.883s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, I can assure you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2859.824s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I call him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2860.884s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If he didn't get a hold of someone to get down there, shame on him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2866.446s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, the police department has someone go down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2868.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2869.507s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They haven't when you called?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2870.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2873.908s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is an enforcement issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2874.908s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If this was going on on my sidewalk, I'd call the police, or anybody else in this city would call the police, and they would be down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2887.188s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=2887.908s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're acknowledging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3305.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's also a request to move a bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3309.061s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penta chairs the subcommittee on transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3312.202s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's several items in there that the meeting hasn't been called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3314.782s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So this is, a lot more has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3318.874s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The bus stop moving has to be done at that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3322.515s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's our, we said it a few weeks ago about moving the bus stops in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3326.576s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That falls under the city council's domain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3329.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if nothing else, we should have the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3330.997s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Vote on it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3334.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You don't have to send in some mystery committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3336.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Sir, don't interrupt the council, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3337.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as I said, the chairperson should call a meeting to discuss some of these other issues that are present in itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3546.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The role is called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3547.811s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would ask respectfully that chairperson Penta holds a subcommittee meeting to discuss the bus stop<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3553.699s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and the rest of the papers that have been lingering in that transportation subcommittee for some time, uh, fought with so that we can take up the stuff that actually has the domain here at the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3623.256s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That the chairman holds a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=3624.717s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's stuck lingering in there for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4112.604s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4113.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you refer to our budget on page 13, we funded the negotiated salaries account, which was line item 5110, for $265,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4122.366s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's a number that we all should know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4701.243s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, I'd just like to thank Mr. Veneziano, as well as the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4705.065s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And also, if we could send a acknowledgment and a congratulations to Margaret Weigel, who was just appointed by the mayor to a three-year term on the Chevalier Auditorium Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=4718.253s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could make that as a motion, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5129.301s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5130.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just want to announce<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5133.165s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This Sunday, October 18th, 2015 at 2 p.m., there's going to be the groundbreaking in the coalition AFTA that's going to feature entertainment, and it's going to be a somber day in memory of Crystal Campbell, but it's also going to be a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5151.911s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the beginning of keeping her memory alive forever in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5155.752s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The mayor has worked very, very hard to get us to the point we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5160.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in collaboration with the Medford City Council, where there were several votes last year that were before us to move the project forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5168.281s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's just going to be a real nice day to keep Crystal Campbell, Lingzi Liu, Officer Collier, and Martin Richard, to keep their memories alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5177.542s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to just announce it's Sunday at 2 PM, right here at the corner of Riverside Ave and Ring Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5184.064s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And everyone is invited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5187.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I hear the Givino sisters are going to sing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5189.465s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5190.635s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And they were beautiful the other day at Mr. Scarpelli's funeral up at St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5195.557s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Francis Church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5196.897s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the Giovino sisters, they always nail it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ37Ro1sDkM&t=5200.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Voce Angelorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=415.891s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=416.832s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I certainly think that this is a positive move, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=423.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And my only concern when it comes to this, I do plan on voting for it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=429.523s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But my one question is, you said outside people are still allowed to use their fishing and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=436.249s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Parkland, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=437.03s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Parkland, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=439.232s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is there a dollar amount that we're not going to be getting at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=442.741s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Has that been looked at as far as fees and stuff in the past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=463.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, the reason I ask, I want to make sure that because of this move this evening, next year people aren't going to be looking at a substantial increase in the fees because we are limiting certain resources to Medford residents only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=476.406s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I think that's a fair question and it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=482.131s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I do plan on supporting this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=833.24s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could also just send a little note of thanks to Representative Donato for offering the services of the House Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=840.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would say that this has a favorable shot of getting passed when it hits there where they were an integral part of drafting the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=847.05s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, they were quite helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=849.091s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=4504.997s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If the vote's going to take place this Friday, why don't we table it for one week and take it up next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5369.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for your monumental efforts to get this on the ballot, because definitely there is pros and cons of this as we speak to different people throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5381.384s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's no better way than to get an actual gauge than to have people actually participate and take that vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5390.327s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Coincidentally, Governor Baker this morning was in the Great Hall up at the Statehouse, and he was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5398.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: having a little gathering to celebrate the 15th year anniversary of the signing of the original bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5404.306s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe it was on the Governor Salucci back in 02?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5408.448s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Swift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5408.808s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right, Governor Swift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5409.649s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5410.189s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5411.99s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Governor Swift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5412.771s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that took place earlier today up at the Statehouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5416.553s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I actually look forward to the results of this portion of the ballot question that's going to take place in November, because it's certainly going to tell<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5428.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the elected officials moving forward, where the interests are, I think, throughout the community as a whole, if people are behind the Brooks Estate, say, that we just discussed, or behind other areas like the Royal House that would be eligible for funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5446.472s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it may give a better picture moving forward on moving certain projects forward and maybe not so much as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5455.24s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I think that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5457.115s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The results will be indicative on where people want this community to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5462.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm looking forward to that as a bigger piece of the whole picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5465.7s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, I just want to thank you for your commitment to get the signatures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5470.663s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know often over the last 16 years as an elected official here in our community, we often heard people say, we're going to get the signatures and we're going to put this on the ballot and this and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5480.203s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it really never comes to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5482.625s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you and other members of the public out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5490.552s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I must have seen Mimi more over the past two months than I've seen her in a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5496.316s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think since Tom Birmingham's election, way back when, when she was a big shot at the SEIU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5502.181s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I just want to thank you all for your effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5506.084s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I look forward to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5508.206s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: working with you, whatever way this goes, at least for a month or so, because I'll be retiring at the end of December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5515.59s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=5517.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9040.197s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9042.538s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9044.179s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that this is similar to the question that was before this honorable body several years ago, and it was in-law apartments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9051.706s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at the time it presented itself, there were residents in the community that wanted to be able to have in-law apartments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9058.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There was a lot of pushback from the building department at the time and different boards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9064.965s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we have to find a direction where the body wants to go before we do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9070.489s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would suggest, like Councilor Marks, I think Councilor Knight may have said it, send this to the appropriate subcommittee and hash out, because I'd hate to say any work get done on it if there really isn't some direction as a result of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9085.82s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Councilor Knight is looking to start the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9088.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think there's merits both to and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9091.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for and against on the conversions itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9096.002s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Currently, right now, I don't know what the restrictions are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9098.824s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if you have to have separate boilers, separate meters, common areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9102.928s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are all good questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9104.289s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quite simply, this could be done just through the zoning, some of the zoning issues, I'm sorry, zoning restrictions as well, through the permitting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9113.416s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So we may not even have to do a total ordinance on it, but we could say, okay, you have to have a separate and distinct boiler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9118.601s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Another restriction is that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9121.11s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Minimum amount of square footage per unit is X. Minimum amount of bedrooms is X. There's a lot of different variables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9128.373s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would suggest, like Councilor Markshead and Councilor Knight, I believe, sending this to the housing subcommittee and discuss where at least we want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9136.656s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because quite honestly, I don't know enough about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9140.458s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that there's sometimes parking problems and stuff that may arise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9144.599s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if you have a two-family house now and you're renting it to a couple with a baby,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9149.783s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's no different than if that couple is paying a mortgage payment each month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9153.54s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for that same unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9154.361s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to have the same number of vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9157.964s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm looking at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9159.745s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I really don't see the advantages and the disadvantages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9163.448s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quite honestly, someone would maybe rather buy it so they can write off their interest on their mortgage payment per month rather than paying rent, which you can't write off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9174.937s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there's just so many different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9177.059s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think the appropriate place to vet this out and see where we're going is the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9182.49s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9183.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In Councilor Penta's question, that's a valid question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9186.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That could be answered that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9188.392s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: City solicitor might say, as you indicated, no, this can't be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9193.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then we can look at maybe restrictions, the separate boiler, the this, the that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9198.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I know there is some state laws I'm not 100% sure on, but water meters, I believe you have to have separate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9205.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: electric meter maybe, but I'd be only fooling all of us if I pretended to know what I'm talking about on this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9213.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just think we should vet this out at the appropriate subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9233.977s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9290.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9291.979s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9293.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With all due respect, if the young lady wants to discuss a topic, and that's her discretion, it's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9302.128s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To say that councillors should not discuss the topic that's brought up, I can't support that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9308.094s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is a city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9313.219s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a valid point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9316.202s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And with all due respect, this is an open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9318.424s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So anyone that wants to run for office can come right through that door, just as you did last election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9324.95s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, you can come down and discuss these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sEpbONopS5E&t=9415.57s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: While we're under suspension, if we can just acknowledge that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and many families within our community have dealt with that particular situation, and I think we should acknowledge that as a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=640.801s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just to clarify for Councilor Penta, they came before us on April 28th, and we tabled the matter pending<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=646.937s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the Board of Appeals as well as Mass State Lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=649.598s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's actually unfinished business still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1259.925s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1261.906s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Could Councilor Camuso?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1265.662s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you Mr. President and I'd just like to go on record in supporting this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1271.468s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is a long time business in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1274.771s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A lot of Medford people support the business and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1279.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They have been good neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1280.399s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I haven't received complaints regarding them over the years as a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1284.74s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And where it's going from one generation to the next, I think that they'll still continue the way the parents left off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1292.944s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if I know Mr. Wu, he will be having his thumb on the business as well, making sure you boys are keeping it as clean and as good a neighborhood establishment as he always has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=1305.189s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I will support this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2474.135s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Penta's concerns, but the liquor license is actually till 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2479.337s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The establishment closes at 11, but that particular liquor license is till 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2486.67s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2487.791s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2495.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It wasn't the way it came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2496.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2497.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2497.499s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Make sure we know what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=2906.112s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll yield to the gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3450.416s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3451.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I already said a little bit earlier regarding my support, but I'd just like to back up my support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3458.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm looking at this as somewhat of an economic development of the community as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3463.536s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just last week, there was some discussion regarding a sign and certain members of the council wanted to shut a sign off at the new Marriott that's coming to our community at certain times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3472.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was thrown out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3474.023s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at that point, I was a little concerned because I think we have to be, show that we're with the times, so to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3483.068s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I look back, I have another paper on later on this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3486.125s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to discuss another piece of economic development in our community that was not supported by the Medford City Council, other than myself and I believe Councilor Knight at the time, and that was the bank across from the Medford Fire Station for a drive-thru.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3500.551s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there was an arrangement, an agreement with all the neighbors in the area on Thomas<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3504.798s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that did not have the votes, and now we're sitting here with an empty building for over a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3509.281s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, I do have concerns of moving the city forward in the economic development piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3515.245s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, you know, as we look around the community, we have some great restaurants now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3518.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have Carroll's, who's not so much in a residential neighbourhood, but we have Razzo's and Bocelli's that are right in the heart of neighbourhoods very similar to Lambert Street area and Spring Street Extension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3531.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For some time, my wife and I owned a corner<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3533.854s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Irving Street in West Medford, which directly abuts West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3538.895s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And although we didn't have the late hours, we also knew when we moved in there, there was a potential for the Bistro 5 to petition for later hours and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3549.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, you know, I just look at this as an economic development piece for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3555.119s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, last week, too, there was some talk about parking, and certain people are for and against the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3560.061s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and I got the numbers from last week, the meals tax has actually been up by a good amount when I compared January 1st of 2014 to 8-31-2014, and then I ran the numbers for the same time period of 2015, throw in the worst winter we've had in probably the last 35 years in the city of Medford, and to have the meals tax up during that same period of time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3587.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and say that the businesses are suffering and lacking and are really getting hit because of the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3595.742s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It just didn't make sense and I wanted to take it to the next level and actually get data to back that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3600.764s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when I did that I was quite surprised because if you look back at the winter that we had, it was one of the worst winters in the history of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3616.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As far as this particular establishment, like I said, I can go along with the review, but I think we have to give them an opportunity to operate with the later hours if something happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3630.199s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand the gentleman that came up and talked about crime and the drugs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3633.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not sure where he went, but that's all over this community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3637.443s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We just hired the other day, the city of Medford hired the first time outreach coordinator to deal with the opiate problem that we're dealing with here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3645.31s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She was just hired within the last two days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3647.431s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so I think the city is doing our best to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3652.733s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think part of the problem you have in some of these areas at night is because at a certain time it's shut down and it tends to attract people that may want to do not so good things, whether it's in a parking lot in a vehicle or somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3667.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this will actually act as a deterrent from things of that nature with having a little bit more viability<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3675.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: going on at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3675.961s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I certainly understand the concerns of the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3679.043s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I certainly understand it, but I firmly believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3682.005s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you look at Mr. Karofalos, a gentleman that came here, it's the American dream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3686.689s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's worked hard his whole life, his whole life, and he owns that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3690.912s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He owns that building, he's a Medford resident, and he understands, he would be the last person that wants the neighbors that he's been next to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3699.228s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for all these years to have these problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3703.55s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just feel confident through the proper restrictions, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3710.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as far as the other things that the other gentleman mentioned, these are serious police matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3715.975s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if you see people drinking in the parking lot in vehicles, it's a serious issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3721.537s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But it's not something that's going to get any better or worse because of the permit that's before us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3728.507s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for those reasons, I just think that we should give them a shake and an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3735.094s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly, as I said last week, I just think Medford's getting the, and it's partly because of City Hall and this city council on occasion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3745.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People don't want to come to Medford as much as they want to go to other communities that are willing to listen, and to open the door, open the avenue, and be for new things, or move the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3757.192s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, we're at a very, very critical juncture in this community over the next 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3761.933s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have Mr. Wynn, who's breaking ground on a casino right over the line in Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3769.454s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the entrance and exit to that casino is going to be on the Charlestown side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3774.702s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there was a lot of misinformation at first that it was going to be at the circle over on this side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3779.905s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3781.726s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The case is it's going to be on the Charlestown side with a ramp coming from the highways and all that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3787.028s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If indeed the building permits are issued, which it appears it is, the last hurdle was taken up by Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3794.472s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But as I talk about the critical juncture, you know, I want to see people that have capital that want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3801.533s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: bring something vibrant to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3803.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to see them come here, because they know they have a city hall that wants to move Medford forward, whether it be in the corner office, whether it be department heads under the mayor's lead, whether it be the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3814.976s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we want to send the message that we want people to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3817.756s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have many lots on Mystic Ave that are going up for sale every few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3822.577s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3824.097s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to see more Marriotts come to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3828.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I said last week, when we start talking about the Marriott shutting their sign off at a certain time because the roast beef place next door has to do it, it's night and day as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3839.024s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's night and day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3840.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could send that vision, and I think this a lot starts in the economic development office, but as I said, we're at a very critical juncture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3849.143s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we're going to have opportunity because of that casino that we have never had in the last 50 years in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3856.348s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're going to have people that want to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3858.109s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're going to have people that go on the internet and see a room at the casino for $500 a night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3863.713s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OK, let me stay at the Marriott or the Sheraton on Mr. Gavin Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3867.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd rather see them here in our community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3869.944s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: than over in Chelsea or in Somerville or other areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3873.027s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, we've got to have vision like Mayor Curtatone, a vision of Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3877.331s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you go down there, whoever thought that legal seafood would be opened up on the Mystic River a quarter of a mile from the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3884.999s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Never in a million years I thought that was going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3887.762s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I certainly hear the neighbors loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3891.185s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you have specific police<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3893.42s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Police issues, if you could please either talk to one of the councillors after the meeting, or we'll get you in touch with the chief of police, because those issues aren't going away, whether you have them or every business in the community closed at 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3907.726s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Those issues are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3912.828s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, no, and I understand that, but we have to take the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3916.349s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can't make the permit become<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3920.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The permit's separate and distinct from the issues you're dealing with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3923.281s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just think that we have to police that area a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3928.285s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just think that we should give them a shake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3930.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know the councilor mentioned, what did you mention for a review, 60?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3932.829s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 60 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3934.27s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A 60-day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3935.351s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at that point, we can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3936.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if it's creating a major havoc, believe me, the chief of police will be the first one that will be down here petitioning the council to get rid of the license if it's going to create a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3946.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On my end, I'll just finish with saying this has come up before with RAZOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3951.122s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I remember the liquor hearing for RAZOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3953.663s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I remember other hearings for businesses of similar nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3956.784s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there hasn't been one of them that have been back before us to have the license pulled or anything as a result of the extended hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3964.768s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So with that being said, I just wanted to give a little bit more background on why I continue to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3972.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I would hope the council has the vision to at least give them the opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=3976.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with the full expectation that they stay to the high standards as their father and mother have done over the past 25, 30 years, as Mrs. DePaola indicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5242.83s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5245.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just wanted to let the gentleman know the chief of police and all the other department heads have signed off, and that's where they normally say they would concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5253.474s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Signed off on what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5254.674s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to give you the whole packet in two seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5256.815s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5256.955s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You can take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5705.894s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can we just let the gentleman speak first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5708.496s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's been waiting patiently at the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5950.884s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On the motion for tabling, at this point, I'm just going to take a little different stance, because I think we're charged with the responsibility to either vote this yea or nay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5960.547s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Obviously, it's a very, very nice neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5963.167s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Lambert Street has hundreds of people living on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5966.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have several residents here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5968.568s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I think in the best interest of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5971.742s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the whole city in that particular area, I'm ready to take a vote on it and with the reviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5977.624s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as far as tabling it, I just don't see anything coming out of it this evening, to be honest, because I don't think anything's going to be said that's going to say people, OK, do you have a few points?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5987.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5988.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'm going to vote no on the tabling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5990.369s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to vote no on the tabling for that matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5992.83s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we're charged to take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=5996.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: move it forward, because there are a lot of people that live in that immediate area that aren't here for them or against them, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6002.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6003.36s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6196.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are not the property owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6198.059s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are the business owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6199.059s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The property owners are in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=6201.06s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Oh, you just said property, so I just wanted to make sure we're getting apples to apples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7305.549s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7306.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7307.909s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this is a great, great resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7311.03s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I want to applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7314.791s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: City of Medford, 1-1-2015 to 8-31-2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7316.331s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Meals tax, $349,605.74 in meals tax for people participating in eating in our establishments in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7332.912s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If they get an abatement for a new business, in that case, a restaurant to come in, you give them something, an incentive to start up costs, basically, like other communities do, this goes hand in hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7348.042s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Like you said, urban renewal, development, it's what cities and towns are doing to get creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7355.947s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Look at Somerville, many, many, many years ago, 1980s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7357.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 1980s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7361.957s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was all these little establishments, and people got incentives to clean up and make it vibrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7370.36s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now you look at it, and it's a mecca of walking to all the different squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7376.801s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just, at the end of the day, Mr. President, if we give an incentive, just in this particular instance, say if it's a restaurant, you're going to make it up in the meals tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7388.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I understand what John's trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7391.334s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But at the end of the day, this is what's going to bring quality business here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7393.955s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's going to put people to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7395.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's going to continue to grow the tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7398.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's going to get a storefront that is currently maybe vacant, something in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7403.218s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's the intent of it, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7404.779s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7405.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I support this wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7407.039s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that this is a heaven vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7409.0s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm thinking outside the box, to be quite frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7410.861s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I do support Councilor Knight on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7718.174s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm glad Councilor Marks brought up Huff's Bakery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7721.609s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because interesting enough, Hoffs Bakery was before this Medford City Council for the TIF, which was a tax incentive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7729.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was not unanimous vote of this city council to give them, some people had the vision to see that they were gonna put, like Councilor Mock said, X amount of people to work, gonna clean up a development behind 9th Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7742.656s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was a program that became before the city council, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7746.465s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just another fact that this city council, and we're all entitled to our votes, there's no question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7753.728s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But check the record on it, it was not a unanimous vote of this city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7757.049s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And now, unfortunately, because Malden is offering them a tax incentive similar to what Councilor Knight is looking to do here, they are moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7765.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the TIF on the Hoffs Bakery was before this city council a few years back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=7770.774s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But thank you for bringing that up, Councilor Marksley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8103.363s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just want to wish Robert Emmons Carey Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8106.624s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good luck in his retirement and give him more time to be around the schools and helping out our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8513.484s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8515.125s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8517.147s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Tony Bova, just don't even know where to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8519.548s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I echo the sentiments of Councilor Penter and Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8525.252s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a great guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8526.973s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's kind of ironic, too, because we saw him at the community day a few weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8531.056s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He had the table for Medford Youth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8533.557s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when I was shooting the breeze with him, I says, hey, you look the exact same as you did as when I was a mite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8540.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He hasn't changed a wink.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8541.081s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's one of those guys that just looks the exact same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8545.146s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Lost a little hair, right, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8546.768s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Tony's just a great guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8548.75s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I played for him when I was a mite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8551.313s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I went right through, played at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8553.796s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he was always a big part of the high school team and high school athletics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8557.801s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it didn't stop with hockey, as the Councilor noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8560.866s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: started the figure skating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8561.947s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was under his leadership that girls hockey was started at the youth level, and then Councilor Lungo took over and got it initiated at the high school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8571.574s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But just a great guy, and I do support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8574.276s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And also to piggyback on what Councilor Penta said, there are other people that this council has looked to honor over some time, and maybe now the mayor can take some of those under advisement, and if he sees<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=8589.314s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: true that they're deserving, as this council has, to move forward with some of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9224.463s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: point of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9226.344s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know this year the big race is the mayor's race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9229.586s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So chairman Donato will be notified to come down on behalf of the democratic candidate, which is, well, I don't want to get into politics, but there's a democrat and a republican running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9240.532s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the republican individual who's here this evening, Mr. Capucci, will come down on behalf of the republican candidate for mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9247.236s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that how this works?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9285.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9384.341s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The next part of the questions was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9387.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It should be all candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9389.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It should be all 16, all 15, whatever it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9953.729s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand that we're asking questions here, but we haven't had these problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9962.567s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's never been a question of ethical standards during an election that I've heard of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9967.95s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just, I don't know, I'm getting a bad taste, almost like it's conspiracy theory here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9975.255s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand that we have to obviously make sure that the ethical standards are upheld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9983.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know of any particular situation that's leading up to these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9988.343s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If so, this should be brought not only to our clerk, but to the Secretary of State's office, who oversees the elections in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10017.877s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10020.819s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10021.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penta just said that all the Councilors should be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10024.701s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think you have to take it one step further, because that would be someone that's not a current Councilor may look at that and say, well, why can the Councilors be notified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10030.805s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would like to make a blanket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10032.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Everybody's notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10033.286s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Anyone that's going to appear on the ballot,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10035.767s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But no, you just said that the council is getting notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10037.688s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think you just didn't add to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10041.009s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I think that everybody that's appearing on the ballot in November, and I'm not one of them this year, with that being said, I think everyone should be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10053.072s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10097.063s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10099.404s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as people are coming back in, I think an arrangement was made for a 90 day at midnight and then the 91st day it would be the one o'clock if there's no problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10392.666s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10393.106s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10394.847s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10396.288s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And first off, I want to commend Councilor Marks because I really didn't see Kula Hedge prevailing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10402.132s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, nice job, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10405.374s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, a motion for approval for the first 90 days<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10411.53s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: open till midnight, the 91st day to the 365th day, 1 a.m., with a restriction of 11 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10420.656s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: karaoke stops, and that we ask the city to upgrade the lights in the parking lot, and when I say the city, that's the mayor, because he has the purse strings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10430.783s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's gonna be a separate issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10433.245s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We'll do that as a separate paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10434.326s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do it as a separate paper, so motion for approval with the conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10439.205s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the probation, the one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10441.026s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One year review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10441.727s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10443.388s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10444.089s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10445.149s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10447.031s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With the butters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10448.172s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Actual butters, not computerized butters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10475.881s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That won't be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10477.121s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You don't want to let people in that late, because they were there for obvious reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10480.083s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10481.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All the bars are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10483.273s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The bars in Malden and everywhere else, they shut the doors at a time before that, so they're not just getting the refresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10500.013s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10500.713s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If there's bouncers, the year review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10503.477s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10504.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If there's bounces, there may be a review before that year is up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10507.95s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10563.868s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And next year, they'll cater the fishermen's feast fire in the North End.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10731.727s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10733.248s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On this particular matter, if we could send the road renovations to the DPW Fort Worth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10738.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10738.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because over the next 30 to 45 days, there is major renovations going on in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10743.157s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just on that as well, ask that people be patient, because they're grinding down a significant amount of roads that they didn't plan on doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10751.043s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could ask for people's patience, because there's going to be a lot of roadwork going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=10755.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On that motion, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11401.273s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11402.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could send a request to the Building Commissioner to find out the status of the permits,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11409.782s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and everything else that goes along with that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11412.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the building right next to Tedeschi's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11416.865s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And what's the wedding place by the dresses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11421.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Teresa's boutique, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11423.989s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's been sitting vacant for quite some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11425.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There really hasn't been that much activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11427.71s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we can get an update, and if they don't have an update, if they can reach out to the developer and find out what's going on with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=11434.979s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=416.641s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=418.321s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd like to commend Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=423.302s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I do believe it's long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=425.403s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When this program first went into inception, a gentleman by the name of Don Ouellette at the time said that we would have similar software to detect leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=434.984s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And also that unnamed city engineer from a surrounding community who brings a wealth of knowledge to our community as a resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=443.286s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to commend her and thank her as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=446.262s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I support this wholeheartedly, and I think this is something that can't wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=451.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because just over the past few weeks, I know two people, one in particular with a water bill that went up about $1,000 in the water bill because of a leak in the lawn sprinkler irrigation system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=464.677s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It just kept going, going, and going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=466.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I do support this wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=468.34s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And once again, I'd like to thank Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1420.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1420.58s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And once again, I want to thank Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1424.704s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I do think it's, it's unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1426.786s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The timeframe, uh, as Councilor Knight alluded to, if you don't pay the ticket within 28 days, they start adding on fees and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1434.8s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To not have at least a hearing and go through the due process within a reasonable period of time, it definitely is a major issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1444.39s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I do know that this week, several people I've talked to, and I actually have one, I'll bring it next week, but received their decisions via email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1453.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're actually emailing the decisions to people to be environmentally friendly, or probably to save money, I'm sure, where it's the company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1460.64s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But people did get their adjudication notices this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1465.885s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Some people did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1466.525s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not sure when the appeals actually were made, but be interested to look at that data as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1474.451s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's probably a good time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1476.268s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: maybe in the month of October sometime to have a committee of the whole and just go over the whole program where it's ten months into inception and where we're at prior to getting to the winter months, find out what the plan is going to be to make sure that everything is shoveled out in a prudent manner before the first snowstorm comes and hits and then we're running around trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1499.182s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would like to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1501.535s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to ask that this be amended to have a committee of the whole meeting, uh, towards the middle of my middle of October, possibly, um, or anytime in October, next week, whatever, to, um, to just go over the whole parking program where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1515.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we can actually dig into all the reports that council and night just requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1519.944s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I do support the, uh, Councilor wholeheartedly as well as the amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1525.046s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1525.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as amended by council, Camuso council care of yellow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1557.026s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1558.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, I was able to track that back through my emails, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1562.409s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was a violation that was issued MDC 5482.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1565.09s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was issued on 8-15-2015 at 5-16 in the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1571.233s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that was turned around within a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1573.674s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there may be something going on with the specific ones in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1578.016s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the notice that someone sent to me saying that the adjudication and stuff took place, that is the date that the violation was issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1586.182s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: on the ticket in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1589.283s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm starting to think maybe that's one person that's not doing their job possibly, but we have to investigate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1597.186s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1597.906s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We need that report and we certainly need that committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2086.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just wanted to let the residents know the city of Arlington put out a press release last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2093.356s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going parking kiosks and meters, the entire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2097.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: City, Massachusetts Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2098.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right now they're in the parking lots and they're actually putting them out on Massachusetts Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2101.995s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're rolling it out according to the city manager in Arlington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2106.559s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, just as a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2314.794s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One week, we want to get out of the contract because it's broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2318.176s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This week, there's maybe recommendations to do stuff that was well within our right, like giving senior citizens passes where they're exempted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2328.862s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's make up our mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2330.423s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Are we either going to follow the contract or do within our right of the contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2334.826s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I wholeheartedly support giving senior citizens free parking privileges in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2339.969s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These people no longer have children in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2342.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These children, the senior citizens of our community, have made Medford great the way it is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2349.027s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to sit here and go against something that's positive and say that the company, the company, the company, I just feel that I think we have to do what's right by the residents and the city of Medford, not the company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2361.814s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not worried about the company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2518.918s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Also, it's my understanding in talking to the mayor, meters are going to be starting to pop up, the regular old-fashioned meters that Medford Square had back in the 80s within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2532.71s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's going to be the regular standalone meters that Chris alluded to, where you just throw the quarter in, and those are going to be starting to get sprinkled around the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2544.339s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The elephant in the room here is twofold as far as I'm concerned with the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2548.564s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to just get out of this pocket, and it's going to cost us, as of today, $1.1 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2551.665s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: $1.1 million to get out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2553.086s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2580.465s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, if I may, um, the evening that the business owners were at our meeting, when this council voted seven to nothing to send out the, um, to negotiate with Republic parking, it was a seven to nothing vote of the Medford city council that evening and included in that was kiosks and meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2599.715s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: clearly in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2600.595s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There was businesses throughout the community that came up that evening and made mention that they would like to have regular meters in front of their stores.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2607.458s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know several in West Medford, several in Medford Square have approached the city, would be interested in having the quarter meters in front of their business because it's the type of business where you're just running in in one quarter and rather than going to the kiosk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2620.763s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So with that being said, like I said a few minutes ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2625.112s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To get out of it and wipe this out totally, it's $1.1 million as of today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2630.794s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: $300,000 in estimated receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2698.993s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unfortunately, I think the council is confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2701.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's $300,000 that was in our fiscal year budget that we're operating right now, estimated receipts from this parking program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2709.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you take the $800,000 that's amortized for the actual equipment plus the $300,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2715.508s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that is in estimated receipts, minus a quarter of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2719.429s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So rather than 1.1 million, it's probably around 1 million, say, to buy it outright right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2726.39s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To say that the city council did not support it, we supported it on two occasions, seven to nothing vote, seven to nothing vote, loud and clear, it has to be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2735.372s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The mayor did have a thing with that, that it came back to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2739.833s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We met in this council office over here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2743.119s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: before the mayor signed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2744.38s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know the exact date, but we met in that council office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2747.583s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Some of the people that are in the room this evening were at that meeting as well as a lot of other businesses throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2754.309s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The place was jammed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2755.651s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was packed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2756.211s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We were actually going to move the meeting into the council chamber, but we couldn't because there was another meeting going on in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2761.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, it was a seven to nothing vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2763.518s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's seven to nothing vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2819.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, Councilor Cusack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2821.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Like I said, the records of the Medford City Council don't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2824.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was a seven to nothing vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2825.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People can pretend they didn't vote for it, did vote for it, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2828.3s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not gonna argue any more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2829.581s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was seven to zip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2830.961s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Anyone can go down to the city clerk's office, see the minutes of that particular meeting in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2835.563s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was seven to nothing vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2837.403s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It only needed five votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2839.804s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe it might have needed five or four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2842.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not really sure because it was for up to 10 year contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2845.946s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Seven years up front, three years in the rear if the city decides to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2851.794s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: renegotiate up to three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2853.955s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it was a seven to nothing vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2856.076s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he mentioned the council resolution numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2858.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Anyone out there that's watching can go down to the city clerk's office and see the vote of the council was unanimous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2863.721s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, that's a really, you can't, you can't beat the dead horse anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2868.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was a seven to nothing vote of the Medford city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2871.445s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was actually one of the few times that we're actually all unanimous behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2876.988s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As we know, we often vote, um, our separate ways and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2880.192s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was one that everyone supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3034.754s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3038.535s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Based upon the reports that we got from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue as well, as recent as a couple of months ago, the sales and meals tax has jumped dramatically from last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3051.177s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So unless the price of meals is double or whatever is going on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3055.658s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's actual statistical data from the Department of Revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3328.109s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The Press Jimmy, just so you know, the number I'm basing it off of is the revenue that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3333.164s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The city of Medford gets back from the Department of Revenue based upon the sales of male's tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3340.888s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I can bring, I got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3342.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe not your business, I'm talking citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3344.329s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll get you the numbers, I'll bring them in your store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3357.776s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll get last year's and this year's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3360.551s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: every month, state, for my business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3362.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I can print.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3363.714s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm just talking citywide, Jimmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3366.195s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There might have been more restaurants that started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3369.258s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4167.763s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4170.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I have to agree with my council colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4172.578s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The traffic is starting to get pretty rough down there, especially during the commuting hours, five o'clock early in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4182.145s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The fact of the matter is this is a state, Department of Transportation is overseeing this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4187.489s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I asked for the MBTA to come forward with a solution within the last three months or so, I believe it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4194.774s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We still have not heard back from them on that particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4199.378s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But it's obvious that something has to be done because people shouldn't be expected to wait for a bus and be breathing in the debris, whether it's jackhammering and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4213.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I think something has to be done, whether it be temporary or a more permanent solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4219.912s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But definitely something has to give on this particular situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4224.115s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could have them in to discuss this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4227.31s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Also to discuss some of the express buses that so many Medford residents in this community rely upon to get to work every day into Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4237.564s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're the subject right now of privatization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4241.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with the MBTA, and I'd like to just get a status on where they're going and if the service is going to be as good, because quite honestly, I think the 326 and the 325 bus operated right now does a tremendous, brings tremendous value to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4258.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4262.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's packed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4263.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The express buses are packed every single morning going into Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4267.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'd like to hear their plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4269.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe I'll put that on at a later meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4272.331s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a separate issue because the bridge is more time consuming now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4277.235s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I do support the councillor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4278.936s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm going to withdraw that at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4281.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm going to bring it forward in a later motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4883.937s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As a city, we're striving to bring in quality business and economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4887.739s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To tell a worldwide chain hotel that we can't have their sign lit up all the time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4895.134s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's no way I can support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4896.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I supported that, it would be one of the worst votes I've ever taken as a member of the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4937.915s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor— Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4941.856s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4943.437s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4944.477s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4946.798s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penta stated it's a like business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4949.779s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not a like business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4950.879s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One's a 24-hour lodging establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4952.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The other one is a roast beef joint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4955.18s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not a like business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5140.529s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm just a little bit...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5142.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: disturbed that the comments were made this evening regarding a hotel with the name Marriott on it that's looking to come in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5150.764s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're trying to entice business into this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5154.066s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a hotel right out here that faces 400 units of senior housing developments right behind City Hall here that's illuminated 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5165.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quite honestly, when the sign ordinance was written by members of the City Council over the last 30 years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5171.504s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's, I think, getting to the point where it's outdated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5175.747s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When a place like Meadow Glen Mall had to come before us a few years ago to have a sign that was basically comparable just to keep them in business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5184.251s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We got to have a vision moving this city forward, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5187.553s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to say that a 24-hour hotel that we want to see come here, I mean, the hotel is going to generate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5194.672s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: taxes every single evening, every time a room is occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5197.894s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The hotel is going to generate economic development as far as people spending their money at Kelly's Roast Beef, at all the stations landing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5207.799s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to be using stuff over and Somerville is going to benefit by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5211.941s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Medford Square possibly will benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5213.902s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the vision we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5215.283s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We need vision to do Medford Square over and to sit here and to talk about not giving a 24-hour establishment, marry it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5223.807s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, we're lucky that this didn't come up at the beginning of negotiations because a big company like Marriott may not even entertain coming here if they saw that we would even not entertain a sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5235.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the sign is not overly bearing on the neighbourhood at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5239.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quite honestly, there's more lighting coming off over here of the Hyatt right out back of our building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5246.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the interest of economic development and trying to move this city forward, I support this wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5251.889s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to be honest with you, I'm not going to support the six-month review, because I think it's done very tastefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5258.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a win-win for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5403.405s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just want to wrap up by saying, you know, we're at a very unique juncture here in our community of either moving forward or moving backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5410.411s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a big development coming right across the city line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5414.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's going to be known as the Winn-Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5418.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We want to let businesses like the Marriott know that Medford wants them to come here and negotiate with us in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5426.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and potentially build something on Mystic Ave or wherever they find a parcel of land that may be good for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5434.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because it has to be good for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5436.74s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just don't want to send the wrong message out there and have businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5441.381s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because I've heard over the years, over the last 30 years in this community, people have been... People... I want to choose my words correctly and be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5452.89s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have heard that people feel uncomfortable sometimes when they come before some bodies here, particularly the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5460.293s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just think that in fairness for economic development views and where we're going with our neighboring community, I think we're at a juncture where we just have to show that we want to move the city forward, whether it be liquor licenses, whether it be hotel establishments, whether it be restaurants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5481.118s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think we're at a great juncture to move the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5484.36s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly, I just want to send the right message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5487.061s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that Councilor Knight took the words out of my mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5489.102s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I do support the sign, naturally, but not the review at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5493.904s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's done tastefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5495.085s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could just sever it and then move on with the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6322.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can ask a motion to get the update as Councilor Marks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6326.977s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6327.737s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So on the motion of Council Mark seconded by Councilor Musil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6377.892s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Send that to DPW, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6419.746s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just FYI, the sidewalks, massive sidewalk<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6426.405s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The plan that's been in the works is going to be taken off within the next two weeks or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6431.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're waiting for that second bid to come in and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6433.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if you notice, a lot of them are actually getting dug out right now by the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6437.134s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6437.735s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you'll see them actively doing a lot of sidewalks over the next, until it gets cold out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=288.721s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like to move suspension of the rules for item 15-616 and also the paper in relative to the Garden Club Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=362.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Move approval on the appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=364.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we could do two papers after this that are relative to the Medford Housing Authority under suspension<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=372.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: while the representative is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=516.352s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=518.268s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, congratulations on your appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=521.51s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the most important appointment, I think, on that board, because it brings a perspective from the tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=529.254s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We often hear complaints, but I've been getting a considerable amount of more complaints recently, just to name a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=537.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Tempone Manor recently just had a pretty nasty assault down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=540.719s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's the ongoing drug problems in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=546.494s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's people drinking out on the steps of Canal Street when people are traversing the neighborhood, and this is public housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=553.042s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Willis Ave, all you have to do is pick up the police blotter each week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=557.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and see some of the problems that are ongoing down there and walk on court as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=562.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are quality of life issues, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=565.658s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quality of life issues that will affect the senior citizens down here at our high rises in Medford Square, as well as Bradley Road and all the other units that are under the authority and jurisdiction of the Medford Housing Authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=577.56s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that the leadership, as far as the executive director and the board, have to really get involved with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=586.706s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and get their hands around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=590.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Not to get too much into specifics, but one of the situations with a recent assault, another assault took place with the same people a year or two ago, and they're still living there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=604.46s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are our senior citizens and our residents that deserve a better quality of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=609.203s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could just ask the Executive Director to issue a report to us on what he's doing to clean up these housing developments, it would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=617.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2430.076s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2430.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, the first thing is, um, if you'd allow me just to briefly discuss the $10,000, this is money that's coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2440.563s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's going to be user fees slash money from the gardeners to cap it at $3,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2446.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If they're putting their own money into this revolving account, which is not appropriated through the city budget process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2451.455s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't see why we should be capping it at $3,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2454.356s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We should give them at least the $10,000, the same that the artists are allowed to spend at a bare minimum, the same that the parks and recreation has in a revolving account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2465.76s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But to limit it, I don't see that being proactive for this startup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2471.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd also like to make an amendment if the council is amenable to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2475.293s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The amendment that the city solicitor made to have the Riverbend Park not part of this, I would think it would be prudent for this council to do it for three calendar years after the start-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2489.28s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At some point, they should not be running their separate and distinct operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2493.662s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It should encompass under the Garden Club, I'm sorry, the Garden Commission at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2499.464s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Lasky and that crew has done a phenomenal job down there, but I just have a hard time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2505.235s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: keeping one entity separate and distinct in the long term in the city where everything else is going to fall under this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2514.51s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's similar to a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2515.532s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can't say, well, all the schools are going to fall under the school committee except one school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2519.789s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're going to keep that under the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2521.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It just doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2523.092s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Would the city administration be amenable to a three-year phase out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2528.296s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So your amendment to make it so that the Riverbend Park is not part of this, that it would not be part of this for the initial three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2538.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: After three years, which is 36 months from now, they will become part of this ordinance as of that effective date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2577.718s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But we also could put the language that effective upon its passage that that particular portion expires on a specific date, 36 months from the date of passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2586.384s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just don't think it's fair, to be quite honest, and I think that the people that are already at Riverbend Park should have the opportunity to continue, but at some point, it should encompass all of the gardens in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2631.635s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unfortunately, it's, um, the paper before us is your amendment that you added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2636.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, unfortunately it's the vote of the council this evening, which will send it back to the mayor for enactment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2641.399s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I, as one member of the council, uh, I just can't, um, I just have a hard time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2646.995s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: segregate in one current garden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2648.356s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I appreciate everything that they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2650.636s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's why I'm giving them, I think, reasonable as three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2654.778s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then they'll come under the auspices of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2658.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just look at all the parks in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2660.681s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we take one park away from the park board and now call it a separate park,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2665.058s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It just doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2667.0s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2668.741s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm going to make that motion in whatever way it goes that we either suspend it or give them 36 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2676.106s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I feel more comfortable doing it with the 36 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2678.788s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I disagree with the city solicitor in this particular matter, because language is written all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2683.212s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Matter of fact, we go back to the mills tax that was done here, and we put a date on it where the mills tax would be reviewed after several years and come back to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2694.722s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It happens all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2696.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At the state level, the MBTA now has a control board, and it expires certain regulations within the control board, expired at a certain date upon the effective passage of the legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2707.285s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I respectfully disagree with the solicitor in this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2710.826s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that we can do it upon its passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2713.667s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's 36 months from the date of its passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2716.087s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just think it's in the equity of fairness and just doing the right thing for the future gardeners that are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2779.072s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the city council has the right to either accept it, amend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2782.753s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We've made other amendments this evening, uh, to the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2786.155s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, with all due respect, if the mayor's paper, um, I think there's a fairer way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2791.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to make that amendment and whatever way my colleagues see fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2794.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2795.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So an amendment that upon the effective passage of this paper, that the garden club at river Bend park, uh, stays separate and distinct for 36 months from the date of its passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2806.192s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then at that point, the 37th month, it would fall under the domain of the Garden Commission, which, and quite honestly, I hope Riverbend Park helps this commission, because they've done a fabulous job down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2818.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is an incentive to make the whole thing work by including them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2822.867s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I make that amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4368.581s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4370.782s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What the candidate for office fails to recognize is this is still public property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4374.993s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this was citizen-driven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4376.454s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is public property that the mayor is responsible for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4379.616s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If someone falls in that garden, they're not going to the five members of the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4384.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to see Mark Rumley for a suit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4395.725s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Without this commission, without this commission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4398.972s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's no rules in place to make sure that there's fair and equitable access to the gardens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4404.314s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, the city has a stake at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4406.194s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If someone doesn't feel they're being fairly treated, they can go down here and see Diane McLeod.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4411.356s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is fairly simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4412.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is something good for our community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4690.216s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4690.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I want to thank Mr. Patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4692.879s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is it Patrick for coming up, but, uh, I'm going to keep the amendment there, I think 36 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4698.883s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, and quite honestly, if this doesn't work in 36 months, the audience is going to be out the window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4703.227s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's not going to, it will be moved and you guys will still operate your garden off to the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4708.05s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So like I said, I just think it's the equity that has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4713.415s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And like I said, I cannot appreciate Mr. Lasky and his group, what they've done up to this point, because it wouldn't be realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4722.242s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I don't even remember starting a revolving account for Riverbend Park way back when, when it started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4730.937s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's not even public records as far as how much money comes in and out and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4735.438s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think that 36 months is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4738.839s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll even, for the gentleman's sake, I'll even go out 48 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4743.56s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Give them four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4744.561s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that's more than reasonable until it all becomes one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4751.883s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If the council, 48 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4755.284s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, I'll do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4755.924s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll withdraw the 36 months and 48 months, which is four years from the date of its passage,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4766.019s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It comes down to equity, I mean, and you can't have different organizations running different public properties when it all falls under similar data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4847.889s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I respectfully disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4848.929s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't think this is a legal decision, as the city solicitor stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4851.932s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the past, this is more of a parliamentary procedure, which would fall under the domain of the president of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4858.817s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn... No, you didn't answer that in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4865.222s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the past, clearly because this is the mayor's paper you're answering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5108.588s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5108.808s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, if I may, I know my resolution failed, but at this point, I'm going to, in the interest of having a unanimous vote for something good in our community, I'm going to vote with the rest of my council colleagues to include the language amended by the city solicitor, presented before the body by Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5128.433s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If the record could reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5130.034s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5130.654s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6848.022s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6849.003s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6850.184s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This program originally, I don't want to talk about the program, but the parking enforcement was initiated by the businesses and residents that couldn't get parking spots in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6860.152s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You drove through the square a year and a half ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6862.814s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Every business owner was parked all day in front of their store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6866.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Matter of fact, some of them were so blatant, they had their vehicles leaded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6869.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You couldn't go in and get an ice cream, or you couldn't go in and get something to eat, or your nail's done, or this or that, because they were parked in front of their businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6878.962s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think what we're losing sight of is a business permit is just that, it's a business permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6884.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I can assure you, when the days of the Cambridge Courthouse was open, you could buy a permit, but if you weren't there by seven o'clock, the cone would be in front of the garage, and you'd be riding around, feeding the meter until midday, and then you'd come out and move your car during your breaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6899.197s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So a permit is no way guaranteeing a spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6902.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand you'd like to park in front of your place all day with a business permit on the window, and that sounds easy, but the consumers need these places to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6911.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's what we heard from the businesses in Medford Square,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6914.704s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and throughout this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6916.885s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Perhaps you misunderstood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6921.406s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6922.167s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You want to park on the street with a business permit for as long as you're going to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6925.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's basically what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6932.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But as I said, a business permit is a permit only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6936.892s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You can have all the permits in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6938.212s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You go to Davis Square and you park behind the Davis Square T Station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6944.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you have a permit, you have to get there early, and you have to be there in time so there's a spot available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6948.611s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Otherwise, you wait outside the garage, you see a car pull out, and then you can pull in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6952.392s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, I sympathize with you, but the fact of the matter is, this is where this was all generated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6957.173s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was by the business community, it was by the people that wanted to utilize the squares that couldn't because of the business owners parking in front of their squares all day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6964.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we do the simple solution that you're suggesting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6967.573s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Why don't we throw the parking out, you can park in front of your business all day, and then the consumers won't have a place to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6973.018s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's where we came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6975.622s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, that's where we came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7005.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay, well that's something we can take care of, and the Chief just heard that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7008.639s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with all due respect, when you say I want to minimize it, that's not the case, because you're talking to someone that's father, owned a drugstore in Winchester Center for 25 plus years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7019.323s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And let me tell you, he had a business sticker, but if there wasn't a spot available, he took the gamble, and it was up to him to either pay a ticket or go home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7027.886s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He certainly wasn't going home and shutting the door on the drugstore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7030.922s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He certainly wasn't doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7032.603s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the fact of the matter is, sometimes with his bad heart, he'd have to park up near Stop and Shop and walk a little bit, or he'd have to park on Church Street and walk a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7040.067s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, I understand your frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7042.088s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the easy solution of just parking in front of the businesses on the street, that's why we're into this over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7048.931s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's not sugarcoat it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7049.972s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's why we are into parking enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7058.216s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, you're asking to park on the street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7124.685s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and Councilor Robert M. Penta, you were afforded that opportunity, as well as you and you and you and you and you and me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7131.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that is the lot behind St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7132.847s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Joseph's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7133.727s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The Chamber of Commerce worked diligently with this city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7136.108s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If people don't want to walk across the bridge to get to their business, then I just, it's a catch-22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7142.049s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a catch-22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7143.45s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People, people now can get a spot when they go to the doctors in Governor's Ave and Bradley Road, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7150.188s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, this was emanated when people were parking in front of their businesses year after year with names on their vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7158.813s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, if you see that, you should be calling the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7160.674s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Or call me, and I'll call the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7166.518s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7167.659s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7168.479s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know you were conversing with the chief out there, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7171.021s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Did you tell the chief that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7172.822s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, because I understand you, in your business, you've got to carry probably briefs and things of that nature, boxes to court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7184.609s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I wish I did, but I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7186.47s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And listen, I sympathize with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7187.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But at the same token, it was the Chamber of Commerce and the businesses that pushed this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7191.974s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Believe me, this is what we all hear the calls about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7194.716s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a happy medium out there somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7198.439s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm here to advocate for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7200.281s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7201.802s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, the mayor, as you know, is the contract negotiating authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7209.189s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You should be speaking with him regarding this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7211.21s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can bring the message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7217.153s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, you being a former elected official should understand that the council is a legislative body and not the administrative authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7224.076s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7224.636s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're not the executive in in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7227.057s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know at least one candidate has a plan for parking that was in the newspaper a few weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7232.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So we'll see what happens in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7234.201s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But at least for now, I would suggest that you contact the mayor's office and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7239.294s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to demand to see him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7240.535s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You pay enough in taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8159.914s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The rules clearly state that commuter parking, now Councilor Marks brought up a very valid point that they may be selling them to out-of-towners, but according to the policy and the rules,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8171.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 100% of commuter passes are Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8174.459s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to take their parking privileges away, I don't support that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8180.661s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8181.062s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a thought process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8427.178s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8427.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8433.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8438.107s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8439.688s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I got to agree with Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8443.792s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm looking at this realistically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8446.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't have to yell and scream about it because it's not a campaign year for me, unlike everyone else that's sitting in this room tonight, a lot of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8453.258s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I look at it and try to look at it realistically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8457.861s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A year and a half ago, at four in the afternoon, if I wanted to go and take my son for an ice cream in Medford Square, I wouldn't have been able to get a spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8466.985s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would have drove around four or five times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8469.587s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that's realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8470.787s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think most people agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8472.808s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People are nodding their heads in the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8475.725s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I look now, a year later, with the inception of this program, I can't remember the last time I had to drive around to go get that same ice cream at four o'clock in today's parking program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8491.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is it culture shock, having to pay to park in the city of Medford, which hasn't had meters since the 19, I'm not even sure what year, but you look at the old photos, they had them in Medford Square in front of Stagliano's liquor store,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8504.213s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Sure Pharmacy at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8505.354s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They came out in 1982.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8506.275s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They came out in 1982.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8509.097s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So from 82 to 2014, it slowly built up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8514.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there wasn't a need for it in the 90s because there wasn't as many cars on the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8518.706s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There wasn't as much cars in each household.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8523.29s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the development has been more throughout the city too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8526.192s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Not particularly in the squares, but on the outer edges of some of the areas, there's been more development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8533.306s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Other than paying to park in the enforcement piece, I think the consumers are happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8540.351s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I've got to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8542.592s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Other councillors may get 200 calls about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8546.435s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I haven't got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8547.295s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At first, it was culture shock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8548.876s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I was getting the calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8550.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I was getting the calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8551.558s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Matter of fact, I'd like to see someone's call log.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8557.046s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Someone's call log of all the calls they're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8559.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Black out the names, because I quite honestly don't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8562.167s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't believe when people are saying they're getting 200 calls, 300 calls about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8565.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't add up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8567.488s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't add up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8569.209s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, Mr. President, I understand people are still getting used to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8574.49s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I understand that wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8577.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But when some businesses say they're down 8% to 12%, I have other businesses<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8584.052s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I have no reason to not tell the 100% truth, that say this is the best thing that ever happened to their numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8593.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now we may shop in different places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8595.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe some people tell me what I want to hear, tell another Councilor what they want to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8599.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'm telling you, I have been told this by businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8601.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not making it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8603.017s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not making this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8605.358s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The fact of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8607.603s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is more consumer-friendly in one aspect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8610.045s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not consumer-friendly because you have to pay now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8612.526s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not business-friendly because you can't park your car in front of the business all day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8616.188s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there's also businesses out there that are happy with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8619.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're happy with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8621.592s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This chamber has not had over 50 people in it in one night regarding the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8627.335s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8628.236s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8628.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a city of 60,000 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8631.197s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 60,000 people live in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8635.622s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If the councillors get the 300 calls that they say they do, if they actually get 300 calls, God bless them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8641.766s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's still less than 1% of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8645.549s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8646.79s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, like I said, I just, I don't hear the complaints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8650.132s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I hear the young, and it's funny too, because the same people, and I bring this up when the drive-throughs come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8658.327s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The same people now are stopping at these businesses because there may be parking where before they'd drive an extra three miles, drive by two Dunkin' Donuts or two banks to go to the one with the drive-thru because they couldn't find a spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8668.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They didn't want to get out of the car and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8669.949s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, so obviously there's some people that are happy with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8674.11s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's some people that are not happy with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8675.85s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But that's just through my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8677.571s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, I'm given a fair synopsis of what I see out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8682.432s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I haven't heard the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8683.918s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, I can give you probably 50 emails of people that have complained about it over the six or seven months, but I'm just going by what I've experienced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8693.403s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And like I said, I don't have to give a speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8697.124s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8697.745s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm off into the sunset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8699.206s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good luck to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8701.026s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm just telling you what... I'm just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8706.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, with all due respect, Val, Val, we're cleaning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8709.214s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not even going to get into the parking lot mess over there in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8712.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, Mr. President, with that being said, Mr. President, I'm giving a brief synopsis of what I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8723.397s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's just one city councilor out of seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8727.358s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know there's other councilors here that have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8731.196s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Got some of the same feedback because people have told them directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8733.978s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm not going to put them on the spot because it's not fair to do that if they don't want to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8738.121s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there is people out there that are very happy with this program, as well as not happy with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8745.906s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But more, I get positive feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10799.309s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, rather than, and I can understand where the council is coming from, but I don't agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10805.391s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would rather have that million dollars in the bank<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10808.171s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: collecting interest for the taxpayers, knowing that it's encumbered for a specific reason, which is the repayment of the loan, but at least have it in an interest-bearing account, which it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10822.215s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=73.553s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, move suspension of the rules to take three papers combined, 15-562, 15-563, and 15-568, and they all pertain to the Craddock Bridge construction project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2840.815s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, you're insulting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2968.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2970.352s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2971.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My first question is, is there going to be the temporary construction trailer up where people can actually take a look at the plans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2978.072s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there's people at home now that couldn't be here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2980.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do you plan on doing that or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3019.973s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3023.276s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3025.538s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, uh, I've taken upon myself to go to other communities that similar projects were done to see what the impact was on the downtown area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3032.684s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, one in particular was the town of Winchester, uh, similar project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3037.127s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it took about two and a half, three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3039.229s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it got cut down to one lane, most of the, um, project and, uh, the businesses, other than the fact that it was a pain in the neck to traverse the area,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3048.087s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with police detail, stopping the traffic, that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3050.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They said as far as the impact on their businesses, they really didn't see much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3055.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just the ones that I happened to talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3058.152s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, are there any projects that you've done similar to this one in the general vicinity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3089.201s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3090.342s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, the second thing, um, I have a question about is the, uh, the maritime conditions and the locks and things of that nature because, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3098.655s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The boating community is concerned about the locks being opened and manipulated for this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3105.277s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do you know if there's going to be an impact on the riverway, as far as that goes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3113.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, not the locks here, but the Amelia Earhart Dam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3115.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is the water level going to stay the same and everything, or are they going to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3145.614s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that leads up to my next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3146.955s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The DCI vote can certainly help out your cause by slowing the flow up at the upper and mystic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3153.222s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: lakes because that's brand new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3155.424s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was done over in the past few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3157.425s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Members of the DOT that are here, I'm sure, are familiar with that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3162.088s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's actually good that that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3163.91s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And interesting enough, the Winchester Bridge was a result of some of their downtown flooding problems as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3171.435s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's a lot of moving parts to this whole project that we don't necessarily see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3176.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The other thing is I'm confident that the direct abutters will be appropriately represented given the fact that you're putting the monitoring systems in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3188.593s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I would hope that they all take part in it and have an independent insurance person take a look at their conditions prior to this process starting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3199.637s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And last but not least, Councilor Pentland hit on it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3203.162s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but the environmental impact on the river.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3206.904s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a lot of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3208.064s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As you said, the city has water lines under there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3212.306s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is there going to be any negative environmental impact during demolition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3216.988s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is there going to be booms set up and everything that contain everything right there, or netting under the bridge that's going to catch stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3222.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What's in plans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3263.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're going to lift these large pieces right out and set them on a truck and take them away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3268.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3269.262s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at any time does this job call for a barge under there as well to either rebuild or demo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3292.014s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My last question is just to follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3294.476s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Actually, from the drawings and the research that I've done with this particular project, going under the bridge there, it actually looks like it's going to be a lot better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3305.162s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Naturally, it's going to be more aesthetically pleasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3307.52s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but it's going to be more open and voluminous when you're on the west side of the bridge looking down river towards Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3318.486s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's actually going to improve the image in the sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3321.408s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know that's a very, that's a big area where a lot of people throughout the community utilize to take pictures, whether it's wedding pictures, this, this, this and that type thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3328.632s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's, it's more open right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3331.674s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People that haven't seen it or been up close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3334.548s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's only a small area where boats go through and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3338.07s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's going to be like the Longfellow Bridge almost, but much smaller, naturally, the arches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3351.537s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3354.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3355.659s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And last but not least, I know this is very nerve-wracking for residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3360.802s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, the traffic the last two days has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3364.044s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: very bad, but that was because of the Winthrop Street project going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3367.027s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's because, um, this project that's, that's just getting underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3370.991s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, um, I, I tried to look back to some of the complaints, um, that the city received years ago when they did the route 16 bridge over down near metal Glen mall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3381.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that was a bigger bridge and, um, it actually took, uh, took a substantial amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3387.867s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, uh, overall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3391.075s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It wasn't directly in the business community, but it was close enough that it could have an adverse effect on the Metal Glym Mall and Century at the time, and Mystic Valley Tower was north.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3400.079s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But it was pretty good overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3404.321s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that was the Department of Transportation slash DCR joint venture at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3409.124s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm confident that if we all work together that this can be done, and it has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3417.387s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's the part that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3419.013s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: people are failing to realize throughout the square and throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3422.494s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If this doesn't happen now, the price is just going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3426.476s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And inevitably, there could be someone resulting in injury or fatality down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3432.179s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, when they're putting up yellow caution tape for people not to walk over a bridge, something has to be done or cordoning off certain areas of a bridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3441.102s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is being done for public safety and no other reason, quite honestly, because I know the state wouldn't want to be spending the money either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3447.558s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: if it didn't need to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3449.439s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I want to thank you for your presentation and look forward to working with you on this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9323.049s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion to take 15-460, the fiscal year 2016 budget, off of the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10999.081s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank you as well as Mayor McGlynn as he presents his final budget to the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11008.587s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Once again, this is a budget that is going to provide city services at a level that I think is sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11016.832s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I've been a member of this council when times were really, really tough and when times were really, really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11024.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right now, we're basically at a point or a juncture that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11028.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Things in the city are moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11030.571s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm proud to say that that was a collaborative effort, Mayor McGlynn and the city council, the school committee, the superintendent, and all the magnificent department heads and employees that we have here in this very building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11046.741s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But as I get ready to vote on Mayor McGlynn's final budget favorably, and I'm only one of seven members,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11055.818s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One thing that did stick out to me was the statistics on the parking program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11059.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it looks roughly about there's about 34 to 33,000 transactions at the meters throughout our community a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11070.885s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's a pretty impressive number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11076.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when you go to look at the citations and the citations collected, the number seems to be going down in the last few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11083.298s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think that's another interesting piece of data that we were presented from Mayor McGlynn and his staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11093.997s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, this is a good solid budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11097.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm very, very happy that the mayor agreed with this honorable body and funded the substance abuse prevention coordinator for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11108.303s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a position that is much needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11112.624s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think everyone on this council supported it when I first brought the idea forward and the mayor took it to one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11122.523s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One step further, another level, and he made it a full-time position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11126.006s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So certainly, I'm proud of that, and I think that that's a legacy on this entire council, because we initiated it here, and hopefully it's going to be a position that turns out to be a lifesaver when people are ready to utilize the person that's awarded that job in the very near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11145.901s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I think the school department budget is a very solid budget, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11150.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The superintendent pointed out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11152.83s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the money that's being spent in maintenance and in repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11157.453s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The superintendent also pointed out that the lump sum checks or the lump sum raises that some were saying were $60,000, a significant amount of money, were actually bonafide employment opportunities where people took new positions, is that correct, superintendent, that were publicly posted and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11179.397s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So just to clear up some of the confusion on that, because I get some phone calls from people in the school department saying, where did these jobs that are referred to on TV, where are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11191.905s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so I'm thankful the superintendent gave us that in-depth report as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11197.729s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, I think that this is a solid budget, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11201.911s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I was prepared to vote on this budget last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11207.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: after the final budget deliberations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11209.382s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, Louise, you did a fabulous job on your first budget, your first of many budgets, hopefully, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11216.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Either that or you'll be doing purchasing, I guess, because you have your contract as our purchasing agent for the next several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11223.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, like I said, we're at a juncture in our community right now, Mr. President, where we're, in a very short period of time, the faces and names of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11236.236s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A lot of elected officials in this community are going to be changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11239.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's factual at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11241.82s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's really a good opportunity to keep the city stagnant and moving backwards or forward or wherever the voters may see fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11249.986s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And with that being said, I think that this is a solid, solid budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11254.91s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11256.151s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And hopefully it gets voted on favorably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11259.293s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the personnel throughout the community can get back to work tomorrow knowing that the budget is in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11266.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I really don't have anything else to say about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11270.09s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I want to thank the department heads, and particularly Louise Miller, Superintendent Belson, and Mayor McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11277.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, he's been around, and this isn't a Mayor McGlynn, Ra-Ra speech at all, but he's been around when times were tough around here and when times were good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11286.236s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the city services were always a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11291.598s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the city services, where they are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11294.52s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 28 years ago and a lot added and not cut back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11299.942s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for that, and it was really good to always support a budget too with no trash fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11306.925s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Like our neighboring community of Malden, we were still able to get through another budget cycle without that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11311.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's a lot of positive stuff happened over the past couple of years under Mayor McGlynn's watchful eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11319.771s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12344.936s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are all proposals that were brought<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12349.564s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: through the chain of command, and ultimately the decision was made with Mayor McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12354.526s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If he wanted him in the budget, he would have put him in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12360.249s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is, and just, I'm going to wrap up, but it's kind of ironic because the council wants to keep adding to the budget, adding to the budget, adding to the budget, but every time we have a paper before us to add something good, he votes against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12374.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's, it's just, I'm finding it kind of ironic right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13424.006s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13427.368s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I assume, as in years past, this will be funded out of the water and sewer account with a vote of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13435.974s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is very much done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13437.616s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's rudimentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13438.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's done all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13439.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's been done in years past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13552.0s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13553.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One thing that anybody that's a good manager would look at at this point would be if there's been any changes in the system that we've used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13564.362s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there's been a major change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13566.123s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: as a result of this council advocating for a tiered rate system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13570.766s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The tiered rate system started how long ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13577.731s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's, I'm assuming where we don't know where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13583.635s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13584.156s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13585.127s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's a direct result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13586.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is Management 101.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13588.128s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is something that we have to learn from this because we don't know at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13592.55s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't know at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13594.01s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm very comfortable knowing that we've funded this in the past out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Accounts, which has certain regulations and standards that the money can be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13605.434s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is certainly an appropriate use when necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13608.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But to say that it's 117,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13612.83s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I assumed right off the bat it was because of the tiered rate system, and that's why I wanted to pose the question to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13620.853s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13664.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we only have authorization to cut the budget, not line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13748.128s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, if I may, this particular line item, I don't feel comfortable reducing it at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13758.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That money that's in the budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13760.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: could be used at a later time for other accounts if the city council sees fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13767.317s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Money from the water and sewer enterprise accounts could not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13770.199s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So let's say we have another real bad year, like we've had this last winter, where the snow and ice was outrageous, just based upon the climate that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13781.346s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right now, when it's in the budget, it can be used to offset the snow and ice, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13785.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It cannot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13786.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It cannot, even if it's the budget line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13812.224s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13812.524s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13814.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the wrong understanding on the budgeted side of things compared to the account that the money is in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13818.907s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13819.368s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13820.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was, I apologize for misspeaking on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13824.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I still, the tiered rate system, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13829.775s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We've advocated strong for it, this council, and we may have to make up money on the water side because of the assessment with this new tiered system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13838.337s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, we got the answer from Mr. Kamara, who gave us a very detailed response last week in our packets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13845.378s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'd just like to sever those votes, that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14461.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's going to cut the budget and then vote against the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14470.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14472.643s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Couldn't run a lemonade stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14501.567s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A yes vote is to strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14504.088s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A no vote is to leave it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14505.508s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14505.768s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14506.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14507.569s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14507.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14508.57s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14509.33s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14529.819s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What was the roll call on that, on the first item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14532.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 4-3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14534.561s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 4-3, and it failed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14609.382s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14721.472s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the outreach coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14725.408s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We just voted for the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14727.209s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We got it earlier today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14730.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, maybe you just didn't keep up to the times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14732.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just got it tonight, Paul, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14734.674s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, we all got it earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14736.415s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're the only one that always has problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14870.154s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Same as Ernest Lindsay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14988.959s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The job is going to be filled very, very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15129.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15142.838s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's already in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15174.322s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We've all been advocating for this, putting it off for longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15177.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, the overdoses just keep going up and up and up in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15185.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hey, I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15186.588s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the fact of the matter is, it's a position that we all advocated for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15259.637s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Council has been sitting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15266.503s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: June 16th, we've been sitting on it, dishonorable bodies since June 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15292.637s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But we don't approve job descriptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15294.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're overstepping our boundaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15297.3s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Job description is administrative role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15300.202s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15300.822s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you guys don't want to support it, don't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15304.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15306.065s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, that's the only role we have is putting it in their classification personnel table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15315.945s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Take the vote if you don't want to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15433.246s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Of course it can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15441.588s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn asked to this be tabled until we got the description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15449.469s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's how we're at now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15519.264s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15520.545s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As we all know, the city- I have a point of order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15525.707s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Talk about it next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15531.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15536.052s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Villion won't have his TV station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15885.779s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if the Councilor may have forgot, but didn't we as a council vote on a moratorium for this particular reason?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16148.366s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, while we're under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16150.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: While we're under suspension, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16152.827s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to take 15-424 and talk about community access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16171.991s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16172.992s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16175.671s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As we all know, we're getting the new Medford TV station up at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16180.694s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's going to be pretty exciting that the city is going to be moving forward finally over the next nine months or so with the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16192.588s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we could just ask the school department to get an update, not on the building, because I'll speak about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16199.172s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was section 22 a few minutes ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16201.914s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I would like to ask the school department to see where they're at as far as getting the station up and running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16207.978s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know it comes after the construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16211.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16229.799s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I certainly agree with Councilor Marks, because there's going to be people that can't go to this station because of their quarry, because it's in the school, where if it was in Medford Square or somewhere else, it might not eliminate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16239.746s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, if we could get an update from the school department on how's it going and who they plan on putting in charge of it, and just basically an update on the new station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16279.118s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16280.458s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Poulos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16284.1s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16285.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The paper that was section 22'd a little bit earlier was to get an update on the moving forward, but we can't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16292.503s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's not on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16293.283s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's incorrect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16314.926s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A developer wants to go up there, you said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16317.867s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16554.997s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16555.658s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you very much, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16557.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16558.059s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd just like to remind the viewing public that it was Councilor Penta that fought the charge to shut the access station down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16564.462s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's kind of ironic, once again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16568.918s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's many emotions he brought forward, and the record doesn't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16609.44s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, if I may just conclude, as I stated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16613.711s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The Councilor wanted to get rid of public access and now he's a proponent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16637.598s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't need personal tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16640.119s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're on your last leg here, councillor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16648.924s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's only begun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16850.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16852.82s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Before you read the records, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16855.042s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16857.003s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to wish a very, very happy 40th anniversary to our council colleagues, Adam Knight's parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16866.855s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: excuse me, Dee and Jerry Knight, 40th years of wedding bliss and marriage and two great kids, grandchildren, and I just want to wish them well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16876.799s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Happy anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=772.378s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, if we could take item 15557 offered by Councilor Caraviello under suspension. 1555.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=794.212s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Item number one, five, five, five, seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=2147.177s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso while we're under suspension, I'd like to move paper 15 four six zero off the table on the motion of a consulate Camuso to accept paper 15<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4142.693s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4146.677s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not going to speak for Councilor Caraviello, but to specifically ask one councilor to change their vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4151.981s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, I just, no one's asking me to change my vote or other people that may have voted on the other side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4158.525s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Take the vote and see where it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4159.586s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It won't fail because you're voting for it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4926.747s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a revised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4928.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, challenge the chair and take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4939.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This has happened many times in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4964.543s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4965.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4966.225s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4969.167s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we just go back to the beginning of this meeting, the paper that I took<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4975.067s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: off of the council calendar was the one from the committee and not the new paper that is on the council agenda that I'm sure later on, if this is acted upon, will be received and placed on file or withdrawn like it has in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=4990.677s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not speaking for the administration, but is that the intent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5130.931s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, I know the rules, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5131.932s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's why I was voted president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5133.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You haven't been the president since you've been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5332.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, you know, week after week, it's the same people that get up here on every single issue, and they should be able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5342.776s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the People's Forum, and they bring their... There has been not one person, other than the library group, that came up here on this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5355.2s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5356.34s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is a budget that's adding several key components that this city council's pushed for over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5362.957s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're working on a dog park right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5365.259s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're working on the substance abuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5368.823s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Coordinator is in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5370.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Code enforcement officer is in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5373.128s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The superintendent of schools is adding adjustment Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5376.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We haven't seen adjustment Councilors in how long, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=5381.477s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quite a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7540.059s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7541.88s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The dirt was addressed by the due diligence of Councilor Marks already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7580.54s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7581.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7582.601s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, I look at this a little bit differently than Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7586.362s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The need for this isn't just the business, it's the consumer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7589.543s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the consumer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7590.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you go 10, 15 feet right next to this new development, you have Dunkin' Donuts that opens at 5 a.m., and they also have the business right behind it that is cooking all night long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7600.367s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So in today's day and age, I know the council has been here for a long time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7604.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: drive-through is a fairly new thing but people actually drive right by Dunkin Donuts in other parts of the community to go to a drive-through similar to the bank I know more people that drive right by Brookline Bank down in Medford Square or in West Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7617.193s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to go to the drive-through because they have children in the back seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7620.055s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So just to be with today's day and age, I don't have any problem with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7624.939s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's good for the consumer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7627.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly, if they don't have the demand and it's not the consumers that are using it, then they're going to push the hours back, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7633.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So this is going to be consumer-driven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7635.647s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is why this is something that is a good, positive thing for economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7640.811s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is not something that was around in the 70s or in the 80s, but today in 2015,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7646.842s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is something that people look for, and this is something that I think I do support, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7653.486s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=7654.047s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8050.956s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, and you brought up a very good point regarding a lot of the other establishments that have extended hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8058.058s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would say the majority, well yes, at least two-thirds of this body, has supported extended hours and has been very economic development friendly when it comes to special permits, the majority of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8072.922s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8074.778s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't recall one coming back to us for a show cause hearing on a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8079.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The only show cause hearing I can remember in recent times was the pawn shop up on Boston Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8088.371s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, I think this is a great economic development paper and I'd like to have a roll call vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8093.476s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8151.055s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Cluso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8151.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we're all aware of very, very nice people that live in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8156.78s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We all received the calls over the last few days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8160.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And no one works harder to keep their neighborhood a great positive area to live in than the gentlemen that were just spoken about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8171.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I am fully confident that with the reviews that they'll be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8175.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if not at that time, then we'll look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8177.972s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But let's look back to when this was A&W, when it was a pretty lighted area, this particular parcel, and it was vacant for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8187.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: three, four, five years to the point where people were coming to this honorable body complaining about the weeds and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8194.872s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just, I don't take lightly their phone calls and they're advocating for their neighborhood, but this is in the best interest of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8203.819s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at some point within three or six or nine months down the road from the inception of it opening, if there's problems, we will deal with it appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8224.975s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's obviously a time lapse, too, from you meeting with them a couple months ago to them calling all the members of the council over this weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8231.54s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's a time lapse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8233.041s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And people do change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8234.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8235.022s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And get after them about the dirt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8519.516s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just to clear the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8521.052s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I stand by my comments, and I was talking about Councilor Penta's 30-plus years of service, and the drive-throughs are fairly new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8527.415s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's been around here for 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8815.932s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8818.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, Inspector Brady, very well respected in the Medford Police Department, but also throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in his rank as detective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8829.64s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He certainly made Medford proud, but he also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8833.064s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: did a lot after his retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8834.585s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He was doing private investigative work, and he was often called upon by law enforcement agencies, still, even in retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8842.972s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to send our condolences to him and his family, and his son-in-law, Chris, who worked in this building for many, many years, up until about three or four months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8854.121s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8935.207s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion to table, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=8945.091s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I got to get questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9284.429s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, as we're all gearing up for reelection, can we get this question answered as to the status of the station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9512.286s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9514.847s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The city was represented by legal counsel at the hearing, who specifically, that's his job, representing the city in a contract with cable providers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9525.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the city did have representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9528.694s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And from my understanding, there wasn't many people that participated in it, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9551.108s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's what his input was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9551.969s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The counsel is incorrect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9553.149s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He was here representing the city to get the input, to see what the people of Medford, that are cable rate payers, would like to see included in a successor agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9675.127s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, I'm going to talk facts now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9677.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The facts are the city of Medford put out a bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9679.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There was, I believe, one individual that put in a bid<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9685.157s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that currently doesn't have a corporation or a company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9690.419s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's, I'm assuming, still under review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9692.539s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The second piece of it is, we are getting a studio and it's going to be up at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9698.521s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Up at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9699.361s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9713.439s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, if I may continue talking facts, if I may continue talking facts, they did make an announcement with the director of the vocational school, Representative Donato, I believe Ann Marie Cunha was at the event, as well as Mayor McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9730.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Subsequent to that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9746.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, they are working on the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9750.648s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I actually visited the area where they're putting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9753.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And my question is, if we're going to have people go into that building, I want to make sure that they're corey cleared and taking precautions to protect our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9761.151s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And they're actually putting out they're putting out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9765.821s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They may possibly put a door leading directly into the studio so that they don't have to traverse the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9771.726s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So like I said, I just wanted to bring a couple facts to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9775.068s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's always good to ask the question, as I stated a little earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9779.251s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But also if we can get an update from Louise Miller on the one person that did put in for the bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9785.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's some entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9788.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I don't know much about the person or entity, so if we could get a report back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9792.463s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9816.967s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9819.048s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may, are you the person that put in the bid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9821.468s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nGjpg5WePi4&t=9823.449s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is news to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=47.499s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to move suspension of the rules to take paper number 15-541.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1649.855s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know why we're making this so hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1652.897s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Why don't we approve it as it is, and just ask the mayor to appropriate $75,000 from the free cash that we have right now, and it will be over with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1663.425s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is very basic stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1665.066s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1668.422s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it accomplishes the same exact goal legally because the way it was presented, you can't do it because it's not going to be certified till the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1679.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And furthermore, that's when you can do it as of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1683.572s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: By the time the division of local services get back to us, it may not be certified as certified free cash until October or November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1690.568s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1691.228s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1692.149s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is basic stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1693.29s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, I would like to make a recommendation that, uh, any requests for funding to the streets and sidewalks, which are in desperate need of repair, uh, is made, uh, to the mayor, um, to come back to this council for approval of taking out of certified free cash that we currently have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1709.199s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Therefore, we don't have to wait, uh, until this is, this is very simple, a mass municipal finance law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=1714.602s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2094.593s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's totally incorrect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2096.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It will not go to free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2098.476s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It will become free cash if we get to the end of this budget year and there is a positive balance in that account, and then it is certified by the Department of Revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2108.144s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2109.065s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2109.865s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's no other way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2111.547s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's no other way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2112.908s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is very basic mass municipal finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2117.432s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You can finish, but tell the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2186.336s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that was Councilor Camuso's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2188.037s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's what I asked to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2189.818s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we needed additional money to pull it out of certified free cash, what the council is asking to do cannot be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2196.881s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It cannot be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2198.622s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the louder we get isn't going to make it to be able to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2202.064s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2203.085s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It can't be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2204.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The budget director right here, that's an attorney, just explained to us that it can't be done the way he's presenting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2209.433s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm not here to be confrontational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2211.595s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just, I want to do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2225.023s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2227.405s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Come on, come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2230.241s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2276.001s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You didn't say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2278.541s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2279.201s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You didn't, Robert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2279.961s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Watch the tape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2470.722s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2471.063s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2472.023s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2473.044s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I have to agree with my colleague, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2477.298s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If this was being transferred for maybe other DPW accounts, it would make it a little bit more palatable, but given the condition of the roadways and everything else, now I obviously realize that this $75,000 and the other $80,000 that is in the account is going to be used to pay for police overtime and other services that were actually already given and rendered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2499.851s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, I mean, I understand that, but just like Councilor Marksley said, given the state of the repairs in the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2505.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would have liked to have seen the DPW have made it a priority to spend this money, even if it gave relief to just a couple areas of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2516.244s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, move approval, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2519.927s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2586.768s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I could, the amendment that was presented to write a check for the $75,000 was just answered by the budget director that it cannot be done the way it's presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2598.693s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if the gentleman's willing to remove that, otherwise I'm going to request a roll call vote because the question was asked and we did receive an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2609.918s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To transfer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2610.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a motion for approval on the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2616.036s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, my motion was to ask the mayor to come back with another paper requesting money out of certified free cash that was certified 2014 last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2625.465s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, I'd be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2630.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, if you leave it under the account, it's not going to be certified until October and November of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2693.002s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2695.203s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm still asking for the severance due to the fact that $75,000 is going to pay for some of the other items on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2704.904s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Police salaries, which is currently in the arrears for $270,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2708.965s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2710.786s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's why I think the cleaner way to do it would be requesting the mayor to certify free cash to do the potholes, which he could do like this if he wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2856.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, I know that sounds good, but according to mass procurement law,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2865.342s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penta wants to spend the money in July and August, and we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2869.463s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Services have to be rendered by June 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2871.603s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's state procurement law, correct, Louise?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2875.124s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2876.284s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So July and August is not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2878.445s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: June 30th, the services need to be rendered by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2885.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=2887.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3230.31s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Roll call vote on the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3611.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3613.999s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3614.579s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we have to move forward on the common victuals this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3617.5s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I'm extrapolating a lot of data right now from the city council for the last 12 years of this Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3622.995s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going through every single permit that was brought before this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3626.776s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as far as being business friendly, I'm surprised at a lot of the votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3630.657s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that the prudent thing to do this evening is to put forward the convictionless license, which anyone is entitled to if they're working within the confinement of 7am to 11pm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3645.263s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if he wants extended hours or anything, then it's an issue for another day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3766.871s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3767.092s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3768.232s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And whether it's the city clerk's office or the building department, I really don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3773.134s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The gentleman has on his application 6 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3775.774s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to 2 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3778.788s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This should have been amended before it even got to this honourable body, as Councilor Mack stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3784.116s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Wherever the ball got dropped, obviously the first place that this particular document got dropped off was our city clerk's office, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3790.907s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it shouldn't have went any further out of there with hours that were not conforming, or the hours should have been highlighted, so the building department could have picked it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3799.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I certainly agree with Councilor Marks, and this is a problem that I'm seeing all too often as I look through previous records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3809.856s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=3810.016s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The votes are staggering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4424.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4425.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4426.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4427.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I agree with the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4429.673s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we should have a breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4431.254s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Councilor Penta misspoke on one piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4433.735s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that is that it's not a firefighter that they're taking off an apparatus or anything in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4438.928s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: it is actually overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4440.909s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So we definitely want the answers of why it's going on in the breakdown, but to say that it's coming from the fire suppression team, basically pulled out of his regular job, it's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4452.175s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just wanted to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4479.609s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4480.69s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may go back, and I've been watching the tapes the last few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4485.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm keeping the tapes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4486.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And interesting enough, tomorrow I'll report back to the council next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4490.015s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you said that you're taking them away from his firefighter duties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4494.177s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when I look at that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4496.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I say that that's taking it away from peace throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4499.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I agree with the councillor, but I don't want people to think we're taking someone off of a fire apparatus for this particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4508.162s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was what was said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4509.102s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just want to clear the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4513.524s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4579.368s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to, if the councilor doesn't mind amending it, to get an update from the school department on when they think the master box will be connected back to the fire alarm system, because that's actually what's going on up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4592.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's an old system trying to tie in with a new system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4594.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could get an update on when they think it will be complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4623.324s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I actually misspoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4624.384s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4625.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's actually a paid detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4626.525s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I was referring to my notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4627.685s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a paid detail, an additional body that's not on the fire floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=4632.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5593.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Caruso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5595.046s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5596.147s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I agree with the philosophy, but limiting it to any number, I think, is disadvantageous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5605.109s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quite honestly, I don't know how the gentleman arbitrarily come up with that number, but I think this should be off of the same list as maybe reduced lunch in the public schools, for instance, because that 301 family that may want to go to Wright's Pond, and we're going to say, no, we're sorry, we can't allow you to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5622.801s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think they should look for a better way, if there already isn't a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5627.342s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not really sure, to be honest with you, if there isn't a way to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5632.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If they're already doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5639.585s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5806.74s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And also, I'm not quite honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5808.901s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not sure who is the authority of air rights over the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5813.084s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Would it be the Zoning Board of Appeals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5814.465s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Would it be the DPW?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5815.985s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can we ask this to the, and when we're talking about air rights, we're talking about the proposed walkway over Boston Avenue and down at the Tufts College Ave T-stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5827.99s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could send this to the city solicitor on who the appropriate authorities are over air rights, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5835.574s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is a unique situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5838.876s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I can't think of any other businesses that currently or private property that do this at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5944.664s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As the records of last week's meetings were sent to- For the records, just for the viewing public, City Hall will be closed tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5952.988s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So just, I think it's in honor of Bunker Hill Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=6036.37s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We voted to have that part of the budget debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2761.364s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2763.985s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2765.566s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2766.707s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just want to thank everyone in the community that's been involved over the past... This isn't just the last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2771.509s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This has been over about a month or so, that the emails, the groundswell behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2777.432s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I was ecstatic today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2780.95s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: when I spoke with the mayor and his staff around noontime, when he committed the additional funds based upon a couple of new developments that are coming online with new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2790.458s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's just a financial commitment to keep the library just not only in a better financial situation than it is today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2802.229s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But as the gentleman said a little earlier, it's going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2805.572s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I asked a similar question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2807.273s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you don't want to be in the same boat as we are now next year, when the new mayor has to look for additional funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2816.881s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so I'm glad we were able to get to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2819.323s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I really want to thank the people that were patient, because government doesn't work so quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2825.996s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We had to wait until the additional new growth not went online, but there was the actual commitment for the funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2834.142s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, week after week, it's easy for people to say, we want this, we want that, we want this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2838.085s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But ultimately, you have to pay for these city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2841.228s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this council has been committed to doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2844.41s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And like I said, this wouldn't be possible without Mayor McGlynn and his top administrative staff, because we can only approve the budget or cut the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2853.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We cannot add to the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2854.97s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just want to thank him for his commitment to the children and the residents of our community here in this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2863.333s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3771.405s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3773.027s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may, two years ago, we lost a great person, and that was Governor Cellucci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3779.011s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he was very instrumental here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3782.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He lost his battle with ALS, I'm sure most of us are aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3786.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd just like to adjourn this evening in his memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3789.018s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the one thing that I remember specifically about Governor Cellucci,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3792.987s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: was I had the distinct honor of being sworn in by him 16 years ago at the Chevalier Auditorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3800.729s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was when I first got sworn in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3802.529s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And one thing that was evident was his ability to work with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3807.291s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whether you were Mike McGlynn, the Democrat, staunch Democrat for years, or at the time, people like our senior member, staunch Republican, he worked with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3819.094s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Worked with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3820.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He was friends with Republicans, friends with Democrats, and he just was a really good guy, and he helped Medford a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3826.432s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'd just like to keep his memory alive by adjourning this evening in memory of him who passed away two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3920.333s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3921.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3921.993s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if I may, before, as Councilor Penta said, for Councilor Penta to run the campaign here as a Republican in Medford, for him to win by six votes, it's unheard of, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4710.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate the gentleman at the podium's comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4717.365s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Over the past several, three or four weeks, it's been discussed that it's gonna go, it's gotta go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4723.567s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Where are we gonna fund the $800,000 from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4726.168s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's the question, because it's gotta go is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4729.189s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this council took a vote that we'd like to see it go, but you have to pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4733.27s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a library that was looking for $250,000 this evening to just maintain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4740.977s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: status accredited and to be, not accredited, but to be part of the Minuteman Association, $800,000 of taxpayer money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4749.342s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Where are we going to take it from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4752.444s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And don't say that we'll just take them to court and get out of the contract because that's... Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4778.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name the infraction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4780.639s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name the infraction that you think a judge would say, you know what, Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4783.74s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4784.2s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Get rid of them at no charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4785.601s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name the infraction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4786.741s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You said there's seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4825.481s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the five that he just mentioned, there's not one that would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4829.044s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: put us out of the contract in a reasonable person's, um, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4834.687s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the rhetoric saying we can just get rid of it, this and that, we have to pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4837.729s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd just like to know where, because, because bring something forward, tangible, where the dollars and cents are going to come from, and then we'll look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4874.808s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So is that going to be your answer to everything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4875.928s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would mitigate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4877.728s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So your answer to everything is just going to be pay to stop this, pay to stop that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4880.609s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, I said I would mitigate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4881.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The city would be bankrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4882.289s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I said I would mitigate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4883.01s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The city would be bankrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4883.67s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not going to argue with you anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4884.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, I know, because you don't have a leg to stand on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4886.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It just doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4888.111s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilors, let's focus on the subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4891.352s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I said, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4893.045s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Back to the gentleman, I'm just sick and tired of the rhetoric saying let's get rid of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4896.433s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We need a tangible something to get rid of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4921.52s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor, you brought these minutes to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4924.742s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, I have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4927.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Don't be disingenuous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4930.391s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm glad Councilor Marks brought this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4932.133s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was him and his committee that he sat on for many years that said we need to have parking enforcement number one and parking meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4990.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso was the president at the time when I made the motion to have parking meters at the final meeting and not kiosks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4997.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if you want to just throw out stuff that's not true and inaccurate, listen, you've been doing it for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5001.842s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People are catching on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5002.582s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The numbers are going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5003.763s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But that's, but that's, we'll see if you're here November 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5007.264s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with all due respect, Mr. President, with all due respect, this council voted unanimously for this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5013.408s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a valid question to ask a colleague of mine where he's going to get the money to get out of a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5062.646s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So what difference should I make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5063.706s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Why should I think about what he said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5065.286s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I stated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5069.419s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There are valid concerns out there, but it's thrown around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5072.221s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the fourth week in a row that it's been thrown around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5074.062s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're just going to get rid of it and do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5075.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People in the community want to know where we're going to get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5077.465s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Are we going to take it from the library funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5078.866s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Are we going to take it from the school's funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5080.167s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Are we going to take it from the police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5081.447s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Where are we going to come up with the $800,000 plus to have them take a walk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5086.371s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's a legitimate question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5088.152s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if the Councilor feels uncomfortable getting a question asked, then guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5092.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know what to tell him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5093.316s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's unfortunate, but back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5095.177s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You say you wanted to get out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5111.014s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had an idea, and I didn't present it yet, but we'll see soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5114.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because with all due respect, with all due respect, with all due respect, I brought the motion forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5122.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had five members of this council support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5127.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the councilor that sits across from me wants to talk about it week after week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5130.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He hasn't made a tangible effort to bring forward a plan to get rid of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5140.187s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I said... Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5148.853s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll wrap it up, but the request that we had was for the mayor to get out of this and to come up with a plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5155.127s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penta's throwing it out without a plan, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5551.949s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: like to address a few things to the gentleman because he may walk around South Medford but as a councillor and I think most of us as councillors have heard positive feedback regarding this program from some businesses whether it's in West Medford whether it's in Medford Square where they've had their strongest March and April that they had in all time now I'm not gonna throw those businesses out there I know the mayor's done that on one occasion and I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5577.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I didn't think it was quite fair to that particular business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5580.296s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I know for a fact that the loudest member of this council to get rid of this program has been told by a business owner that it was the best march they have ever had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5592.226s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there's a business owner right here, right now, that's marched over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5595.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, Mario, as you campaign across the city, you're going to understand, there's many people in this community with different philosophies, different feelings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5602.994s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the majority of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5604.075s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, the majority of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5604.835s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Would you talk to 200?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5605.336s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The majority of them are saying that this program sucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5607.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With all due respect, with all due respect, as you're entitled to your opinion, I'm entitled to my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5614.743s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there is people in this community, business owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5618.746s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're not talking to all the business owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5621.015s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in this community, throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5622.397s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People that are on second floors, that are not on street level, that have their massage parlors throughout the squares, throughout other areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5629.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You are not getting the phone calls that this council has dealt with for the last 10 years of people parking and taking the bus all day, living in their neighborhoods like Damon Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5638.365s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: like Winthrop Street, like Boston Ave, like High Street, like Boynton Road, the gentleman nodding his head right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5643.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're not privy to those conversations, because you're not an elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5647.05s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, if you're successful in your endeavors, maybe you'll see the many different sides of every issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5653.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But to say that everyone's for it or against it, it's fiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5657.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's fiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5658.197s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's not my rhetoric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5659.437s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I can show you emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5660.438s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I can show you phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5662.739s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You walked South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5663.66s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5664.66s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know you have, because people have told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5666.241s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5668.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a portion of the community that— My rhetoric wasn't that every single person disagrees with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5911.385s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5912.145s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5913.125s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5915.066s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know for a fact that a poll was done regarding major issues in this community and parking fell well below number four, followed behind education, economic development, um, senior citizens programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5932.795s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that is factual to fall down that far on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5940.192s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: totem pole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5943.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's speaks volumes and I'm going to leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5950.494s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But so we just heard that no one's for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5954.875s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No one's for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5956.335s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But one lady that's come up here and spoke eloquently that we don't see at the council meeting every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5960.996s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this is the first time I've seen her at the council meeting and she's been here longer than all of us cause she was here for five 30 for the library meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5968.215s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is a regular, average citizen that pays an enormous tax bill on Damon Road, and she just gave her feelings on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5975.941s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for everyone to say that there's no one that's for this, this is why I caution people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5981.805s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5983.847s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6258.499s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6259.119s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd just like to add one more point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6261.7s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The city of Medford, we all do know that we get those robocalls from the Captain Clemente.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6266.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There was a robocall that went out to this entire community regarding the parking meeting that this Medford City Council was holding in room 207, right over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6274.967s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A robocall, 57,000 people, many, many homes, and the meeting fit right in that room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6291.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sure, Mr. President, that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6296.673s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not going to speak for anyone else, but I'm sure if the city administration wanted to, they could probably get the data back up that says either his phone was an answer machine or it was hung up on because they do keep records of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6308.165s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm sure for zero summit road, if they go back and look at that robocall, they'll be able to tell the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6312.951s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, um, here's one last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6318.304s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to get an update of all the revenue collected through these machines, because for every one person that it's acting up on or is having a hard time, there's another 10, 15, 20, whatever it is, used it successfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6333.393s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'd like to know how much they've taken in so far through the Park Medford application on the cellular phones that I know is becoming very popular, as well as the meters itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6360.652s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And one last point is too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6362.612s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6365.574s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Most of the majority of the people that are working there, this has been another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6370.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Misinformation, more than half of the employees there are Medford residents from this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6377.136s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, and God forbid one of them falls down and does get hurt now or something like that, throws out their back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6382.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not on the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6384.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's on the vendor, but there are Medford employees that are doing most of the jobs down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6389.902s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And other Councilors around this real can back me up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6396.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6517.92s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One piece of data that I would ask you to get maybe is the mills tax compared to last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6522.481s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there was an increase in mills tax over the winter in the city of Medford and the whole first quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6528.782s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's data that backs up your theory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6531.022s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Present our comments through the chair please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7119.206s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, the names are in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7121.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The names of current employees are in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7123.248s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They've been in our budget for years, four or five years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7128.091s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7132.694s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, no, I'm quite familiar with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7134.095s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm also quite familiar with the attempted assault on a public employee that was, that was, what's the word I'm looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7144.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That a shooting subdued after, in that the Joint Terrorism Task Force actually ended up shooting someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7151.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in Boston, in Roslindale, and then they had another situation in Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7155.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to blatantly put out this type of information, employees' addresses, and things of that nature, I don't think is prudent at this point, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7163.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We all know it's public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7165.827s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But even addresses of employees, I believe, may not be public record under the public information law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7172.193s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I can't support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7175.235s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The names are in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7176.536s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But asking for employees' addresses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7178.885s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it stinks of nothing more than just wanting to have them for your own personal database, and there's no value to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7184.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And given the situations we're dealing with currently around the greater Boston area, with some serious criminal police matters in the neighboring community of Everett and Roslindale, and possibly even within the general immediate area, I don't think I'm comfortable asking for this type of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7204.974s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Police and fire are already protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7207.074s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're not in the ward book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7208.015s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're not listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7209.114s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just don't feel comfortable doing this to any public employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7212.156s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If someone has a specific interest, they're more than welcome to come down here and get any applicable data through the Freedom of Information Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7219.119s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'm not supporting this for those reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7411.213s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7412.854s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Has there been any actual raises in the same title, or was it promotions to different positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7417.896s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because if there's a raise of $6,000 to $20,000, these are more, the people I've talked to in the school department said, most of them are putting in for different jobs, getting a promotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7428.721s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, it's called anti-spiking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7430.842s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's against the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7620.701s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7652.76s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, just a roll call vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7725.2s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the schools has traditionally put retirements in the front of the budget as well as new hires in the front of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7732.785s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And jobs that have not been filled yet show the word vacant with a salary attached to it just because it hasn't been filled yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7738.729s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But to follow up on Councilor Knight's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7741.671s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: um, statement regarding teachers and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7745.336s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The more I think of it, I'm a little less apt to, uh, to support it even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7749.642s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now in Danvers, we had a young teacher calling Ritza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7754.849s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Oh, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7756.891s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, you didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7757.572s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is, this is all departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7760.222s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: be forward to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7761.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is administrators, this is asking for secretaries and everyone else in the whole system wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7768.589s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we had a situation and we didn't, but the city of Danvers had a situation where a student was following around a teacher, uh, around her place of home and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7778.738s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we know the ultimately what happened there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7780.8s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I don't feel comfortable with this at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7782.542s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's in the budget, the same information that has always been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7785.724s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7790.058s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It says school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7809.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7810.283s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're gonna be a real- Then don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7811.264s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You don't have to make a, forget it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7812.984s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're gonna be a real good leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8495.083s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8496.344s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's about 99% of the employees get the raises, as Councilor Longo said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8500.688s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The Secretary's got a 1%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8504.451s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So everyone got a raise, basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8507.533s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We want every single job description of every single employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8510.355s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, that's the way this reads right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8533.565s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8534.326s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Where does it say lump sum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8535.326s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Am I missing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8536.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8537.327s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you paid attention, you would have heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8539.248s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The lump sum amendment was on Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8543.498s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we're going to get a blank piece of paper back, because these are fictitious, these promotions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8547.84s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, they're promotions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8548.721s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're not just raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8550.782s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, we're not here to obstruct the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8552.422s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This sounds more like a union issue at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8555.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8563.087s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8632.083s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8633.063s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8634.184s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have some people that have been waiting very patiently in the back for Councilor Penta's paper on the rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9389.816s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9390.777s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9391.817s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I certainly don't like to see any fees raised, as all of us do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9396.061s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to know, when did the park board actually increase this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9401.085s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we could get the minutes of the park board, because they're the statutory authority that actually approved this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9407.57s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Secondly, I'd like to find out when the last increase was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9411.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because I'm sure if it was done three years ago, if we could also get the minutes from the three years ago when it was increased by the park board as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9421.597s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So we can just take a look at it, also see what it's costing to run it now as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9425.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that they were looking a few years ago to possibly put one of the fountains to keep the water running like Felsmere Pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9432.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm wondering if, uh, if that's still in the plans and if this is to offset the cost of some of that, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9437.774s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could ask the park board, um, board when they did it and what the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9443.659s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9445.02s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9600.934s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9601.334s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd also like to, uh, Councilor Penta doesn't mind, um, ask for an answer to back from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9606.719s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know they were looking at, uh, a year ago when I proposed it, uh, sprinkle a park and it's that time of year again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9612.283s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the parents at the Brooks school the other day were asking, Hey, is that going to come to fruition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9615.686s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They heard about the dog park and this and that, and they're not seeing that get off the ground as quick as some people would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9621.451s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, but the sprinkle a park, I know there's a huge, huge,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9626.226s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: portion of our community that would love a sprinkler park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9628.548s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Malden just opened up another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9631.01s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They had the ribbon cutting a few days ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9634.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could get an update, because I think that that's something that will be incredible in this community, a sprinkler park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9642.478s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's something that doesn't cost a fee to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9645.44s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just the parents absolutely love them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9648.863s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People actually leave Medford to go to the DCR one over in the Belmont line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9653.206s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's how popular they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9655.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9656.037s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd hate to be behind Malden on anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10427.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can we also ask the status if there were or if they intend to have any increases at Tufts pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10440.223s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'd like to get it from the park board who raises the rates because once again, we will add that to the motion because normally they go part and parcel, the lifeguards and the, what do they call them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10450.305s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Not park rangers, attendants, bath attendants, park attendants and the park police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10455.178s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, park rangers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10456.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mike Penta just got promoted to lieutenant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10462.42s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mike Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10522.514s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10523.955s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10524.976s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may too, if we can congratulate Michael Penta, who was just promoted in our community to lieutenant of the Medford Park Ranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10535.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Michael Penta has been a very good employee for about 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11008.907s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11010.088s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm assuming at this point this has been talked about between the different agencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11014.877s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this needs to be done and something in writing has to be disseminated to the state police if they approve it, as well as the Medford police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11023.161s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My concern is if they do not open up Route 16 to the smaller trucks, you're going to have these trucks going down Summer Street to evade the congestion during the traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11035.587s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to be going up South Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11037.068s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to be going through Forest Street, Lawrence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11039.969s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to be going everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11042.743s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Street that can handle it the most is Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11045.424s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as we're all aware of, Route 16, you can't have any trucks on the DCR roadways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11050.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So during the Craddock Bridge construction, I think it just does make sense to do this to alleviate the neighborhood traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11058.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The roads are certainly bigger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11059.83s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know in the past, the concern has been some of the trees and things of that nature years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11065.052s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just think it's going to, if we don't look into this and have something in writing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11071.926s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're going to just add more confusion to the neighborhoods, and as Mr. D'Antonio said earlier about the parking, just going to keep pushing it back, pushing it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11079.688s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: George Street, then onto Boston Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11081.868s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So by this simple approach, I think we can help alleviate some of the side street traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11137.094s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Like I said, I'd rather see them go down route 16, Mr. President, than coming through Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11141.476s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We all know Councilor Marks a few years ago had a very good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11143.837s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just the trash trucks can't get through Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11146.366s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the morning, there would be a bus and a trash truck, it would be total gridlock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11150.287s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think, I understand Councilor Caraviello, he's got a very good point, but we're asking for trucks to start going down streets like where you live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11163.209s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, right now the state police are pulling over any truck that has a box on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11176.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Come 2 o'clock, you just can't get out of that parkway anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11178.654s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, no, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11179.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I think it's better off than getting them down the high street and everywhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11389.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11390.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn has a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11393.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll send this to that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11397.474s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And like I said, this actually presented itself from people on Harvard Street in South Medford that are concerned about the trucks that we gave them some alleviation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11406.361s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And now they're concerned that it's going to be back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11409.643s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when I thought about that, you start thinking about Spring Street again and Riverside Ave, where the trucks have always been a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11416.048s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to thank Councilor Alango-Kern for offering that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11419.33s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11420.891s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'll move this paper to that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11423.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11423.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So on the motion of Council, it was to table this until that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11426.736s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, not to table it on the council agenda, just forward it to that meeting, forward it to the committee of the whole, because if it's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11433.269s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a presentation on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11435.611s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11436.652s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Even better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11438.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11440.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11440.675s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12059.828s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12062.49s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The majority of the city council has been very supportive of the transgender issues here in our community, as well as just opening up in full and equal access across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12074.06s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We've made some significant strides in this community over the past few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12077.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd just like to go on record in supporting Boston Pride Week and continuing to have an all-inclusive community for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12093.99s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12096.771s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, it's Gay and Lesbian Pride Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12099.332s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Boston happens to be this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12102.734s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12103.894s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12104.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You want to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12108.563s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: have our own week, Medford Pride Week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12116.545s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think, I think Medford has done a significant job in this particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12121.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I said, the majority of the city council has supported tremendous movement forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12127.508s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The bathroom issues at the Medford public schools that were discussed here, as well as many other things over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12133.87s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So we have a proven track record as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1353.482s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the neighbours and especially Mr. Fitzpatrick for coming here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1360.447s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is going to be a major impact on our community, and this City Council, under the resolution of Councilor Marks, actually worked with our Chief of Police to put up some sort of structure on the Medford side so that it's not only somewhat aesthetically pleasing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1379.43s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but also just to cut the flow of traffic as a cut through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1382.992s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I remember for many, many years when it was the Malden hospital, it was a cut through and it'd be thousands of cars per day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1389.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Every change of shift at night, ambulances coming up there and just, it was, uh, it was chaos in the residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1396.719s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it wasn't like our hospital that is abutted by Lawrence road, governor's ave and forest street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1401.021s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was small little, uh, homes on a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1404.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: streets that's traversed by two vehicles, and you can't even fit a car parked on the side when two vehicles are going by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1410.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's a big difference when an ambulance is going through there with the lights on, not necessarily the siren, because when they get to that point, they'd always shut it off, as the neighbors know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1418.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the red lights and everything else would light the whole house up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1422.556s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I think we have to be very cognizant of the fact, Mr. President, that this is a city of Malden project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1429.381s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Malden has the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1433.805s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're all and be all as far as getting the vendor slash developer into the table and actually can arrange an agreement with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1444.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Where Medford, we're limited because the amount of housing and developing happening on the Medford side, if they do it consistent with the current zoning and they don't have to go to the board of appeals, there's really nothing Medford could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1459.684s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If it's scaled back to the point where it's going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1464.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: where it's going to fit within our zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1467.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I think we should send a resolve to the City of Malden, the Mayor Christensen, as well as to their City Council that we do want to work with them, same way Malden and Everett worked with us during station landing in Somerville, and as well as the City of Medford working with the Stoneham development up at the New England Memorial Hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1486.775s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're cognizant of the fact that some development is going to take place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1489.556s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quite honestly, I talked to several of the neighbours and they're just sick and tired of seeing the vacant building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1493.518s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They said they have rodents going in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1495.939s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's people that sneak in and try to take it over living there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1500.381s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And unfortunately, it's not conducive to a good quality of life as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1504.583s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I think we just got to send the message in a nice tone that we want to work with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1508.885s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're interested in seeing good, prudent development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1512.227s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But at the same token, we have to understand that Malden<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1515.145s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is the driving force behind this, and they're the only people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1518.086s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, Malden, we'll have to realize that the city of Medford could take them to court and tie up the job for 10 years if they wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1525.547s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But we don't want to spend our taxpayers' money if we don't have to as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1530.929s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I think we just have to send a message that we understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1534.049s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as I said, you look at some of the developments that we had in our community over the years, and the surrounding communities did not take us to court, worked with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1542.771s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But we were very amenable sitting down with them, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1545.534s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: talking about traffic flow and things that we could do as our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1550.216s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I think we have to do that with Malden and at least send the message that we're on top of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1554.798s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Our neighbors, our taxpayers are very concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1558.68s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as long as we're all on this city council, we're going to continue to monitor the situation, but most importantly, send the strong message that we want something a little bit scaled back, number one, and number two, something that's not going to affect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1573.459s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the runoff, because I've seen projects like this where people that live in an area don't have groundwater coming through their basements, and then you do a project of this magnitude, next thing you know, the next storm, they have groundwater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1584.346s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It just changes the whole flow of things, stormwater, runoff water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1589.05s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1593.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's something that we've all been following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1597.543s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think we have to be very cognizant of the fact that it is Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1601.746s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I mean, there is small groups in Malden that are saying they don't want a project at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1606.149s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly, I think that's unrealistic, because you're better off having to say something that you get there than someone coming in and saying, hey, we're going to make this whatever, something that conforms to zoning, but not something you want in your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1622.3s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Certain types of medical facilities and things like that that people would prefer not in the heart of their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1627.752s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And right now, and here's the other thing, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1631.073s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You want to have the developer at least come back with a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1634.353s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If he's not interested in doing it any way except the way he's doing it, then he should tell them all that, hey, I'm not interested and move on and let the Hallmark Health go out and look at the whole situation again and see if they're interested in other opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1647.996s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so that's about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1649.896s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just want to thank everyone for coming down tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1652.577s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1653.837s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1974.255s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1975.275s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1975.755s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Kelty, why are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1978.702s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I see that you cut back significantly, and it's a nice plan you brought forward, but do you have any developers in mind that if it's not necessarily this developer who would actually come forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1988.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That would have to be found, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1990.508s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, we haven't shopped that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1992.429s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay, because I mean, to arbitrarily, and I'm just playing devil's advocate here, because you want this to work for our neighborhood and your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=1999.013s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm concerned about the Medford side, to be quite frank with you, but from a standpoint of getting a developer in there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2007.779s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm just being realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2009.862s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Developers, you're going to see little interest, probably, with the scope of the work cut back by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2050.265s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And like I said, it sounds great in theory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2053.167s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's certainly better for the neighborhood, but I think at the same time we just have to be realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2059.332s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have to sharpen our pencils and see where the money is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2061.233s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because if we're not realistic, it's a waste of everyone's time to sit at the BB school or any school for that matter and come up with a great plan that sounds good, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2069.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you don't make it to the point where the developers want to come in, then you're going to be sitting looking at a vacant building with the temporary still fence around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2078.982s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's ultimately not the goal, I don't think, for Malden or Medford, because quite honestly, many neighbors up in that area are sick and tired of the transient people trying to break in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2088.892s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The police are there all the time breaking in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2090.673s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's rodent problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2092.965s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's coming to the point where it's bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2122.724s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, I'm sorry So the if Hallmark takes it down then we're dealing with a different situation because but now you've got a different animal We will be getting calls if that's a vacant lot now, and I'm just based upon my experience here You'll be getting calls from the neighbors in Medford and Malton if it's a vacant lot<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2137.621s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That there's kids drinking there every weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2140.223s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's, as I stated earlier, the best thing for both communities is to probably come up with a realistic plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2146.808s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because I know there are people in Malden that are dead against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2172.651s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the Medford side, we will, Medford working with the developer, I think significantly the project was already cut back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2179.919s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: From the original one, as far as the housing and those things going on in the Medford side, it's been scaled back, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2185.026s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know why it's not happening in Malden, but... For this one or other projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2189.372s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For this particular one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2190.273s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this one because they don't want to fight two battles, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2192.416s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, yeah, and they know the Zoning Board of Appeals probably wouldn't go along with it, but there's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2218.762s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm just very cognizant of the fact, we've dealt with schools in Medford, believe me, that sat for 30 years, vacant buildings right in the heart of our neighborhoods here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2226.783s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's people in the audience that know the buildings I'm talking about, and it just, it's not a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2231.284s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: How long has Malden been closed now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2232.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Probably since 1999, 2000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2233.504s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 99, so it's been 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2236.865s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, so it's quite a long time, but all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2240.806s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know that just to knock that down and get rid of it and get rid of the material and stuff is about three or $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2248.932s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: just to knock it down, just to get the trucks in here and abate it properly, and you're dealing with asbestos and everything else with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2316.866s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We've seen it many times in this community We're gonna raise a ton of dole for this project that project that guess what at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2321.708s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2322.648s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's back before the city council from the mayor looking for a bond because it sounded good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2327.35s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They were going to raise half a million dollars on their own to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2330.251s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And eventually it just didn't take off the way it was going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2334.132s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's why we're not relying on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2336.153s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2336.894s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So yeah, we have, we have all the options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2340.415s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2341.615s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And um, I just like to make one motion and that is to go back to council of Marx's motion, um, of several months ago, which I think is the biggest piece of this puzzle for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2351.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and that is we do not want the opening at the end of the road leading into the Malden development to create the chaos and the havoc that was here post-1999.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2361.652s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could just send that resolution again, if Councilor Mark sees fit, where he was the original author, would you be okay with that, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2369.235s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Send that right to Malden and say that that's something that we need in order to be working with the people on this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2702.21s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm very sorry to speak again on this issue, but these plans were put forward by you, Mr. Kelty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2707.974s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Did you draw these ones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2726.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The new cut-through that's proposed on, the new proposal is diverting the traffic from Lund Road, now to Murray Hill Road, and then to Falz Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2736.931s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think, uh, I know he, I know they talked, this says new cut-through, that's why I'm a little, I think that was just conceptual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2758.637s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2760.197s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just where you were showing us these boards, and I thought that this was the title.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2769.519s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Which, that's where the traffic commission comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2772.219s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just thought it was part and parcel of all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2775.28s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2832.669s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you Mr. President and I want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Penta for for joining in and having this resolution for a wonderful person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2842.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're all friendly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2844.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: here with the Brennan family in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2847.196s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the distinct pleasure of chatting every Tuesday night with young Timothy after our council meetings and he'd be giving me the critique in it on how we all did it on the evening and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2861.706s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The, um, Timmy, I remember way, way back when, when I was a little kid, Timmy was a little older working with Marilyn Perica's campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2869.03s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We were just little kids walking the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2870.752s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's when, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2872.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penta was a councilor back in 87, 88.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2878.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I remember seeing all the councilors, and it was a great race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2882.294s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just remember Timmy walking the streets, and we were just young kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2886.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Then fast forward to 1997, I was lucky enough to have worked with Timmy in his work to get on the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2896.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Ultimately, Timmy landed his dream job, and that was with his dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2902.174s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: uh, was Bob as well as his three brothers, Tom, Eddie, and Jimmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2906.717s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that was a firefighter in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2909.399s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, many people didn't realize that, uh, Timmy has been sick for a little, little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2916.143s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um, ultimately the, um, he, uh, gave a valiant fight and unfortunately, uh, last Tuesday evening when we were wrapping up our city council meeting here, uh, Timmy passed away at the mass general hospital with his family by his side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2931.402s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So just if we could send our condolences to Helen and the three boys, and if we could dedicate tonight's meeting in honor of Timothy Brennan, Medford firefighter from Engine 4, that we're going to sorely miss at the young age of 46.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2945.665s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=2947.565s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4834.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4835.824s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this has been presented to us over the many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4841.887s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And my stance has always been and still shall be that this was citizen driven, as Jean Martin said, in 1986 and 87, a very active group of community members went out and they got the signatures and they put it on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4859.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if people are committed to changing the charter in this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4862.565s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: then that is the process that I feel is the way it should be done, same way that it has been done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4870.37s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for that reason, I do not support this, but I certainly think that the charter review is a good thing, but I just don't like the mechanism of doing it opposite the way that it was done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4883.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's something that has such a great drive in this community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4892.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to move the city forward, that I just think it should be citizen-driven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4897.976s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Quite honestly, if we were to just do it with a flick of a pen on a Tuesday evening, it's an insult to everyone that worked so hard, including Councilor Penta and Mary-Anne Frazzoli and many, many other people back in 1986.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4912.403s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, that's my reasons and that's about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4915.245s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7274.848s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7275.488s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7277.182s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on this evening for the two of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7283.464s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Kenny Nesta was a great guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7285.245s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Many people would not only know him from the baseball field, but as a retired post mailman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7291.027s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Did the West Medford route for, I'd say, 20 plus years or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7295.548s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then in his golden years of retirement, he was a custodian for the Malden Catholic Lancers over at MC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7302.75s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So just a great, fantastic guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7305.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: has wonderful kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7306.908s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One of them is our PAC superintendent, Mike Nesta, another great kid and loving grandchildren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7312.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just, he's gotta be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7313.352s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just an all around good guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=7315.753s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=52.701s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=53.561s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to take paper<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=60.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 15-460 off the table and refer it to Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1101.409s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1101.89s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um, I can certainly understand the frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1104.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My home is right, uh, right underneath one of the paths and it seems like every weekend it's, uh, it's, it's coming from like the Winchester line right over, uh, the large Memorial hospital and, uh, into Logan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1115.813s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, it is, it is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1119.245s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's louder some days than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1120.587s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When the bigger planes, the 747s, are either taking off or landing, it's a lot louder than some of the smaller A320s and some of them double-engine planes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1131.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I certainly agree with the resolve in looking in to see if there's some mitigation money out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1135.459s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I also am very cognizant of the fact that Massport's first and most top priority is for the safety of the flights in and out of Logan Airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1144.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm sure they'll work with us any way they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1147.112s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is a catch-22, this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1150.214s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For the same reason people are paying a large amount of money for their homes here in our community, it's because of its proximity to Boston, to the airport, to the financial district, and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1162.72s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's sort of a catch-22, shall we say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1165.122s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Councilor Marks championed this issue many years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1168.303s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He was on the front page of the Boston Herald.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1170.325s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it was the Herald, was it, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1173.286s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With this very particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1175.165s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as I said in my conversations with Massport officials at the time, and that was about three or four years ago, I believe, more than that, as Councilor Mark says, they understand the frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1187.03s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we do meet a threshold in certain areas of the community, then there is sometimes funding out there to do mitigation within the homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1197.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Winthrop receives a lot of money for the homes right in Winthrop, East Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1204.369s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, unfortunately, this is, and I don't want to underestimate the severity of the noise, believe me, because I understand it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1217.437s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I have a five-year-old, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that it is seven miles from Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1227.883s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is one thing that we have to expect, maybe not with the volume,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1231.892s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Boston, it's an international airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1235.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not like Lawrence or Hyannis Airport, where you get flights every so often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1240.095s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're an international airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1241.515s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You look at these planes, and they are low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1243.256s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You can read them, Lufthansa, Alitalia, and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1247.997s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm more concerned about the safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1251.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Like I said, quite frankly, right after September 11th in the year 2001, there was an airline accident that happened right in New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1261.146s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and it wasn't terrorist, it was mechanical failure or something of that nature, but it was, it landed under mechanical distress or whatever it was in a very populated area that was homes and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1277.256s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as I understand it, and the other thing is too, as the gentleman that comes up here weekly with his little tablet looking up webpages said so eloquently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1288.598s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He alluded to the fact of the winds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1292.041s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The planes have to take off into the wind in order to get off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1297.064s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So with that being said, a lot of the takeoffs are predicated upon the wind and the weather and all that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1305.971s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I certainly do agree with the studies that Councilor Marks brought up years ago and Councilor Lungo-Koehn again this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1312.456s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I do support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1314.297s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just, as I stated, I'm not going to repeat the will,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1319.387s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I've heard that many people in the community this weekend at the coffee shop stated, because they read the council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1324.83s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And they were a little bit like, hey, when I moved to Medford from Salem, Mass., I knew I was paying $575,000 for my home to get closer to Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1335.374s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this was one of the setbacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1338.576s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I certainly understand all the frustrations out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2920.14s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The library has a parking lot directly adjacent to the building, and I drive through that street quite frequently, and it butts it directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2929.767s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's always available spots in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2932.408s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4074.47s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On my first point is you had Eversource here as a result of Councilor Marks bringing the issue forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4083.753s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I applaud you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4086.835s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And my second point of information is we did have representatives from the bridge here about a year ago, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4094.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Twice in six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4096.778s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4097.418s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at that point they stated that there won't be any mitigation to businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4104.728s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: even though this council did ask for it, they clearly stated that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4108.449s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, I don't want businesses to think otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4227.882s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was the Department of Transportation representatives that were here meeting with this city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4233.783s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Clearly stated that the state does not pay mitigation on projects, but what they do do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4240.88s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is pay for any damages to any public or private entities that are damaged as a result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4248.125s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's a big difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4249.406s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mitigation and physical damage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4269.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can throw out the red herring, say an MWRA or any other agency he wants to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4274.399s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They are not a state agency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4277.08s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The MWRA is a separate and distinct authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4280.402s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's an authority like Massport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4281.803s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's an authority like the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4283.844s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Their rules, their laws are different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4286.838s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The Department of Transportation clearly stated this to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4290.0s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They said it right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4290.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we have to go back, rewind the tape, maybe the council forgot what they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4294.542s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not responsible for what he remembers, but I'm responsible for what happened here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4298.284s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that is clearly what was said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4299.884s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The state does not pay mitigation on public projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4380.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4382.332s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4383.822s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to say that there was no public meetings, it's fiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4386.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's fiction, once again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4388.246s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We had a meeting here with the representatives from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4394.691s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One of them's name was Donald Daly, and I don't remember the other gentleman's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4400.036s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4400.596s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul King.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4401.297s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul King.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4402.197s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They were here at a 7 PM meeting of the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4405.56s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4406.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4407.162s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4407.742s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to sit here and say that there hasn't been public<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4470.674s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4472.055s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The bus routes are going to go, the main bus route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4476.177s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if the councillor took the time to reach out to the correct officials as I did,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4480.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but the bus route is going to be moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4499.122s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I stated, if the councillor doesn't want to go over and above, as I have over my 16 years of public service, reaching out to the particular people that can make, rather than yelling and screaming in hot air, can actually make the bus stop moved, they are moving it across the river over near the bridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4516.685s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And hopefully it will be a permanent home even after the construction project with a nice greenery and maybe a bus shelter that Councilor Marks brought up before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4525.266s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I am doing some talks with the appropriate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4529.114s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4530.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Number two, I'm going to revert to a conversation I had with the councillor just a week ago, who was adamant about a former member of this council not bringing up the beer and wine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4547.725s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a pattern of your fictitious mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4554.971s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's nothing to do with the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4560.076s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I started to say, Mr. President, earlier in his dissertation this evening, he said there was no public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4565.923s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In fact, there were two public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4568.406s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the public meetings were in 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4569.987s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4572.47s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and we had one here at the Medford City Council, not in 2013, I will get you the exact date, but it was right here, the gentlemen were here, it was the first meeting, the first item agenda, I believe, and it was a very, very good meeting, and they emphatically stated, I mean, if you wanna make up the rules as you go along, like you've done a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4593.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I said, Mr. President, if he wants to let people believe there's mitigation available and set people up for failure, that's his responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4625.737s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There was one today that he didn't go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4629.379s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, I mean...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4671.984s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So Mr. President, if I just can finish council, and I'll wrap it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4675.765s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just, um, in council Lungo-Koehn is a hundred percent correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4679.706s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There can be lawsuits and there probably will be lawsuits, but the fact of the matter is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on this particular matter is the department of transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4687.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: does not pay mitigation for two businesses as a result of public works projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4695.472s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If that was the case when they did the central artery and took down all the green space in there and did the Rose Kennedy Garden, the disruption, Mr. President, the disruption is lousy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4708.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I understand that completely, completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4732.645s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Mr. President, precisely, it was a public works mitigation that went to the city of Boston, not to the businesses that were directly affected in that area, like Faneuil Hall Marketplace and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4747.461s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, businesses property get taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4750.667s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, the city, I'm sorry, the state, they said that at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4756.488s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This isn't fiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4757.548s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is factual, what the state said to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4760.569s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now if the law changes, I hope it changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4763.209s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I hope it changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4764.309s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, I think our biggest thing right now is doing everything in our power to help the businesses, as I've been doing with other members of this council, talking to the MBTA about moving a bus stop that is gonna be detrimental to the passengers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4778.972s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in the current state of placement of it, as well as for the businesses that are already going to be dealing with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4786.215s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So let's work on the stuff that we do have some input and control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4790.637s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The DOT is overseeing this project, the Department of Transportation, and City Clerk Finn, at what point have they notified you about the public hearings coming up regarding posting it on the board and everything, or not yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4807.775s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can you turn him on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4820.421s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because this Saturday, too, the bid went out for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4824.803s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The bid went out this Saturday, two days ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4835.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the DOT does notify?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4837.792s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: city though where it is in the city correct normally okay so so like I said it just public meetings are meetings to get the information public hearings are more legality it's a legality in certain instances you need a public hearing correct me if I'm wrong clerk Finn is that correct public hearing is a legality if it calls for you if it calls for you but they're not gonna have public hearings unless it calls for it correct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4864.03s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, there's a difference between public hearing and public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4865.992s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4867.453s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And given the public hearings that may be called for this might be because of the river underneath it and the river being affected by it and that environmental public hearing, things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4881.086s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Conservation things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4882.127s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But typically there's not public hearings for doing a bridge over within a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4887.472s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There doesn't need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4888.837s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: because it doesn't need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4889.838s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4890.178s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just, I think that's important to, um, cause Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought up a very valid point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4895.381s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, uh, if there is going to be public hearings, number one, they will hold them at an open, open place where people can participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4903.926s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It will be duly advertised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4905.688s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, and it also will be on the bulletin boards here at city hall, but unless it calls for it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4910.42s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: unless it calls for it for a specific legality, and that's because maybe they're building so close to the water and this and that, but they just don't have public hearings, as you said, Mr. Clerk, for the sake of just having public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4925.686s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a legal authority behind a public hearing and not so much a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5369.499s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5370.279s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5372.18s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5373.561s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5374.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the city administration up to this point, this has been front and center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5379.458s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This afternoon, I believe 1 or 1.30, there was a meeting with all the department heads, the Department of Transportation, the Chamber of Commerce, and so everyone was at the table, and maybe they're working out specifics right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5394.07s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and then they'll be bringing it forward at another level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5397.832s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, at another meeting, I do not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5400.533s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there is ongoing dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5403.114s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as Councilor Knight said, there may be something we can do internally, whether it's a tax break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5408.756s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But most of that's not going to help the businesses either, because it's the building owners, the owners of the building, and then it's businesses that are paying rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5415.459s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there's stuff that we might be able to do, I'm thinking, outside the box in our community, like Councilor Knight said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5420.925s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just, when the word mitigation came up, I heard loud and clear what they said that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5426.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just don't want to mislead businesses in the community that may think they're going to get a big check from the Department of Transportation as a result of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5435.491s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just think, I think we have to be fair to them and not give them false hopes that they're going to get a golden bar at the end of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5445.336s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When the state clearly said when they were here, they're not in the business of paying mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5448.955s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But they will be willing to work with the city on maybe smaller projects in the immediate area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5455.378s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If they're parking on a park to park their trucks during the thing, they'll do the park over maybe, or something like that, similar to the other projects that have taken place here within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5466.543s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I look forward to the future dialogue on this particular matter, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=46.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=47.111s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to take paper<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=53.508s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 15-460 off the table and refer it to Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1095.949s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, and I can certainly understand the frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1099.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My home is right underneath one of the paths, and it seems like every weekend it's coming from the Winchester line right over the large Memorial Hospital into Logan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1110.38s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it is...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1113.795s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's louder some days than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1115.156s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When the bigger planes, the 747s, are either taking off or landing, it's a lot louder than some of the smaller A320s and some of them double-engine planes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1125.963s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I certainly agree with the resolve in looking in to see if there's some mitigation money out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1130.025s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I also am very cognizant of the fact that Massport's first and most top priority is for the safety of the flights in and out of Logan Airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1139.111s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm sure they'll work with us any way they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1141.675s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is a catch-22, this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1144.796s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For the same reason people are paying a large amount of money for their homes here in our community, it's because of its proximity to Boston, to the airport, to the financial district, and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1156.521s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's sort of a catch-22, shall we say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1159.703s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Councilor Marks championed this issue many years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1162.904s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He was on the front page of the Boston Herald.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1164.925s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it was the Herald, was it, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1167.886s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With this very particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1169.782s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as I said in my conversations with Massport officials at the time, and that was about three or four years ago, I believe, more than that, as Councilor Mark says, they understand the frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1181.647s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we do meet a threshold in certain areas of the community, then there is sometimes funding out there to do mitigation within the homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1192.212s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Winthrop receives a lot of money for the homes right in Winthrop, East Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1199.003s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, unfortunately, I don't want to underestimate the severity of the noise, believe me, because I understand it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1212.067s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I have a five-year-old, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1220.052s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It is seven miles from Boston, and this is one thing that we have to expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1225.055s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe not with the volume, but Boston, it's an international airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1230.177s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not like Lawrence or Hyannis Airport where you get flights every so often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1234.76s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're an international airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1236.18s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You look at these planes, and they are low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1237.941s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You can read them, Lufthansa, Alitalia, and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1242.684s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm more concerned about the safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1245.767s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Like I said, quite frankly, right after September 11th in the year 2001, there was an airline accident that happened right in New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1255.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it wasn't terrorist, it was mechanical failure or something of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1260.172s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But it was, it landed under mechanical distress or whatever it was, in a very populated area that was homes and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1271.957s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as I understand it, and the other thing is too,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1275.088s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As the gentleman that comes up here weekly with his little tablet looking up web pages said so eloquently, he alluded to the fact of the winds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1286.752s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The planes have to take off into the wind in order to get off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1291.794s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So with that being said, a lot of the takeoffs are predicated upon the wind and the weather and all that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1300.697s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I certainly do agree with the studies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1303.56s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that Council Marks brought up years ago, and Council Lungo-Koehn again this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1307.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I do support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1309.024s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just, as I stated, I'm not going to repeat the wheel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1314.128s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I've heard that many people in the community this weekend at the coffee shop stated, because they read the council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1319.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And they were a little bit like, hey, when I moved to Medford from Salem Mass, I knew I was paying $575,000 for my home to get closer to Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1330.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this was one of the setbacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=1333.342s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I certainly understand all the frustrations out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2916.419s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The library has a parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2919.331s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: directly adjacent to the building, and I drive through that street quite frequently, and it butts it directly, there's always available spots in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2928.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=2930.516s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4071.839s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On my first point is you had Eversource here as a result of Councilor Marks bringing the issue forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4081.146s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I applaud you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4083.007s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And my second point of information is we did have representatives from the bridge here about a year ago, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4091.674s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Twice in six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4094.196s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4094.837s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at that point they stated that there won't be any mitigation to businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4102.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: even though this council did ask for it, they clearly stated that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4105.847s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I don't want businesses to think otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4221.79s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4225.412s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was the Department of Transportation representatives that were here meeting with this city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4231.317s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Clearly stated that the state does not pay mitigation on projects, but what they do do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4238.419s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is pay for any damages to any public or private entities that are damaged as a result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4245.664s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's a big difference, mitigation and physical damage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4266.949s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can throw out the red herring, say an MWRA or any other agency he wants to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4271.952s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They are not a state agency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4274.654s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The MWRA is a separate and distinct authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4277.975s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's an authority like Massport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4279.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's an authority like the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4281.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Their rules, their laws are different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4284.428s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The Department of Transportation clearly stated this to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4287.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They said it right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4288.451s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we have to go back, rewind the tape, maybe the council forgot what they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4292.134s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not responsible for what he remembers, but I'm responsible for what happened here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4295.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that is clearly what was said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4297.479s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The state does not pay mitigation on public projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4378.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4380.004s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4381.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to say that there was no public meetings, it's fiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4384.515s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's fiction, once again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4385.915s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We had a meeting here with the representatives from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4392.358s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One of them's name was Donald Daly, and I don't remember the other gentleman's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4397.701s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4398.281s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul King.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4398.982s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul King.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4399.882s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They were here at a 7 PM meeting of the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4403.944s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4404.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4405.425s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to sit here and say that there hasn't been public<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4468.429s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4469.79s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The bus routes are going to go, the main bus route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4473.931s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if the councillor took the time to reach out to the correct officials as I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4478.426s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but the bus route is going to be moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4496.699s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, as I stated, if the Councilor doesn't want to go over and above, as I have over my 16 years of public service,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4503.402s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: reaching out to the particular people that can make, rather than yelling and screaming in hot air, can actually make the bus stop moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4510.404s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They are moving it across the river over near the bridge and hopefully it will be a permanent home even after the construction project with a nice greenery and maybe a bus shelter that Councilor Marks brought up before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4523.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I am doing some talks with the appropriate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4526.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4527.839s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Number two, I'm going to revert to a conversation I had with the councillor just a week ago, who was adamant about a former member of this council not bringing up the beer and wine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4545.563s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a pattern of your fictitious mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4557.907s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I started to say, Mr. President, earlier in his dissertation this evening, he said there was no public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4563.768s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In fact, there were two public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4565.549s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This, I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4566.869s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the public meetings were in 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4567.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4570.31s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and we had one here at the Medford City Council, not in 2013, I will get you the exact date, but it was right here, the gentlemen were here, it was the first meeting, the first item agenda, I believe, and it was a very, very good meeting, and they emphatically stated, I mean, if you wanna make up the rules as you go along, like you've done a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4591.5s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I said, Mr. President, if he wants to let people believe there's mitigation available and set people up for failure, that's his responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4623.637s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There was one today that he didn't go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4669.935s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So Mr. President, if I just can finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4671.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso has the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4672.977s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'll wrap it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4674.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Councilor Lungo-Koehn is 100% correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4677.68s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There can be lawsuits, and there probably will be lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4680.423s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the fact of the matter is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on this particular matter is the Department of Transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4685.445s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: does not pay mitigation for two businesses as a result of public works projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4693.451s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If that was the case when they did the central artery and took down all the green space in there and did the Rose Kennedy Garden, the disruption, Mr. President, the disruption is lousy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4706.601s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I understand that completely, completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4730.658s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Mr. President, precisely, it was a public works mitigation that went to the city of Boston, not to the businesses that were directly affected in that area, like Faneuil Hall Marketplace and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4745.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, businesses property get taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4748.693s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, the city, I'm sorry, the state, they said that at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4754.515s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This isn't fiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4755.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is factual, what the state said to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4758.597s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now if the law changes, I hope it changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4761.258s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I hope it changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4762.358s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, I think our biggest thing right now is doing everything in our power to help the businesses, as I've been doing with other members of this council, talking to the MBTA about moving a bus stop that is gonna be detrimental to the passengers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4777.013s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in the current state of placement of it, as well as for the businesses that are already going to be dealing with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4784.277s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So let's work on the stuff that we do have some input and control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4788.699s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The DOT is overseeing this project, the Department of Transportation, and City Clerk Finn, at what point have they notified you about the public hearings coming up regarding posting it on the board and everything, or not yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4805.852s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can you turn him on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4818.517s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because this Saturday, too, the bid went out for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4822.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The bid went out this Saturday, two days ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4833.363s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the DOT does notify?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4835.765s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the city though, where it is in the city, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4838.066s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Normally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4839.547s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4840.208s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, um, so like I said, it just, uh, public meetings are meetings to get the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4845.651s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Public hearings are more legality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4848.293s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a legality in certain instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4850.434s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You need a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4851.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4852.195s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Clerk Finn, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4853.776s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Public hearing is a legality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4856.238s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If it, if it calls for you, if it calls for it, but they're not going to have public hearings unless it calls for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4861.581s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4862.157s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, there's a difference between public hearing and public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4864.138s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4865.579s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And given the public hearings that may be, may be called for this might be because of the, um, the river underneath it and the river being affected by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4875.624s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's a environmental public hearing, things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4879.226s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Conservation things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4880.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But typically there's not public hearings for doing a bridge over within a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4885.669s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If it doesn't need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4886.98s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: because it doesn't need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4888.1s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4888.34s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just, I think that's important to, um, cause council Lungo-Koehn brought up a very valid point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4893.542s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, uh, if there is going to be public hearings, number one, they will hold them at an open, open place where people can participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4902.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It will be duly advertised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4903.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, and it also will be on the bulletin boards here at city hall, but unless it calls for it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4908.597s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: unless it calls for it for a specific legality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4911.838s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's because maybe they're building so close to the water and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4916.199s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But they just don't have public hearings, as you said, Mr. Clerk, for the sake of just having public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=4923.862s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a legal authority behind a public hearing and not so much a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5372.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5372.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the city administration, up to this point, this has been front and center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5378.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This afternoon, I believe, 101.30, there was a meeting with all the department heads, the Department of Transportation, the Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5385.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so everyone was at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5388.206s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And maybe they're working out specifics right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5392.707s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then they'll be bringing it forward at another level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5396.488s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, at another meeting, I do not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5399.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there is ongoing dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5401.754s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as Councilor Knight said, there may be something we can do internally, whether it's a tax break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5407.597s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But most of that's not going to help the businesses either, because it's the building owners, the owners of the building, and then it's businesses that are paying rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5414.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there's stuff that we might be able to do, I'm thinking outside the box, in our community, like Councilor Knight said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5419.602s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just, when the word mitigation came up, I heard loud and clear what they said that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5425.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just don't want to mislead businesses in the community that may think they're going to get a big check from the Department of Transportation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5431.959s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: as a result of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5434.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just think, I think we have to be fair to them and not give them false hopes that they're going to get a golden bar at the end of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5444.003s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When the state clearly said when they were here, they're not in the business of paying mitigation, but they will be willing to work with the city on maybe smaller projects in the immediate area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5454.086s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If they're parking on a park to park their trucks during the thing, they'll do the park over maybe or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5460.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: similar to the other projects that have taken place here within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/50f-AMbGHtg&t=5465.241s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, I look forward to the future dialogue on this particular matter, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3073.87s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you very much, and I want to thank you guys for coming here this evening for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3079.154s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3083.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I realize that it's a few years away from actually putting the shovel into the ground, but the City Council wants to make sure that the citizens know what's going on and what the timeline is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3094.684s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to thank you, Councilor Marks, and also President Dello Russo for getting them here so quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3102.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Within seven days, we're here with a great presentation, so look forward to the additional communication over the coming years, and we'll see where we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3112.095s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I do agree with Councilor Knight that we should have a public hearing here in the City of Medford, even if it's on top of other ones that may be mandated throughout the region that the project is taking place in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3124.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: even if it's separate and distinct, at least for our residents, to get the opportunity to be heard on this critical matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3168.402s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: While we're on suspension, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3171.003s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I move to take paper 15-486 for the young lady in the audience from the Mystic Valley that is here on a paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3259.092s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3260.533s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor, please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3262.094s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may, real quick on this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3265.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mayor McGlynn actually gave me a call this afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3268.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the paper that initiated here at the Medford City Council, and it's in direct correlation to the other stuff that Brooke and Penny are working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3280.185s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We will be one of the first communities in the area to have a full-time Office of Substance Abuse and Treatment Opportunity slash education, I'd like to assume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3293.951s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is a full-time position, I believe Boston, under the leadership of Mayor Walsh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3298.287s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: has a full-time position as well, but the mayor clearly worked with the council on this, and it is coming to fruition, so I wanna move approval on this, and it's a department head position for this particular matter before us, so I'd like to move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3351.888s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd like to motion to waive the three readings on this where it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3451.19s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: $75,000 and $79,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3451.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3452.071s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: CAF 12, step one, and then right through step five, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3455.672s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Department head level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3456.713s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Department head level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3457.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Same as the Director of Veterans Affairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3581.984s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, I will withdraw my motion, but just to be fair and full disclosure for the viewing public, this is only to put the title in the personnel ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3597.915s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Without us doing our job and approving this, there is no job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3602.057s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, I mean, the description may not even be done until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3606.777s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: after the mayor knows that there's full support of this council, but I'll withdraw the three readings and see where it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3611.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3621.827s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It says it right at the last line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3623.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The money is funded in the fiscal year 2016 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3631.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, according to what the mayor says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3635.796s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I withdrew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3690.33s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She told me that she was too, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3692.331s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She told me she was the director of personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3695.994s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And her salary was commensurate with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3699.116s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Also- Just to let you know- Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=3969.743s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: just so we get an idea of... Every city job description that goes on has that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4344.688s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, we asked for the dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4345.928s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I specifically asked for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4384.44s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, I would just like to go on record that although Councilor Pentlander's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4391.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: our motion, our thoughts regarding the same exact increases across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4397.501s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4398.721s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's unrealistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4400.242s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have lunch mothers, we have paraprofessionals that are making $11,000 a year, and then we also have other unions that are across the board that are making $100,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4409.866s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to say that there should be parity amongst every single union, I just think that at this point, that's what the unions do, as well as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4419.397s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the other side of management sitting at the table, and that is called negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4423.7s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you just look at the past several years, too, there's been situations where the city has gotten back language from contracts that were put in in 1980s and 1970s, taken six days back, or personal days, and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4437.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when that happens, usually the other side gets something back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4445.704s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's called negotiation, so although I agree with Councilor Penter, it sounds great, I just think that it's a little bit unrealistic where you can't compare the maxed out city worker and the maxed out lunch mother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4463.054s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's no equity when it comes to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4464.835s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The 3% raise on $11,000 is not paying the gas bill increase each month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4472.095s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I'd like to waive the three readings on this paper, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4584.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just to follow up with that, I think Councilor Penta just proved the point that I was trying to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4590.335s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you have a bargaining unit that hasn't got raises in eight years, like the lunch mothers, then the, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4598.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: raises should be commensurate with the length of time that surpassed since the last raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=4605.95s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to thank the councilor because I think we agree that my way is better on this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7627.501s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7629.582s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7630.102s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, you know, with the parking complaints, um, and businesses claiming that, um, there's not enough spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7636.565s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, this is probably an appropriate time to start looking at the garage again in Medford square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7642.387s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, the money is set aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7644.028s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: State representative has it in the bond bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7647.129s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um, I think that this is the appropriate time to actually start talking about it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7652.211s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7653.994s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There is a need for longer-term business parking within the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7659.296s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, I think the administration should take it under consideration, at least at this point, because the business owners that are complaining about not having spots, if there are additional spots that are allocated for long-term parking, and as I said in the past, the administration, it was another one of those issues that they just never brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7679.002s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They talked about it, and this and that, and the council talked about it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7682.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there has not been a proposal for the garage that's been before us for a vote for funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7688.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as I said, State Rep Donato has worked tirelessly to get funding in the transportation bond bill for that specific purpose, as well as other money that was set aside by, I believe, the previous administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7720.365s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I did not say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7721.426s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All I said was in the transportation bond bill, there's $3 million set aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7725.829s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: $8 million, Councilor Caraviello said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7730.432s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not exactly sure on the figure, but the bottom line is I think as one member of this council, there is a need for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7741.014s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we haven't had the opportunity to take a formal vote, whether we're for or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7745.796s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as I said, I'm urging the administration to bring it forward and finally give the people of Medford Square, the neighbors, the business owners, an opportunity to come down here and be heard, as people were given the opportunity to come down in the Brooks Estates, the new science labs, and the list goes on and on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7763.802s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Jot the Course, which was brought forward by the McGlynn administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7768.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This was part of it originally, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7770.165s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it just never came to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7771.565s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I think that we owe it at least to the business owners to take a long, serious look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7778.047s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And unfortunately, the people out there, the farmer garage was built under the old farmer government, where it was the city council and the city managers back in, I want to say the 80s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7788.49s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm sure Mayor McGlynn still has the plaque from the garage when it fell down with the names on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7795.632s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7799.842s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7801.744s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I, as one member of this council do support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7803.826s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I would hope that it at least entertain it and give the people the opportunity to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7858.718s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7860.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I may too, I'd just like to go on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7864.749s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know there is some frustration by some of the members of the Ticket Enforcement Unit, but there are several members of working for that company that are good, long-standing Medford families, Medford residents, and I think they're doing a fine and admirable job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7882.59s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You call that office, we all know who works up in the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7886.912s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A Medford gal and very friendly, two Medford gals, I didn't know the other one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7891.934s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then one of the enforcement officers is a Medford young man that grew up here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7899.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the ones that at least live in this community are taking pride in their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7904.298s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just want the record to reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7975.434s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7976.515s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The one thing that's been unanimous amongst the people that I talk to is they all look forward to Sunday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7983.497s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The day of rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7984.777s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think, on a serious note though, we brought it up a few weeks ago, the holiday has to be straightened out and it has to be a lot of public output because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7995.088s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There were people on Patriots Day, and you weren't here for the meeting, but people on Patriots Day were getting tickets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=7998.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, I know the company did write by it, but it has to be unison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8004.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is it the federal calendar, or is it the state calendar?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8007.814s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it should be the state calendar, because how can you justify having City Hall closed and the schools closed, but still be able to get a ticket?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8015.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And rubbish delivery doesn't get picked up, like Councilor Pender said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8018.56s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It should be all holidays on both schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8033.372s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Bunker Hill Day, though, City Hall is closed, so it should be closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8037.676s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8038.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8246.712s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8247.573s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8249.67s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I agree with a lot of the sentiments of Councilor Caraviello, but I also know there are a lot of two and three families that have significant amount of parking right on their own property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8260.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is a new way of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8264.902s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People don't want the big homes anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8266.403s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They want to buy a smaller condominium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8269.786s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just think the Board of Appeals has to look at each individual cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8273.489s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Similar to a few years ago when the Meadow Glen Mall sign came up, and I'm not far of those big signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8278.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But in certain areas, I think they're actually good and they bring business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8282.497s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But to tell someone that there's a moratorium in place, and if they have 7,500 square feet and they can fit the appropriate parking and-.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8304.57s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But a lot of times the conversions, I think the conversions and the board of appeals are two separate things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8310.292s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, a lot of times you don't even have to go to the board of appeals to convert to a, if you already own a two family, it's more or less just going to the building department and condo eyes in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8334.002s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But also, there are some buildings throughout our community that are currently zoned for more than the units that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8343.425s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They may have a zoning for a six-family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8345.945s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At the end of Irving Street, at the corner of Irving and Placestead, you've got six or seven units in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8351.527s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, is it appropriate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8353.707s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But it's conforming use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8355.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a conforming use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8356.837s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I agree with you that we have to actually take a long, hard look at it, but I think we have to leave it in the Board of Appeals hands, and they have to look at it individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8366.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because there are certain lots and properties within the community that take a blighted area, for instance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8375.949s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You'd rather have maybe a three or four family than the one family that's run as a rental place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8386.547s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's, I think, I just think the Board of Appeals right now is in a total, it's a good, it's a good, not it's a good, it's the only avenue where they can go and look at it realistically, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8401.656s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They are very, I'd say that they deny more than they approve developments and conversions in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8411.061s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, I'd like to know the statistics on it, too,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8414.21s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: How many of these properties have actually made it to the Board of Appeals and were approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=8419.593s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, that's something that I'd like to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9226.888s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That evening, I believe the company was, was it DTZ?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9230.03s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We were well aware that it was a contracted company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9232.752s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They got up here and represented themselves as a contracted company and members of SEIU, Service Employees International United.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9241.079s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, I understand they're not employees at Tufts Universities, but it doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9244.541s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We would try to, we would try to, no it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9246.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So what, if they were Tufts University employees, we don't want them getting laid off, but because they have to work, because they happen to work for an outside entity, we, okay, let them go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9253.764s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, I don't see any difference in that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9277.055s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Once again, once again, the more Councilor Penta talks, he backs up what I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9282.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's twice this evening you've done what I've tried to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9285.602s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Earlier in the evening, you contradicted me, and then in the end, you end up agreeing with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9292.909s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's kind of, I find it kind of comical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9295.571s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, Madam President, with this particular issue, I would like to, the motion before us is to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9304.223s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's been plenty of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9305.884s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if the council is going to bring forward a motion other than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9309.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But to go one step further, I know firsthand from going to the Board of Appeals over the years and following the rulings and stuff, and I'm sure you know this as well as a congratulations being one of the top female attorneys in the area, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9327.919s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Vice President Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9329.823s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, the Board of Appeals, I'd like to find out how many of these were approved over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9337.967s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would say it's less than 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9339.607s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for us to sit here and say it's changing the fabric of our entire community, matter of fact, we had someone, and I'm not going to use the name, but was going for one of these who worked for the United States Senator's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9351.673s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At the time, it was a congressman's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9353.634s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9355.155s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9357.565s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So this is not a major problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9359.888s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, this particular one, I don't know where 198 and 202 Harvard Street is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9363.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not going to get into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9364.172s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not going to discuss it prior to going down and maybe looking at the property and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9369.358s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, the Board of Appeals, I think it's incumbent upon us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9373.424s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Rather than to sit here and say it's changing the fact the the character of all our neighborhoods I think we have to ask the question How many of these were approved over say the last 10 years and if it's more than a dozen, I will be shocked shocked in a city of our size I'm pretty sure it's less than a dozen because they are very very strict and anyone that knows anything about the Board of Appeals There's only a few criteria<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9399.058s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that they can actually approve something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9401.48s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One is when it's created a hardship, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9404.762s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And what's the other one, Mr. Clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9406.343s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do you know off the top of your head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9407.744s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's if there's a financial hardship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9411.567s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's the main one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9416.167s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think we spent 45 minutes on an issue that Councilor Caraviello is probably right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9422.312s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know he does his due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9423.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He drives around more than any councillors that sit here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9427.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he checks out all the properties that he brings up and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9430.499s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as I said, I'd like to reserve my judgment on that particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9435.804s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I'd like to make a motion, if you don't mind, on how many of these were actually approved in the last 10 fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9444.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then we can actually tell if there's a major problem in the community, and we should be putting in some sort of zoning ordinance or zoning law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9452.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But knowing that board, I will be shocked, like I said, if it's more than a dozen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9456.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because I get more phone calls of the projects that get denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9461.421s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And sometimes they're legitimate reasons, but just the hardship or whatever criteria that needs to be met is not met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9468.586s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know Attorney Arena, he is so tight when it comes to ethical standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9475.362s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's amazing, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9692.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Obviously, about a month or two ago, we had a detective from the Medford Police Department here, and to say a crack house can pop up, we have these problems in every single neighborhood in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9707.202s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Every single neighborhood in this city, we have problems when it comes to people selling drugs out of a certain house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9712.865s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to say it's as a result of these or that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9718.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: what's the word, not when they condoize it, when it goes from a two to three, conversion, exactly, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9724.849s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To say that it's as a result of conversion, Forest Street may have been one particular case, but we've had a drug bust on Wareham Street, $40,000, a gun, heroin, and everything else within the last seven days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9739.192s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have other drug busts within the last three or four months up in North Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9744.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The detective that was here a few weeks ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9746.244s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: talked about how each and every councillor, and he knows where all of us live, within walking distance of all of our own houses, there's been drug arrests from residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9773.053s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, I'll tell you one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9774.51s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I had a situation near my house where my family's growing up and it is a crack house and there was a potential for development to come in and make it maybe a two-family house or something else, I would go to the Board of Appeals and I would support the conversion with the hopes of having the crack house vacated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9794.161s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So in some cases, this is actually good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9798.363s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Look at Boynton Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9799.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We've been talking about Boynton Road, number 56 Boynton Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9802.812s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If there was a conversion that could take place that would be good in that neighborhood, I'm sure Mr. Crowley would be here and his neighbors to speak on behalf of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9812.276s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there is particular cases where you're better off taking a conversion than dealing with some of the nonsense that goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9818.479s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know in Councilor Caraviello's neighborhood, there's a house that there's overdoses in weekly, weekly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9824.322s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People going in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9825.342s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, Councilor Caraviello, what was it, two deaths or one death there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9829.564s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Two deaths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9830.94s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sure the neighbors would want that to be converted if someone came in and wanted to clean up the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9837.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9839.303s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there is cases that the Board of Appeals should take into consideration, and they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9848.665s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'd like to get that number, though, because I think we're all going to be surprised by the small, small amount of approvals for conversions from a single family or a two family or a three family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9860.232s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So any conversion higher, what's the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9862.813s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We got to ask the actual question rather than get it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9864.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We didn't understand the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9866.693s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Any conversion that added a different, an additional unit, a single to a, a single to a two, a two to a three, a three to a four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=9877.256s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10140.012s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10143.034s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that that's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10144.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we have a code enforcement department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10146.374s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A lot of times, most of the complaints come from actual neighbors that will see additional vehicles and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10152.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unfortunately, as we all know, as city councilors, we don't find out all the time about these illegal units until it goes to sell or they're doing a home inspection or doing the appraisal for the taxes, which we're going through right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10171.115s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: City actually sends someone in the house and they're looking for stoves in the basement and stuff in the basement that would indicate that it's... But I'd say 90% of them, and we've heard this from our building department, comes from neighbors' complaints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10184.766s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So they do take them very serious when it does come up, but if they don't know, they can't do anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ufepi4QYj4&t=10190.33s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=931.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=932.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=934.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, and I want to commend Councilor Marks for bringing this up this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=938.566s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is certainly going to have a major impact on our community, as is the Credit Bridge, which will be going on roughly around the same time, I assume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=948.654s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But that project is so convoluted as far as timelines and timeframes, I'm just assuming at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=956.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I like Councilor Marks, all his recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=961.725s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=963.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: According to the Councilor, there's no mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=966.051s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the past, Algonquin Gas paid mitigation, but I'm not sure of the specifics of that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=972.214s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if that's something we can look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=975.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I want to thank the Councilor for bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=977.917s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On a side note, if the Councilor doesn't mind, or I can make it a separate paper, can we ask for the MBTA to come in at this point with another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=991.146s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: idea slash proposal for moving the bus stop across from Medford Auto School down here in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=998.188s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We need to get that done prior to the construction commencing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1002.569s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1044.463s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's Committee of the Whole for the Craddock Bridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1046.785s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Our Committee of the Whole for the Craddock Bridge, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1049.167s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Either way, it's not going to be fair to the consumers and the people that utilize public transportation to find out two days before a shovel's on the ground that now they have to go to place X or Y or Z to catch transportation to get to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1066.34s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could call that Committee of the Whole in a fairly reasonable time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1070.564s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Last but not least, if we could also send to the Committee of the Whole<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1074.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We got a paper this evening, and if we want to bring this up at a different agenda item, I would put something on, but if we can, if the Councilor sees it as fit to just refer the paper from Cassandra Koudelidis, telling us that at roughly $4 million to resurface and to mill and pave Boston Ave, Forest Street, High Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, the part that the city owns, as well as Riverside Avenue, Salem Street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1104.507s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I, as one member of this council, we have a lot of money in reserves right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1108.711s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We also have a great bond rating due to the good fiscal management that's been going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1114.715s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think these roads need to be resurfaced once and for all, and I think that's a project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1119.138s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know as one member of the council, I would support a bond initiative or using some of the reserves for the $4 million to do a complete infrastructure improval<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1132.505s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: improvement rather on these streets and these are main thoroughfares and it actually equates to what did she say as far as mileage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1141.652s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 58,000 linear feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1144.194s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's 265,000 square feet of paving and milling that would take place and it's something that I think we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1153.041s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now the good question would be to ask the engineer is this something that we should wait to do until after the project that Councilor Marks is referring to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1160.762s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: two years down the road, or is it, because I'm not an engineer, I don't know, they talked about five feet underground and stuff, but is it five feet, I don't know, so would it make sense to do a major initiative like this after this project, or wait until?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1175.891s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Why don't we talk to the city engineer, and then call the appropriate meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1180.174s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do you mind if that's a B paper, Councilor, or do you want me to put it on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1182.976s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's all part of the main paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1186.738s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you again to Councilor Marks for bringing this important item up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2280.354s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2282.275s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2284.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2285.536s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, are you a volunteer at Mass Resistance, or are you a paid consultant or an employee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2300.262s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Mass Resistance, I've known about it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2306.292s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: exactly what type of things do you guys lobby behind, and it's mostly family issues, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2331.568s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now, the Parents' Rights Coalition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2335.568s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Was it under them, I think it was under that name, that you were strong opposition to the same-sex marriage and put up on Beacon Hill and it was brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2345.796s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2346.397s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Was that that organization or the new one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2356.326s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, mass resistance is very much<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2360.259s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: behind in opposition to same-sex marriage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2364.423s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe as recent as within the last few weeks with the court case up in Washington, D.C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2368.686s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2371.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2371.408s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2374.031s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just wanted to get a better understanding on what we're looking at supporting this evening, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2379.955s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly, I don't know much about the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2385.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as Councilor Knight alluded to a few weeks ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2388.91s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The democratic process, as you know, it can be a bill that's submitted one way, and by the end, by the time it hits the governor's desk, it's totally different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2396.933s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's the democratic and legislative process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2399.614s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, at this point, I will not be supporting this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2403.275s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just as a point of... And thank you very much for... Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2412.018s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand that, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that the legislative process, you can start out with the text and the verbiage of one bill being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2419.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A, B, C, D, and then by the end of it, it's totally extrapolated, things added, things taken out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2424.344s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I understand, and I have my own personal feelings about the surveys in the public schools, but I'm certainly not going to take a vote based upon my own personal feelings, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2436.793s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And number two, I just, I don't know where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2441.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would feel better seeing how it comes out of committee, if it comes out of committee, and then saying whether we support it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2448.917s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know in the past, some of the initiatives that mass resistance has been adamantly against the same sex marriage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2455.241s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm on the other side of the issue on that particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2458.544s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And at this point, I just don't have enough information to be quite frank with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2462.666s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I don't feel comfortable supporting something early on as this in the legislative process, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2528.062s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, I appreciate the council is, um, um, opinions, but as I stated, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2535.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just in our own homeroom petitions, by the time things get to the governor's desk, it's changed tremendously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2541.624s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We've dealt with that, as Councilor Penta said, right here, with stuff that was initiated in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2546.847s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was a lot of changes by the time it left the city clerk's office with the mayor and the council signatures on it, all the way to the time it got back to Governor Deval Patrick's desk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2555.714s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And for that reason, I'm not supporting this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3021.612s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3023.792s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, just for the gentlemen, um, I believe, I don't know if it was you or one of my council colleagues said that Medford did notify the parents, but it was vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3037.116s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So Medford is following the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3038.656s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If, if that's the case, we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3040.556s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're getting told secondhand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3041.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm getting told third hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3347.788s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3350.889s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just one more question for the gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3352.91s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe, was this the same group that I believe you were successful<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3358.887s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in the early 2000s, blocking Governor Cellucci's ambassadorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3368.553s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, no, no, but it was until he agreed to no longer do anything that would protect the rights of homosexual activity in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3377.698s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I remember a landmark, something to do with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3381.5s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There was a human foreign relations subcommittee at the time, and I believe it was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3387.319s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The group might be the national group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3394.643s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Senator Jesse Helms at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3395.963s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's who it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4090.998s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Sorry, president council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4092.558s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, it may be appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4095.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It may not be appropriate to bring it up at this point, but we received the budget this evening with a $5 million increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4101.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: $5 million increase from the previous year's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4105.17s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Obviously, Tamar said that the additional money needed for the accreditation is not included in that line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4112.814s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But more importantly, the city council has been asking for months now for the transfers of all the transfers of municipal funds in to and from accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4124.801s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we have not received that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4127.085s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: How do we look at the budget realistically if we don't know how much money was transferred to and from line items that they're being presented to us in the next month and a half?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4137.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4139.348s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then at the end of the year, we're going to get another slew of transfers to balance this year's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4144.969s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4147.029s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm surprised we haven't had them already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4148.75s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We got a paper tonight from Ann Baker answering us the projected revenues<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4155.661s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that was the B paper to my original transfer paper request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4160.824s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So they answered the B paper because they wanted to, but the transfer paper that was the original paper that was brought up that that amendment was put on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4170.368s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a beautiful report tonight on the amendment, but the amendment doesn't tell us a picture on how much money is being transferred to and from accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4180.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is simple for the regular person viewing at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4184.362s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you have a checking account, a savings account, and another checking account, and you transfer the money in between accounts by doing online banking, unless you actually look where the money came from, where it's going, and for what intent it's spended for, you're not going to know the actual balances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4205.535s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's the budget we got tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4208.097s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Without the transfers, take the fiscal year budget we're in and throw it out the window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4212.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Throw it out the window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4214.312s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We know what's been encumbered, what's projected to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4217.556s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But other than that, and we know there are accounts that are in the arrears right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4223.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know exactly which ones, but I'm assuming it's overtime accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4227.006s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm assuming it's other accounts out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4229.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And unless we have a full accounting of all the transfers, it's unrealistic budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4237.218s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as I talked about a few weeks ago, we have $6 million, $6 million plus in certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4243.163s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's certified because we didn't expend that money that was raised in previous fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4252.87s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the DOR certified us to go ahead and put it in certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4259.294s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that $6 million that was appropriated on the backs of the taxpayers for several years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4266.611s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to get a savings, to put the city in a financially good spot for debt consolidation and other wonderful things that have happened over the past few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4278.117s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the transfer paper is a very, very important piece of my moving forward in either supporting or not supporting a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4288.09s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, and this budget's going to be very, very interesting in particular, too, because with a new administration, we don't know, this is where we can craft where we think the city should be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4299.6s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OCD, I think, should be boosted up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4303.063s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have to give the new administration the tools to do their vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4310.429s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They may say that certain officers don't need X amount of people, and other areas need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4316.783s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4317.604s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't know who's going to be in that corner office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4319.825s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the fact of the matter is, Mr. President, I think we need to have those transfers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4325.068s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think the transfers tell us exactly how much money of — and I want to say this the correct way — how much money that was put aside for a specific purpose at the end of June last year was actually spent on that specific purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4344.799s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just for the viewing public, too,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4346.969s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The city council has to make transfers, and according to Massachusetts finance law, the only time the city council has to make the transfers, if it's from one account that's totally different from another account, if it's from the police to the fire, or from information technology to the city clerk, interdepartmental transfers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4369.515s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't have any control or any say, and nor does the administration need any vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4376.583s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: regarding transfers internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4378.304s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So they could put money in an account that's called water cooler for $5,000 say, and they can take that out and use it for something else without the city council needing to approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4388.311s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I hopefully that gives a good picture to people out there on how the budget actually works, where the certified free cash that we all talk about comes from, and more importantly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4400.41s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the budget that we pass, if it indeed is being spent in the areas where we put our stamp of approval on by a majority vote of the duly elected members of the Medford City Council year after year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4412.821s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would say, Mr. President, that I think you have to send the message to the city administration that without that paper, don't even bother showing up to a budget hearing, honestly, because we've been asking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4424.711s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to get the B paper answered,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4427.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and not the original paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4428.702s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's, it's kind of humorous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4486.361s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And now, Mr. President, one last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4489.962s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know it comes up during budget hearing, but Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4491.783s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Siegel this evening as well referenced it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4494.945s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we also could see where the status is, if any, of the waiver going forward as well, because we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4503.189s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know in the past years we've had one after the waiver, but is that the intention this year to go after the waiver again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4509.912s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I think that's part of the question that should be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4571.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Transfer some money, buy a new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4781.49s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: th th th th<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4876.308s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: next year next year see ya Ricky<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5171.823s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. President, Mr. Councilor, why we're under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5174.745s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can we take 15-four, five, six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5176.987s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know there's some, um, viewers at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5179.535s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in the Grove Street area on the mausoleum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5396.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5398.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I believe, first of all, this was initiated by Councilor Marks about four or five years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5406.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Four years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5408.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was on the end of the agenda ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5411.07s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just till recently, I believe we received the request for the $30,000 for the feasibility study from the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5419.012s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I think we really got to get a good understanding, too, on how the mausoleums actually work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5427.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penta brought up a very valid point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5429.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Where exactly is it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5431.266s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The second piece of the puzzle is, I'm not quite sure if public cemeteries are in the business normally of managing a mausoleum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5442.228s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know a lot of the private cemeteries, it seems, has them more than, is that fair to say, Councilor, based upon your professional?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5448.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay, so that is true, that it's the private<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5453.838s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: cemeteries that seem to have Management of these a lot more than the other thing is to I want to get an idea how much it's gonna cost for a Medford family Some of the numbers that you hear are pretty significant For this so I just think we should have a meeting and I agree with councillor Penta just to find out Where we're going with this as a whole as councillor night did say though the and I agree with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5480.449s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is strictly a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5482.312s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: under the jurisdiction of the Cemetery Board of Trustees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5486.254s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unless they're looking for bonding through the City Council, that is where our official action would be needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5493.677s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'm glad we're talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6792.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, we're still waiting on an opinion from the city solicitor that we asked for probably several months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6798.852s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This whole thing could be moot if the Medford city council injects, um, a recension of the original vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6806.211s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that was taken way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6809.152s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We asked for a ruling, whether it was a new contract or an extension of the contract, or if it was by home rule petition, or if it was by a separate law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6822.394s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I believe we're still waiting for that opinion from the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6825.655s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's been very busy providing us other opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6828.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But that one, I think, should be put to the front of the list, where this is something that's ongoing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6856.492s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So we're calling the role on the, well, did the chair rule that this is contradictory to the vote last week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6864.354s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You did say that you agreed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6868.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm just asking a question of the chair, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6875.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not reaffirming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6876.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6890.902s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The extension was signed on April 15, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6895.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, the ascertainment hearing was May<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7541.012s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As a result of not having our answers for the transfers, motion to table the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7577.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7578.89s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7591.051s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion to revert back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9821.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9822.529s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know who I really feel bad for in this whole debacle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9825.394s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is the business owners on those three properties that are affected by a contaminated lot that is owned by the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9833.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that the administration was doing their due diligence to see if there was insurance policies in place to go back and go after whoever contaminated this land 80 years ago, but the fact of the matter is these businesses are suffering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9849.508s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You go into any of those businesses and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9853.411s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They have the breathing, sorry, they have the equipment in them to make sure that they're breathing quality air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9860.614s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're having the levels tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9863.455s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9865.476s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have to have some sort of a plan for this as a community, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9870.378s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If indeed it's gonna be costing the amount of money they're saying to do this, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9875.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Take all three properties by eminent domain, do a whole development, and at the same time you clean it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9882.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You clean it up, and you give these people back somehow, some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9885.634s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know you work it out that the current owners would be paid for the value of their land, but they'd also be given an opportunity in the new development, whatever it may be, to do the same type of establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9902.038s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9903.639s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First right of refusal and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9906.14s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9909.52s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's where the vision comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9911.779s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You don't have to, it's like Locust Street, when people say, we gotta do some rezoning down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9916.163s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9917.064s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Locust Street in that area can be reconfigured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9919.506s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't have to remain Locust Street, a straight shot from Mystic Valley Parkway to Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9924.09s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It can be called the Saks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9925.17s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It can be a shopping area on the Mystic River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9929.975s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a lot of options down there, but this is where vision comes into place, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9935.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the business owners, I'm sorry, the property owners,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9939.374s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's coming to a point now where they're lucky that this hasn't put some of them out of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9945.98s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The amount of money and funding and time and energy that they've put into this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10035.002s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, I'm talking about Paul Camuso's vision, not the mayor or anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10038.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is Paul Camuso's vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10041.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Think about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10043.195s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have money that's set aside right now in a transportation bond bill for the garage in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10048.397s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We could put some sort of parking down there that could abut the train station, where it currently exists on the other side of the tracks, so the train doesn't even have to stop anymore and basically cause the confusion that it does, and it stops for 20 minutes when it's an inbound train.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10063.68s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's stuff to be done down there, potentially, by using some of these monies and capital that's put aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10070.278s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, but unless you get engaged in the conversation and talk about bringing a real solution to the table, we're just going to keep having conversations about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10080.284s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is a real good opportunity for a public-private partnership to get together for the city to purchase the land in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10088.989s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sorry, the buildings that's directly around the land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10097.294s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You clean up the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10099.134s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And then you turn around and you put it up for bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10102.916s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And here's the other thing, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10106.438s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we're doing that, a developer can come in and put a garage underground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10110.681s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A garage underground in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10112.322s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Add another 200 spots to West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10116.405s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is all stuff that should be talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10120.847s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10121.508s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, you look at that specific land, it's perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10124.409s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's like a triangle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10125.769s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's got the building where Snappy Patty's is, you have the liquor store and the hair salon, and then you have the building out behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10132.213s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got a good acre, acre and a half of land there if you put it all together with very, very, very good potential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10138.777s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right now, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10140.698s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a sick area that is going to cost us millions of dollars to clean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10144.18s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's try to come up with something to clean it up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10147.756s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm sure the business owners too, and we certainly can't speak to them, file them, because this is just quick thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10155.912s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the liquor store, for instance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10161.484s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They get a brand new site to operate his current business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10163.925s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're going to have more environmentally friendly coolers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10166.306s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're going to have more environmentally friendly business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10169.787s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're going to have more environmentally friendly cooling systems, heating and HVAC air conditioners, and just the regular heating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10178.01s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, monthly expenses will go down with a new development there for the current landowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10184.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is where you have to have a vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10189.142s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Like I said, Locust Street, I think we're missing the boat on Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10193.404s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's why I didn't support another auto body shop down there a year and a half ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10199.067s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because Locust Street is a premier spot to get a good development like a Stations Landing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10204.73s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No one ever thought Stations Landing would be as beautiful as it is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10209.232s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10209.892s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What was Stations Landing previously known for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10212.314s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Going down to get your Christmas trees, going to Bickford's, and then going to Strawberries to get a new record of tape when it came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10217.356s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10219.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10219.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Richard's car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10221.199s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Richard's car hop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10221.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're a little bit older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10223.441s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, but with that being said, uh, that, that, that had some vision and there's no reason why some other of these other areas in our community that are blighted somewhat or environmentally sick can't be done in the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10235.51s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Look at the DPW yard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10236.851s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The DPW yard looks beautiful now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3447.398s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you have specific questions for the chamber, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3786.965s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the last paperwork they sent us was on a CD, which was about over 100 pages long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8082.689s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Martin, I don't want to cut you off, but some of these things you're talking about, the police department does deal with these very specific on very limited occasions when it does happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8094.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To make the inception that the police don't deal with any... Oh, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8253.85s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Any details that are in the West Medford area, when something happens at Medford High School that's a serious situation, it will be additional bodies that were not working in the city of Medford responding to a catastrophic event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8264.358s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the details provide a tremendous value to the people in this community, not monetary,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8270.029s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but public safety-wise, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8272.871s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8293.585s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: More than today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8322.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just to play the devil's advocate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8324.178s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe there's not a lot of people here because there are many people in this community out of that 57,000 that think we have one of the best police departments around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=46.437s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Be it resolved that the Department of Public Work repaint the crosswalks at Method Street and Albion Street in the interest of public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=53.541s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Del Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=54.682s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=56.302s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As the weather gets nicer, the DPW is embarking upon the repainting of the crosswalks, specifically Medford Street and Albion Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=64.746s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very busy intersection, and a lot of the children in the South Medford neighborhood use that to get to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=70.549s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if they can get that on the top of the list when they're out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=75.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Vice President Del Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=109.709s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's amended by vice president Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=244.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=244.965s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's a wonderful question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=246.525s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, but when citizens of Medford that walk that area every day, reach out to any of their elected officials in the community, it's our job to respond in a favorable manner to get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=256.983s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as long as people continue to call me regarding city issues, I'm going to keep bringing them up, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=262.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we don't pick and choose issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=264.27s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I stated in my brief speech, as they're embarking on painting all the crosswalks, but this is one is particular public safety concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=309.578s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In front of the pool and also on Medford Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1084.133s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It is something that we need to have answers to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1087.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that some of the locations that were suggested got a little pushback from some of the neighbors because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1095.578s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The dog park is great, but when you look at an area like the Sheepfold, it's very secluded, it's out of the way, people don't have to hear the dogs barking at 6 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1104.365s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and the feces on the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1107.848s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, with that being said, I think there has to be some sort of a committee with neighborhood input from any area that the mayor may be proposing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8327.455s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Council, what is this regarding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8328.896s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8329.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As we're all aware, Hormel Stadium was recently updated with the track facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8335.442s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the senior citizens that do the walking club in the morning at the Meadow Glen Mall, they want to have the track opened up so that they can do it outdoors now that the weather's getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8345.832s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And with the staffing levels at the DPW, they should be able to accommodate this, at least during the working business hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8354.042s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Isn't it open for walking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8355.303s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's open, only set a couple of hours a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8358.745s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there's no reason why it can't be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8377.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, not 24 hours, because you have to worry about vandalism and stuff, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8385.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, they can open at 7 o'clock in the morning, can't they?<br><br>
