    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2295.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Getting used to this Zoom stuff, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2298.841s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2303.453s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, I want to thank Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on, you know, as, as a former athlete at Medford High School, I love to see that we're trying diverse to diversify the athletic programs and the recreational programs in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2320.246s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a few years ago we were very lucky to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2323.208s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: get the recreation department into full swing, you know, and to expand it to include more diverse opportunities for Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2331.176s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just a win-win, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2334.038s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I really think that this is going to take off, you know, you look at the Barchi court, the old Italian Americans love Barchi for the most part, and a lot of other people are now becoming<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2344.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: part of that bocce league at not only the boat club, but also the new bocce courts here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2351.131s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For many, many years, people would go over to the Italian club over in Malden to participate in bocce and to see bocce and now pickleball come to fruition, I think it's a great opportunity for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2362.555s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Furthermore, just on a side note, we have a lot of snowbirds in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2366.557s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The biggest voting blocks and the biggest group in this community, when you look at the numbers, are the senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2373.942s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to give them more opportunity to enjoy their golden years of retirement, I think you have to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2379.305s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I really appreciate you making an effort to put this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2382.587s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On another side note, my mom is a snowbird, as most of you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2386.049s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And down in Naples, they actually have a tournament that brings in thousands upon thousands of people that play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2392.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And they actually set up professional pickleball courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2394.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a big facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2396.195s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And three years ago when I visited my mom, I never even heard of pickleball, but it certainly is something that's taken off, not only here, but down in Florida where the retirees go down and enjoy the nice warm winters that we unfortunately don't have up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2412.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just wanted to go on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2414.219s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If I could too, as a former member of the council and a parent of a student in the Medford Public Schools, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2421.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I used to put this on yearly when I was a member of your honorable body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2425.542s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but I think the safety audit of all the parks to make sure, especially now, because once the parks are up and running, I think you're gonna have more people out there this year than ever due to the fact of the COVID-19 situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2437.811s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if you could, somebody think about putting on the agenda or making a paper to have the parks department do the safety audit, just to go through the entire facility structures and check all the nuts and bolts so that we can prevent injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2450.34s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2451.501s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: no win, it's a win-win for the community and we can't go wrong when we're trying to provide safety to the senior citizens and in this particular case, the youth of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2462.046s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So once again, thank you to Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2466.349s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I like when you guys think outside the box, you get down there on Tuesday night and you do the people's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2471.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2473.612s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And on another note,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2475.333s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You guys are showing leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2477.154s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're showing people that the country can still move forward under this devastating vaccine program that's before us now in the COVID situation by showing up on Tuesday nights and getting the people's business done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2489.161s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The continuity of government has to be paramount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2493.323s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the people that are there tonight are doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2494.884s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3182.794s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3185.443s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3188.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thanks again, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3189.986s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just I'd like to make a quick comment on the upcoming elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3193.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We all know that with COVID and the last few election cycles, there's been some movement around the VFW is no longer a polling place, as well as some other minor moves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3205.175s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The temple, excuse me, not the temple, the American Legion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3209.837s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think it's important that you get the message out via all the communication<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3214.901s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3216.564s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Some people received ballots last election that didn't put in for a mail-in ballot like myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3220.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I actually brought that to the attention of the city clerk at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3224.159s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think there has to be a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3226.267s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: very good PR push to let everybody know what's going on, just because there's so many moving parts with COVID and the secretary of state just filed a bill for mail-in voting to become permanent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3237.231s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So whatever direction it goes in, I just think the public needs to know, because not everybody picks up the Boston Globe and reads the papers and does all their research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3246.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's incumbent upon this city to do that aspect of notifications, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2548.016s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2549.817s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford Mass, here in our fine community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2555.54s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, I want to thank the Honorable Vice President Knight for bringing this up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2560.324s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is an issue that has been championed for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2563.867s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I remember Councilor Marks bringing up this very particular issue when I was a member of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2569.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is an easy fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2571.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This isn't something that has to be long debated like the issue that I appeared on last week, which has, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2578.9s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: brought up several more issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2580.121s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I've been called from community members regarding Oak Grove Cemetery, for instance, regarding that matter in cleaning up the leaves in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2586.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'll be at the committee of the whole meeting to discuss that, because I know my loved ones are very concerned about the leaves at Oak Grove Cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2592.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is something that can be done easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2595.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the rents down there at Fellsway Plaza are in the area of $30,000 plus a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2600.835s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They have made several beautification projects on that facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2606.111s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but I have to agree with Mr. Poli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2609.252s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The people of Wellington do not deserve to look at that albatross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2612.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I remember last year there was a fire out there right behind that box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2616.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Someone threw a cigarette, the mulch went up and then half of the box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2620.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We need to do what we have to do to maintain our neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2623.638s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The top job as a city councilor is meeting the needs of the constituents in all these neighborhoods throughout the community and the councilors that are sitting there doing just that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2631.781s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I wanna commend you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2634.322s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Furthermore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2636.795s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: on a few other upcoming agenda items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2640.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that it's important to keep doing the people's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2644.7s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, we're showing a continuity in government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2646.641s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People are down there doing the people's business week after week, and it doesn't go unnoticed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2650.903s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just wanna tell you, councilors, this pandemic is slowing a lot of things down, but the Medford City Council is still meeting at City Hall on Tuesday nights, getting the job done that you're voted in there to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2661.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I wanna commend all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2663.45s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you very much for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3109.641s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3110.822s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, once again, 114 Lincoln Road here in our fine community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3115.927s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3119.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is a very unique opportunity for the city of Medford to bring in new non-tax revenue, which is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3126.598s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, this is the revenues that we should be going after, not trying to take more money out of people's pockets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3132.323s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that might be living on fixed incomes and other things throughout this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3136.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this is a unique opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3138.369s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have to try to maximize and hold the people that wanna come in accountable to benefit this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3146.236s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I would have liked to seen this done over the last two or three years before other communities had this off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3152.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For whatever reason, it stalled under the past city solicitor, but I'm glad you guys got it to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3157.947s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: point where we're at today, working with the administration, and I think you have to bring in value with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3163.97s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's going to be a good opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3166.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's overwhelmingly been supported by the voters in our community, so it's a good source of new non-tax revenue to bring in that can do many good things in this community under the leadership of the mayor's office and this honorable body by putting the money to good use where you see fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3184.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's get going and get out there and bring home the bacon as they say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3189.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thanks guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7585.195s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hi, my name is Paul Canuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7589.756s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, good evening to the Honorable City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7593.657s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd just like to go on record, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7597.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7598.958s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We hear a lot lately of looking for additional ways to raise revenues and whether it's going to be a proposition two and a half or a debt exclusion by certain members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7610.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm all for things to make our city better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7613.062s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But what I'm not for is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7615.682s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, there's, this is a, this is, this as a proposed, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, it's going to be an additional tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7624.67s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I talked to my landscaper who does about 25 houses on our street, and they're talking about an extra a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars per household, because if they have to use rakes and not the proper equipment to do the job, then they're not going to be able to do it for the same price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7640.163s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I'd rather see our money go towards the schools, go towards the fire department, the police department, and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7647.348s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With all due respect, I think that this is an overshot of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7651.912s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that this is going to put a burden on people that take their homes and their beautiful homes and try to make them better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7658.657s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, if the landscape prices keep going up, you're going to see people not getting it done because it's unaffordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7665.602s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I don't want to see that happen in my community that I love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7668.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think this is an overstep of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7670.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I really believe that we should take a step back and really look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7674.97s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you drive by homes in this community, people can't maintain the properties as they are in some occasions, and it's not fair to the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7682.714s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I just wanted to go on record in absolutely opposing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7687.817s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think you're gonna hear from a lot of the landscapers in the community, the DPW, and Michael Marks, you're right on target, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7693.84s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: How can you say that the city can do them next to Morrison Park, Placestead Park, and other parks, but you can't have your home cleaned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7700.643s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It doesn't make sense, Mr. President, but I just wanted to go on record and be against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7705.406s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you for taking the time to listen to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13005.509s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13007.73s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know it's been a long evening for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13010.191s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13014.273s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But thank you for calling on me, Mr. President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13019.015s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I speak from my experience as a member of the school committee and as a city councilor for about 16 years here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13028.36s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First of all, the budget that we received, I want to thank the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13031.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Read it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13033.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's got a lot of information, a total overhaul of budgets of years past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13039.867s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm glad that it was presented in the format that it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13043.551s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a great collaboration from all the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13047.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The narratives were great and the charts and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13051.177s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But as far as the discussion that's going on regarding meeting in Zoom and meeting in the council chambers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13061.04s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I absolutely understand that there is a lot of value in meeting at the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13067.445s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, yeah, when you have to look people in the eye on tough debates and things of that nature, and quite honestly, after watching this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13077.159s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and some other meetings that are on Zoom, the decorum, the Robert's Rules of Order are in place for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13083.341s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's a lot easier to keep an orderly meeting, I think, if you're at a public meeting rather than on Zoom, just because the technology is a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13094.385s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, I do not envy any of you guys during this COVID time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13099.107s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This city has stepped up amazingly, the city council, the mayor's office, the school department, everybody, to meet the needs of the people in our community with this COVID-19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13108.75s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's unprecedented, as we all know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13112.071s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think that somewhere along the line, and I really got to credit the entire council tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13119.415s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for the motion that was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13120.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe it's basically for like a mediation with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13123.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know if that's the correct word to use, but Marianne O'Connor, who I've had the privilege of knowing over the years, she is a consummate professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13131.142s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and as well as the members of the school committee, the council, the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13135.764s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If there's a way to do a hybrid model, I think it would be the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13139.906s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just because of the fact, like you said, people can have both, you can come down there if your health allows you to, and you can also participate on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13149.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The one good thing that I am encouraged by this evening is the participation, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13155.712s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The name calling and stuff that was allowed to happen tonight on all sides of this issue, it's not Medford that we can be proud of, to be quite frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13164.535s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We should all be working together to move Medford forward in a way that we all love Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13169.917s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whether you've been here for a hundred years or you've been here for a hundred days, it doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13173.978s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You moved here because you like something in this community and it can always be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13178.052s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It can always be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13180.193s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I suggest, like I said, I hope tomorrow Vice President Caraviello, President Falco, with the mayor and other people can sit down and let cooler heads prevail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13190.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One thing that has been frustrating on Zoom, just when I've watched it, is sometimes they have to call the roll three, four, five times to find out how people are voting and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13200.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The technology is iffy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13202.904s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13204.714s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand that it's a good tool, but at the same token, it's something that can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13210.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: whether it's a slow internet connection on a specific night or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13214.416s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, it does, does can get challenging, you know, but, uh, for our community, for the Medford that we all love, let cooler heads prevail and, uh, let's get the budget and do it, uh, do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13226.426s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I, and I just would like to, uh, hopefully it's a hybrid if we can do it in a safe manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13230.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, as far as both sides of the issue, I understand, I understand both sides of the issue, but I cannot state loud enough the value of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13240.135s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: having a meeting with people once it's safe to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13244.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would encourage you, would strongly encourage you guys to try to do some sort of hybrid model, because this might be another year before we're out of the woods with COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13255.609s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The numbers are going up and down as we see all over the country right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13259.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't know where we're gonna be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13261.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The city has done a tremendous job getting the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13265.59s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the PPE out there and things of that nature, working with the partners in federal and state government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13270.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But we don't know where we're going down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13272.512s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So people's individual needs can be met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13275.273s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I've always been a big person for meeting the individual needs of constituents as we all are when we're elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13282.434s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if we have both, I think it would be the best because I think the decorum, most importantly, would be brought back to a place that we can all be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13293.325s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in a setting less virtual, but also virtual for the people that do have health needs that may need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13300.171s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's all I have tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13302.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And once again, just good luck with this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13304.675s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Budget time is never easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13306.62s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Back in early 2000, I was around when there was a serious budget crisis when you were on the school committee council, Falco, and we worked together and we did some unique things to make sure that we mitigated some of the funds that weren't there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13321.987s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we did that by working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13324.128s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We didn't do that by the school committee and the council, not seeing eye to eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13327.129s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We did that by working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13328.982s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we were able to put out a product that was good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13331.383s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13333.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I miss all you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=13335.285s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And have a good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3108.97s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3109.911s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good evening, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3111.212s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3114.675s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it sort of seems like deja vu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3116.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3118.818s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3121.22s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3124.761s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3129.985s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3136.749s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3148.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: By laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3152.577s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3157.858s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, week after week we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3164.84s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3169.101s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the former councillor just referred to the salaries that city councillors are paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3175.202s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3179.979s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The collections this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3181.441s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3184.726s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a lot of money out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3186.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's over $9 million in certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3188.871s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This community is stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3190.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This community is thriving, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3194.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think it's about time that you take a hard vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3197.201s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3200.101s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You spend the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3201.022s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Give the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3207.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3213.244s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3218.606s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And some of those are outdated, correct, Chief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3221.134s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3222.215s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3231.183s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3242.408s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3254.016s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown, in Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers, and very easily that could have came north on Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3270.601s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Chief Gilbert, he could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning, and we could have had it going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3277.647s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women, and also to the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3283.652s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3287.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Go up the cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3288.833s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a thriving cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3290.394s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3297.356s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Councilor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3302.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that that's been on the plate up there, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3306.619s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3309.6s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think if you wait one week, I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3311.992s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3314.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And here's the other thing, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3316.555s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We heard the young lady over here and the commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3326.242s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There has been price quotations that have been sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3329.364s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3334.807s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3342.252s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3345.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and, and, and, um, and financing equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3351.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he was very, very good at his job, uh, doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3354.123s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, uh, here we are this evening and, uh, we're looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always preferred, the preferred method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3368.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: as far as the council was doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3370.732s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, I just want to say, uh, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3379.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, uh, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3383.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, it's great being down here this evening and thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=449.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: City.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3041.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3042.307s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good evening, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3043.608s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3047.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it sort of seems like deja vu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3049.951s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3053.612s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department, this is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3062.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3069.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3081.305s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: By laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks, I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3090.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, week after week, we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3097.188s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3101.449s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the former councilor just referred to the salaries that city councilors are paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3107.55s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3112.324s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The collections this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3113.806s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3117.071s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's a lot of money out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3118.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's over $9 million in certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3121.216s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This community is stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3122.939s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This community is thriving, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3126.702s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think it's about time that you take a hard vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3129.583s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3132.483s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You spend the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3133.404s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Give the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3139.505s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3145.646s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3151.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And some of those are outdated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3152.068s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct, Chief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3153.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3154.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3163.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3174.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3186.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3190.742s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3198.605s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And very easily that could have came north on Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3202.987s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Chief Gilberti could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning and we could have had it going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3210.05s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women and also to the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3216.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3220.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Go up the cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3221.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have a thriving cemetery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3222.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3229.779s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Councilor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3234.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that that's been on the plate up there, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3239.045s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3242.008s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think if you wait one week, I think it's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3247.412s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And here's the other thing, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3248.973s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We heard the young lady over here and the Commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3258.66s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There has been price quotations that have been sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3261.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3267.197s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said, let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3277.806s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and financing equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3283.571s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he was very, very good at his job doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3286.533s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But here we are this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3289.883s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3299.029s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: preferred, the preferred method, as far as the council was doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3303.151s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just want to say, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3312.276s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3315.558s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it's great being down here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3317.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3440.339s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2376.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2377.887s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Good evening, Mr. President, uh, members of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2380.47s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My name is Paul Camuso, a resident of one 14 Lincoln road in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2385.916s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you this evening on this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2391.102s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, as we all know, we've seen an increase in air traffic over our community and uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2397.033s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My personal opinions, being this close to Boston, we're going to see things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2402.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's what makes us one of the components of making a great community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2406.296s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's having the proximity to Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2409.377s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that comes the responsibility of our elected officials to advocate on behalf of our residents to make sure that we can do the best that we can as far as mitigating circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2421.821s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The interesting part of this conversation, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2424.978s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Currently, runway 15 right at Logan Airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2428.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're looking to, as the gentleman said, to possibly divert more of the traffic to 15 right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2435.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For those of you that don't realize it, 15 right is the landing path when it comes over like Winchester, right over the Lawrence Memorial Hospital in the Lawrence Estates, and then over the lower part of the Fulton Heights in Wellington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2450.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and that will certainly increase if, um, if the changes go through, uh, I'd be remissed if I don't thank, um, the mayor as well as the city council for, um, for making sure that we have a seat at the table next week, um, at these very important meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2467.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think the, uh, the FAA, uh, they're more worried about safety and things of that magnitude rather than noise complaints because at the end of the day, uh, safety is their paramount, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2479.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: uh, thoughts and feelings when it comes to, um, these type of decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2483.513s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I'm learning a lot more about the air traffic patterns and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2486.915s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My brother is a commercial pilot for a major airline that flies out of Logan airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2491.317s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um, and, uh, like he was explaining to me, certain winds and stuff dictate the runway takes off and takeoffs and landings, uh, as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2500.442s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's not just saying we're going to bury Medford with all the noise and give Milton a break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2504.624s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It all depends on some, uh, extenuating circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2507.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As someone that does like to fly to go on vacation, I would rather take the safest route out of the airport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2516.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: given the nature of being in an aircraft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2519.354s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, it's common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2521.175s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just wanted to get up here and thank the Mayor, Mayor Burke, as well as the City Council on this particular matter, because I think one of the best things that we have going for us is voices of reason sitting at the table and discussing topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2537.961s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The other thing I know that should be a priority of people is if we're going to get more air traffic over our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2545.28s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We should be entitled to more funding to put additional measures in people's homes, similar to Winthrop, similar to East Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2554.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I know that that's another important piece of the puzzle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2558.269s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just think it's very important that we look at this as a safety issue and as well as an issue of quality of life at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2568.776s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One should not trump the other, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2571.399s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but I'm just a one of many citizens in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2574.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this distinguished body this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2579.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I look forward to seeing how this goes along and the next coming months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2584.364s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3042.068s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Once again, Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, here in our lovely community of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3048.334s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3049.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just would like to get up and thank this city council, as well as Mayor Burke and the DPW, the safety improvements at the Brooks School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3057.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And as many of you are aware, my son is a second grader at the Brooks School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3066.903s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When you look at just those minor changes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3070.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It certainly changed the whole traffic patterns down there, not as far as cut-throughs and all that, but as far as people traversing Route 60, those lights are incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3080.85s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3081.39s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And to see them go up so quickly is a testament to our local government working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3087.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it was just, it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3088.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know there's more long-term<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3090.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: planning that's going on in that particular area through West Medford Square and the like, but in the immediate, the immediate changes have gone over very, very big with the parents and it's certainly given us a safer environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3105.253s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just wanted to get up and thank you all as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=63.115s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=64.516s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it is a pleasure to be here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=67.615s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, early on after the mayor was elected, she put together these teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=71.797s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And right off the bat, she was adamant that we make sure that we include all different areas of this community, as well as the different demographics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=81.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think that based upon the meetings that we had, the survey that was put out and completed by over 300 residents, as well as the public meetings, I think we accomplished that task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=96.088s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The report that the mayor is going to highlight I think is inclusive of many areas where the city as well as the different department heads can improve as well as a focus on making sure that we're here to have the needs of each and every constituent met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=113.251s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want to once again thank the mayor and look forward to working with her administration as we move this city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HPv_ePzvD5E&t=120.172s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's been an honor to serve with my fellow members here and once again thank you Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3109.569s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3125.96s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3127.06s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I don't even know where to begin, you know, uh, 36 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3133.763s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I was two years older than Councilor Lungo, you know, and, uh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3141.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3143.745s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: For the first time, I'm speechless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3145.026s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, Bob, you're really a fellow that's kept me young over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3149.908s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Sometimes you'd think that we were two kids getting ready to fight at Playstead Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3154.491s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But in reality, we were both just fighting for what we really believed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3159.454s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's something that I admire about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3163.816s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going out this evening, retiring as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3166.698s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the council's not going to be the same without you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3171.673s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I respect your loyalty, your tenacious ability to fight for what you believe in, and you've certainly been passionate over your tenure on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3182.719s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One thing that I really admired about you, and I was going through a similar situation at the time with my dad, was when you cared for your lovely wife, Linda, and I saw a side of you that most people didn't see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3199.109s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm just talking about my dad, I get a little emotional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3203.81s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you really are a good-hearted guy, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3206.151s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: At the end of the day, and the good part about it was, I'd see you at Bocelli's or something, after a meeting, you'd still tell me how much I stink, but we could laugh about it, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3218.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, like I said, I'm going out tonight, we're both going out as winners, we both won by fighting for the people of Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3230.759s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: didn't want to make it sound, I'm in good company of leaving this room tonight with another councillor that I know left his best battle on the field and you fought for what you believed in and for that you should be very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5064.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5065.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was a very nice send-off, nice speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5070.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I grew up in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5073.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As you all know, basically the only two mayors that I remember are Mayor Parikh and Mayor McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5081.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5083.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Still a little emotional, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5087.767s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: During my last 16 years as a member of the city council, you know, I had some of the best times of my life, but also some of the toughest times of my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5098.355s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, a few people upstairs right now looking down that I know are proud of me are my dad, that many of you knew, Al, and my grandmother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5110.263s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I remember the, uh, the parties, the election night parties at my grandmother's house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5116.467s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, we had some fun, you know, but, uh, you know, also in 2006, I married my best friend, Janine, you know, Janine, thank you for being there for me because as, um, as Susan knows, and the rest of the spouses of the, uh, Councilors, this is a full-time job, you know, and, uh, I, I, I had the, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5140.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the, the word I'm looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5145.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5147.269s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I saw that I was spending too much time actually doing this job and not enough time where it actually was important on occasion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5155.131s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5156.832s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because this job does take a toll upon you and more your loved ones than you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5162.914s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd be here fighting with my friend, and I'd be getting calls at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5167.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got good supporters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5168.056s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They'd call and yell at my poor wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5171.377s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you know the stuff that goes along with this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5175.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And for that, I'm forever grateful, honey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5178.301s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've been there through some of my biggest struggles in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5182.464s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you're the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5183.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I love you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5192.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Moving ahead a little bit, a couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5195.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Next best, well, they're equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5198.918s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Best thing in my life is that little guy sitting in row number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5202.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Little Jimmy, stand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5204.122s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Stand up, buddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5212.547s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Bob said, this is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5214.169s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5214.929s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm really looking forward to just getting grounded again and getting back into some sort of sense of normalcy of not being out on, it's not just Tuesday nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5226.687s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's many a nights and you know the constituent service part, we have people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5231.431s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm only as good as the people that have supported me and got me to where I needed to be at first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5235.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And a few people that I want to acknowledge from my family is my brother John and my brother Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5249.998s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I was very lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5251.218s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I got great in-laws and, and, uh, they do more babysitting for me to get out and to do the constituent stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5258.341s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, and, and, uh, you know, you're going to get a little more free time on your hands now too, Jeannie and Frank, cause I'll be home a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5264.864s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, so thank you for all that you've, uh, done for me and my family, um, over the years and also my brother-in-law Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5272.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, um, you know, my original committee, they're mostly here tonight when I decided to run for office in 1999.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5280.593s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I gathered the people that were just closest to me and near and dear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5285.314s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's my aunt, my campaign manager, Carol Regan, who's right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5289.616s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, auntie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5295.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Another person who's well known in this community from Medford Youth Hockey and just a real great person is Len Galeona, who's right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5308.747s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Also, someone that is on the DPW, I don't know if he's still here, but Mike Nesta, another original.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5315.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One of the original guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5319.023s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And also my pal, Jason, you know, right from the very beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5322.924s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: My buddy, Jason Traviglione, he was there right from the beginning with several of my other cousins, Tommy, Terry, Tony, Johnny, Joey, and Artie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5331.988s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, we hit the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5332.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'll tell you a funny story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5334.349s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You talk about walking the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5336.209s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll never forget it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5337.09s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was one of your neighbors on Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5339.351s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're passing out the first literature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5341.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Guy calls me over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5342.312s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I like the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5342.872s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It looks good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5343.652s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you spelt commitment wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5345.553s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5346.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got to be kidding me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5347.557s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So instead of passing out literature, we're running back up the hill trying to take the literature back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5352.7s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And of course, like any good politician, you tell a little fib.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5357.083s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I blame the printer, but it was really my fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5362.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A few City Hall department heads that have really been there for me over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5365.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's Roy Belson from the schools, Mark Rumley, who's in the room in the back there, as well as the past president of the Medford City Council, Bob Mayorko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5375.484s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the people that were just very helpful over the years in giving me guidance, and I want to thank them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5383.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, 16 years is a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5386.552s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I went back and just was plugging in the years on the computer, because I knew I had to speak tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5391.113s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It seems, uh, it was in 2000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5393.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's when, uh, the big race between Al Gore and George Bush, when we didn't know who the president was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5400.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That seems like many, many, many years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5402.963s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A few years later or the next year we had September 11th, you know, and, um, there was also the good things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5410.969s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I was an elected official, I was able to stand here and get my picture taken with the world series trophy, a Patriots trophy, and also a Bruins trophy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5419.336s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, that's, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5421.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That just tells you how long 16 years is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5423.807s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And 16 years is a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5425.289s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I couldn't do it, 38.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5426.99s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, sirree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5430.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, as far as the councillors, I mentioned Bob Mayorko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5432.895s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Other two councillors that I served with when I first got on, it was Councilor Bill Carr, who Bill was just another good guy, and Councilor Macarena, who I served with for a short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5443.024s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just want to thank them, because I know how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5447.37s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: how this is sometimes on your family life and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5450.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it doesn't go unnoticed, the sacrifice that all the councilors here have made over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5457.512s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Michael Marks, you know, when we first started out, Michael Marks and myself, we were close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5463.813s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We were in that first little block of four who made Stephanie Muccini-Burke the president of the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5470.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we drifted apart over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5472.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Michael, you're a stalwart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5474.116s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're a good kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5477.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got a good career ahead of you, and it's been a pleasure to serve with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5480.422s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he said he's going to be on that side, so you ain't getting home early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5487.826s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Ricky, what else can I say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5489.047s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As you said, you used to drive us to Austin Prep with Ricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5492.709s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We'd be driving up to Austin Prep in the morning, and like screwballs, we'd put our hand out the window when it was 30 degrees so we could keep the hand outside the window longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5500.294s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just stupid, stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5503.536s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you'd be yelling at us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5506.009s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm freezing in here, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5508.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But you're just a great, great guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5510.572s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And your wife, Carol, who certainly is also a big champion behind you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5517.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Fred Dello Russo, when I first ran, I didn't know if I was running for the Medford City Council or running against Fred Dello Russo, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5523.952s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Everybody in this city made it a Camuso-Dello Russo race when Freddy first ran for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5529.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sure some of you remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5531.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so as Fred stated, it was a rocky start, but you know something, Fred?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5537.022s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Me and you became best pals here, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5541.244s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This guy right here, he's there for people in their time of need, but he's also been there for me, uh, as a fellow city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5547.988s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, and on occasion when I get ramped up, he'd tell me, Hey, calm down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5553.851s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'd listen to him sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5555.442s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Other times there was no stopping the kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5558.243s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Fred, you know, I really value our friendship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5561.524s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know we're going to be lifelong friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5563.565s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And your dad also was there for me when I first ran for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5567.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just you come from an outstanding family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5569.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you for being my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5574.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Adam, thank God for that English test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5579.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, Adam, uh, Adam and I have been friends for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5583.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, Adam was there for me early on in my campaigns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5586.377s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, I just wish I had more time to serve with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5589.118s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, um, as I stated a little earlier, I just, uh, I'm looking forward to a little time off and, um, and having a nine to five, uh, day rather than, um, I will stay up, watch about half the city council meetings, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5602.143s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But, uh, but, uh, Adam, you're, you're just a great person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5606.196s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn, you know, went to Medford High School with Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5612.58s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just, you're just a good kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5615.863s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You also fight, I call them kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5617.544s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm only a year older than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5619.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're just a great person, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5621.506s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I've watched you over the years become a good councilor, but also a mom of three children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5629.8s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I find it tough with one child being a councillor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5632.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you really are just, you're a stalwart, and you get out, and you really work hard, and I want to thank you for your friendship over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5642.971s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Bob, I've already said it, you're a good guy, and I'm going to miss our fights, because to be honest with you, I'm going to be honest with you, and if he wasn't there and I wasn't there, the meetings would be boring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5657.043s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Fair to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5665.275s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, a few other people that I'd just like to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5669.23s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to congratulate and thank is right over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5672.351s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These two young fellas over here, George Scarpelli and John Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5676.933s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that Bob and I leave this evening, and we're leaving it in good hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5681.495s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: These are two guys that are coming from the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5683.636s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They understand the complexity of issues, and it's not always a quick, easy fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5687.958s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Councilor Dello Russo stated a little earlier, the legislative process sometimes moves a little bit slower than people would like, but at the end of the day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5699.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This city's in good hands with the people coming on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5703.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Being that person that just drives the DPW crazy over the years, I saved the best for last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5710.373s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The DPW, people don't realize the work that they do on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5715.874s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're not only dealing with the stuff when they get in in the morning that they have the long list of stuff, but they're dealing with seven city councillors calling them, they're dealing with residents calling them, they're dealing with the mayor's office calling them, they're dealing with just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5726.818s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They stop to get a cup of coffee and people are yelling and screaming, and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5731.044s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, people don't realize that the snow plowing, they think that after the DPW plows the snow away from their driveway, that they just come by to get a chuckle and put it back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5740.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5741.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5743.881s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a job that you do very, very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5747.943s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Steve Tanagli is in the back of the room, and he works as well with Mike Nestor and Paul Gere, who's our current commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5755.206s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you guys for meeting my individual needs, because I have always taken this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5761.769s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, the big issues are going to be debated here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5764.21s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the one by one is how you build friendships, relationships, and how you build bonds that you'll have forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5773.274s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor mocks Carol Bailey who was one of my closest friends over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5777.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I met her her son is in college now He's ready to graduate and I met her when Michael mocks called me because she had one of those funky streets in West Medford Hercroft Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5786.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was the year Michael left the school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5789.512s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Half of the street went to the Gleason School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5791.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you live right next door, you went to the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5795.116s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And through Councilor Marks, I was able to build a bond by helping out Carol and her son remain at the Gleason School or get into the Gleason School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5803.001s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And one by one, that's how you build a good group, a good following behind you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5809.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just can't say enough about the DPW because they're great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5815.79s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we can get a hand for those guys because they really are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5826.344s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The last two people I just want to acknowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5831.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I've got the wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5834.647s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You'll laugh, I've got to make sure, because I'll never hear the end of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5839.629s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The last two people I'd like to acknowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5841.69s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's one other person that's retiring at the end of this year with Councilor Bob and myself, and that's Mayor Mike McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5849.213s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People seem to think that I've just got this rosy, great relationship with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5853.615s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People don't realize how much we battle behind the closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5856.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, you know, and even Councilor Pente, I think you'd say the same about Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5862.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you can battle and battle, but he always tried to do what's right for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5867.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's been a great mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5868.776s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5869.297s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If he wasn't doing something right, he wouldn't be the mayor overwhelmingly for 28 consecutive years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5874.638s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So when you keep that into perspective, the man is retiring, the man's going to spend more time with his family, but I personally want to thank him for his years of service and the invaluable things he taught me over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5889.061s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So Mike McGlynn, good luck in your retirement as well if you're out there watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5892.662s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, it's sort of like some of those old TV shows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5895.104s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No one watches, but everyone knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5897.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He still says he never watches it, but I think he's full of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5899.828s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think he watches the council meetings, and he just says that, oh, I heard of this or that, but I think he's watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5905.633s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if you are watching, Mr. Mayor, you've done a hell of a job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5908.315s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's been a good ride, and best of luck to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5918.041s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The next individual and in the last individual that I just want to recognize this evening, you know There was a race for mayor in this community the first time in 28 years and that's a long time 28 years it was former mayor Parika And then it was mayor Mike McGlynn for 28 years and in the new mayor-elect, you know as I stated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5942.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mayor-elect Burke has been a former member of this Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5947.185s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you know, I hope that I'm saying this, but you know, people say, well, when she went to the mayor's office, she didn't do this or wasn't responsive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5958.287s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5959.187s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: People got to understand, she worked for another individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5962.468s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She worked for another individual that called all the shots in that office, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5966.965s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I really think that this city is in good hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5970.248s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Councilor Penta said, there wasn't a mandate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5972.71s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was a very close election, but the people have spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5975.553s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think this is the time that we all have to get behind the new administration and work to make Medford a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5981.258s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5982.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She's in a position now where she can make things happen and not being the director of budget and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5987.883s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, um, and for that, and last but not least, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5991.222s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: During this campaign, I was able to spend a lot of time with her and her family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5995.526s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just got to see a side of them that I necessarily didn't over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5999.869s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And other than my dad, my dad always loved her as a Councilor because she was sharp and she didn't speak all the time on every issue, but she knew the vote she was taking and was very smart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6011.579s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I relied upon my dad's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6018.158s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: thoughts over the years, and Stephanie Burke, you're gonna be a hell of a mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6023.604s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know you got big shoes to fill, but you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6026.487s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You surround yourself with good people, be open-minded, and just always doing the right thing, and this community's going to prosper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6034.735s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And for anyone out there that may think differently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6038.078s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Give her a shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6038.959s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's always two years from now, you can take a look or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6041.983s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I have the utmost faith in knowing her brains, her intelligence, and her compassion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6048.05s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because in this job as mayor, you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6051.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And this is very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6052.245s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I admire the both candidates for mayor, because early on in the race, there were some things that made me ponder and say, I'm glad I didn't run for mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6060.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that was when you had to make major personnel decisions based upon actions of people that may have did something within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6067.34s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The mayor's office is a job that you're actually the CEO of a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6072.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're saying people may not have a job tomorrow based upon some of their actions or based upon circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6080.888s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so you need to be, you need to have a lot of different characteristics for that job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6087.112s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But Stephanie, I look forward to, and the mayor-elect is here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6091.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you could please just take a bow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6103.789s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just want to thank everyone for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6109.392s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know she texted me 30 times before, because I had to go get flowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6113.634s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I'd like my son and my wife to come up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6116.135s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I got little flowers for you, Whole Foods, but Dorico McGlynn was closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6165.471s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6166.412s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Hey, go ahead, ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6167.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What did you just ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6168.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I want you to know what I got him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6174.038s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, two more days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6174.838s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Santa's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6175.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But on an all serious note, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6178.621s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This has been a hell of a ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6180.262s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I just want to thank everyone for coming here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6184.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for me just because this is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6187.256s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, you look around this room and there's 150 years worth of family and everything else, right James?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6194.523s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So God bless everyone and Merry Christmas and good luck to the new city council, the new school committee and the new mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6201.51s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Let's move this city in the right direction and I'll be on the sidelines watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6233.93s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6236.112s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: After I got here and I put the people that helped me get here, it's the citizens of Medford, it's the citizens of Medford that I owe a big thank you to because without them, none of this would have been possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6247.361s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So thank you Medford and good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8924.069s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8925.57s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We say there was a flood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8927.031s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If so, what teachers were not reimbursed and where was this flood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8931.554s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In a flood at the Roberts and a flood at the McGlynn over the last two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8934.836s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8935.276s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do the teachers have not been reimbursed for their own personal money putting out there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8940.878s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, we should want to look into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8943.319s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can the council at least give us the names after so we can get the superintendent to look at this as soon as possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8950.083s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You don't want to say it on the floor, though, because obviously you don't want to throw the teachers out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8955.226s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: How many teachers in total on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8960.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when was this flood recently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8969.392s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The better question, too, is, I think, how is the building flooding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8973.394s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Pipes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8973.874s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think the pipes are breaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8975.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, if we could get the teachers' names and find out where the reimbursement is and for what type of things they're looking to get reimbursed on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8982.999s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because obviously, if they're coming out of pocket for this stuff as a result of a maintenance issue, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9440.44s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd just like to explain my next vote before it's called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9443.563s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to support the amendment on the discretionary funding, but on the main motion, I believe that's a school committee issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9450.13s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The money was appropriated as an aggregate amount for the Medford school committee to spend under their wise, um, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9458.643s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: vote or not so wise vote, whatever it was, but it was a budget that was passed in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9462.966s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, I'm going to leave this as a school committee may issue similar to what the young lady stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9468.309s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I will be voting no on that, but the discretionary funding I'm going to vote yes on because that's a funding that we have not seen at any point where the mayor it's mitigation or from his golf tournament or it's from some other funding source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9682.884s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Another great successful Medford High School graduate story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9686.126s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could send him a letter of congratulations on behalf of this honorable body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10020.918s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10021.118s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10022.019s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This will probably be my last speech at the city council, but who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10027.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10028.203s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We get a few minutes left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10030.585s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Certainly this is a good one to end on as a method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10032.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: City council, Dom Camara is just a gentleman and um, served the citizens of Medford as a school teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10040.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with dignity over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10042.477s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And rather than retire, he took on another role post-retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10047.6s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I want to wish him well and thank him for his years of service as a commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10052.323s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As Councilor Mark stated, it's a job that you go into the meeting and you get yelled at and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10057.907s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's a thankless job, but a lot of work went into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1530.383s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1532.864s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Comcast Open Voice, that was actually—it wasn't public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1536.844s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was more a website initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1540.435s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that Comcast did, so we were one of either four or five, like Councilor Marks indicated, cities throughout the nation that did receive that grant or funding for it, but it was more towards webpage development and have the interaction through the web, not on public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1557.744s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I certainly think that the new administration going forward is going to, if anyone's going to get it up and running, it's going to be the new administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1566.503s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to come in here, I'm assuming, and they're going to want to get things done in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1571.164s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And public access hasn't been on the air for quite some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1575.766s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This city council is well on record on trying to shut down public access over the years with the TV3 gang by a myriad of votes that took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1587.249s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I certainly am in support of Councilor Penta's motion to get a public access station up and running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1595.632s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And quite honestly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1596.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was a few months ago that I joked with Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1600.129s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I plan on having you on my cooking show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1602.45s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And you actually said you'd come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1604.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I'm going to have a show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1606.232s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When it's up and running, it's going to be a cooking show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1608.192s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I'm going to have you on, and the two of us are going to break bread together, and we're going to make a nice Italian dish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3057.689s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3059.07s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just, I'd be remissed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3060.57s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're talking about public access and the holiday season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3063.531s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, um, I just want to thank the individual out there that sent a real nice, um, obscene Christmas card to the Camuso family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3072.855s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's someone that, uh, I believe based upon the investigation that's ongoing in handwriting that's been submitted to the Medford city council on petitions over the years that law enforcement, um, utilizing the federal mail service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3085.599s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, I think there's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3089.27s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm sure everyone will hear about it in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3091.511s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to that person that sent a card with threats in it, as well as swears, and when my six-year-old opened it up that's just learning how to read, I would just like to thank that individual, because when you screw around with the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3107.321s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: mail, it's not something that people take lightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3111.844s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So to that person, I just want to wish them a very happy holiday season, and I'm sure we'll be seeing them very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3117.845s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in the proper place, so Merry Christmas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4216.232s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4217.312s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd just like to send our very sorrowful condolences to the family of Joan Sacco-Sullivan, who passed away this morning after a short<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4227.235s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but a very aggressive battle with pancreatic cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4231.257s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the pleasure of knowing Mrs. Sullivan since I was a little boy, growing up with her son, Greg, in West Medford, and just a real good family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4239.14s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: She's got wonderful children, and she'll be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4243.402s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, she was a school secretary for probably over 35 years, still assigned to the Columbus School up until the time she got sick, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4255.425s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: just want to send her family our condolences and Thank them for her years of service to the children of this community in her 30 plus years with the method public schools Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4283.722s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4292.187s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4293.748s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to just say thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4296.429s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm not going to put in an official resolve, but a thank you to Teamsters Local 25 and President Sean O'Brien and Vice President Stephen Self.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4305.435s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just this last week, a Medford family that is less fortunate received an entire van full of toys<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4313.705s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: by the Teamsters Local 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4315.687s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could just send them a thanks, it's one of the many charitable events that they run each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4320.87s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could send that to them on behalf of the Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2783.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They also have to be subdivided within a condo association which has to be recorded prior to doing anything in the building department because there's so many standards as far as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2794.186s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: water meters and everything else, common areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2800.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Knight had a paper around a month ago to address this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2892.689s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2895.03s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mortgage companies are not going to give you a mortgage either, unless it's a deeded property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3029.239s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Move the question and the floor passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3639.98s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thanks, Ian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5125.525s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That certainly is the will of the mayor if he has the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5129.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is asking for a vote to ask him to bring the million dollars according to municipal finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5136.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's the only way that a money paper can be initiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5139.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's with the official mayor bringing it forward to the legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5144.679s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So let's just take the vote on hers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5146.52s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whatever, if it fails, if it passes, and we move forward on the rest of the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5149.983s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5152.284s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5201.809s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Move to four questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5587.856s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're still talking about that million dollars that the council took a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5600.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Half of what Councilor Lungo proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5601.858s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You double it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5602.719s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well, a little bit more, 2.4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5603.499s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is all semantics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5607.459s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We just took a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6020.725s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion to vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8102.37s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8104.011s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Unfortunately, this has been a nice meeting, I thought, and I still do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8111.172s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I'm not going to sit here and just let the Medford resident be bashed, to be quite frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8117.653s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're all entitled to our opinion, as Councilor Penta said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8120.754s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A campaign took place for several offices in the community, and nobody knows what happened in this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8126.755s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8128.075s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But what happened last week during a congratulatory citation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8135.961s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When family members, young kids that happen to maybe be watching this, it was classless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8142.186s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It was absolutely classless, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8144.968s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I understand the frustrations possibly, but this is right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8149.231s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When the same counsellor talked about a freshman captain on the girls hockey team and berated her and said that she, the girls didn't even want her to be captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8159.539s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the mother came storming down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8163.248s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's classless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8164.63s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's classless, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8166.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We don't know what happened in that particular matter, nor will anyone that was other than the people that were in that room may not know what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8172.899s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I agree with the Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8174.801s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We can all put any resolutions on and this and that and thank people, but last week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8180.592s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: when it was a resolution of just to say congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8183.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's resolutions that every single member of this council have put on over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8188.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe it was congratulating someone that was convicted of a crime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8191.677s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe it was other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8193.558s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And there's been instances where maybe people have been uneasy about supporting a congratulatory resolution or something along those lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8202.461s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the fact of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8204.412s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It just wasn't the appropriate time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8206.213s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If the gentleman has a problem with anyone, maybe pick up the phone and call him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8210.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just wish it didn't get to this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8212.536s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I was hoping that last week was the end of it, but I just can't sit here and... And here's the other piece of it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8222.681s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It is a big, the particular promotion that this gentleman received is a very, very, very big promotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8230.785s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The vice president<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8232.29s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: of the Teamsters, who the President is Sean O'Brien, that we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8236.392s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there's over 500 members of the Teamsters Local 25 right here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8241.934s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the City Hall employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8243.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the secretaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8244.595s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not the DPW only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8246.935s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You got many, many, many, many, many Teamsters that live in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8250.597s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And like I said, Mr. President, this is America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8254.118s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Penter is certainly entitled to his opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8256.792s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just think last week wasn't the time nor the place during a congratulations for a gentleman that, like I said, we don't know really what happened in the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8268.179s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's two sides to every story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8270.1s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I just couldn't sit here and I just wish that this didn't come up another week because it's unfortunate that this took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8282.996s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's all I got to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8284.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, I just, uh, uh, other than that, I'm really, I'm really just speechless that, uh, that during a congratulations, this would come up, but consular pent is certainly entitled to his right to say anything he wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8295.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And he's got to stick by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8297.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: He's got to stick by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8298.384s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If he, uh, if he's asked questions on it or what happened or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8302.006s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, uh, there's really nothing else I can say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8768.272s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8768.773s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe the matter was reported to the school committee last evening, late in the meeting, but they actually negotiated a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8777.751s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with the cafeteria workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8779.032s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So Councilor Penta is, in fact, not correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8908.65s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8910.571s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So before we receive this and place it on file, I'd just like to say once again that the councilor was not correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8917.494s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9267.413s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9268.594s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, first of all, um, just a couple of minor corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9272.357s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The school department has not ran on a deficit the last, I would say, at least five years, as long as I can remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9277.339s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have Louise Miller here who can verify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9279.86s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The councillor stated that a million dollars overrun last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9283.242s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We haven't bailed them out, I would say, since 2004 or 2005.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9288.264s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's probably the last time that they had to be bailed out, and it was during tough economic times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9293.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The second thing is, this was done actually in open session, because I saw the same point where the cafeteria workers were discussed, so that was not true as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9302.361s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The last thing is, I think the sketchy part of this whole thing is someone's talking about negotiation and legal matters out of executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9311.605s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, that should be investigated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9313.185s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Obviously, the councillor has her ear to the ground and someone is reporting to her about executive session stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9318.347s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Until that is approved at the next regularly scheduled meeting, the minutes and stuff, it's not something I think, I mean, that's the sketchy part of this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9326.13s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So maybe we could ask the superintendent of schools to maybe look into that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9330.677s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I'm being facetious on that, but obviously there's a purpose for executive session, and that's for negotiation and legal matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9342.367s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's to discuss the pay raises, negotiation, legal matters, whether the teachers, the custodians, the secretaries get a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9354.216s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So like I said, obviously there was a lot discussed last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9359.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: in negotiation and legal matters, as it appeared to be after the fact when it was back in open session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9367.38s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just wanted to point those few things out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9369.261s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The biggest thing was, though, that the school department has not been a million dollars in deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9374.044s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm glad to see the two new Councilors over there shaking their head, because they know the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9379.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They've been around for quite some time, and that has not been overrun in at least, at least, I would say, six or seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9385.971s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't want to go any further, because I know there was a rough patch where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9389.524s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We did have to bail them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9390.385s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe it was before Louise Milleville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9392.627s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Louise, you've been here how many years now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9394.99s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Four years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9396.031s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, but I think that those few factual things I just wanted to point out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9401.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Here's the other thing, last but not least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9402.998s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know much about the position, but a lot of people have been talking about we have to make the Medford Public Schools more attractable to people and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9413.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if this is a public relations, it's going to get people back from charter schools, get people back from maybe Minuteman, from other schools that we're actually doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9421.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, this position could pay for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9424.039s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like I said, as I have in all matters, since I've been on this city council, I do believe the school department and the school committee are tasked by the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9436.322s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if it's something that they're saying they need, then I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9561.876s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9563.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would just hope that this doesn't have to do with other unions and union leadership that may be bucking up at the school system, whether the secretary's union wants this in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9573.906s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: association or other unions, because that certainly could be a person of the general... I want to use my wording correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9587.854s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A person of the general mind could think that this is the union issue, similar to the Teamsters that we just talked about a few minutes ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9596.619s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, I just want to say if the school committee and the school department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9601.957s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's needed, and I support them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9603.718s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They were elected by the citizens of Medford, as were we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=9609.203s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10356.269s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10357.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would be remissed if I didn't say a few words about this gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10362.014s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, when I came on the school committee scene back in 1999, I didn't really know Mr. Fresa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10369.74s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But when I met him, he was one of those guys that you pick up the phone, you make sure you go see, like Paul Kavanaugh, Honorable Justice Adam Alden, and just a real, real nice guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10382.35s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I had the opportunity of getting close with Mr. Fresa<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10385.317s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: through my wife's uncle, Bob Mayorko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10388.659s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And so for the past 10 or 12 years, serving with Uncle Bob here on the city council, I got pretty close with Mr. Frazer to the point where I'd have coffee on Sunday nights once in a while with him and Justice Kavanaugh down at Brigham's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10404.589s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And just a real good guy, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10407.471s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But when I got the call this morning, it's one of those things that you just didn't want to believe, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10412.84s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: because just this past weekend he was out and about, stopping shop, doing his shopping with former President Mayocko and just a really good guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10424.023s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd also like to acknowledge, you know, Bob Mayocko was very, very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10431.278s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: to Mr. Frazer, especially after he couldn't drive anymore and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10435.019s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a real gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10436.079s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, you didn't see Al if you didn't see Paul Kavanaugh or Bob Mayorko on his arm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10442.381s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for that, I'm sure that the Frazer family is very appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10447.263s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Where Al's family, a lot of them were out of town, but he certainly had his Medford family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10453.925s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I know I'll miss him over at Bob and Cheryl's house on some of the holidays and things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10459.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So may he rest in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1072.132s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1072.673s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you guys for coming down this evening, Mr. Daley, with your whole entourage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1078.617s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just a quick couple of questions on the bus stop relocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1081.799s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It appears that the bus stop, the three options are going across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1085.442s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1120.436s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But the bus stop itself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1122.103s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Those red dots that you have are actually across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1140.593s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can you explain to people like myself that can't read construction maps, because it's very technical,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1148.039s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whereabouts are the three options so the viewing public will know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1151.462s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Basically, in layman's terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1158.947s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the middle of the overpass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1160.588s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Underneath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1162.61s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Lighting will be approved and everything else if that happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1165.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I have not looked into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1168.893s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's docked there until you guys started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1171.715s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now you have trucks under there with the lights at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1173.496s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's, yeah, that's a, but you can't count that as a construction is not on for a day then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1179.299s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1179.58s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So that's the first location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1180.94s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1192.247s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if you come from the restaurant and take a right, I'm assuming it's either on the left side of the street or on the right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1199.2s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All three proposed stops are on the same side of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1201.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1202.621s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you're in front of the restaurant, you come up to the westbound on-ramp to Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1206.722s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1207.342s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You take a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1208.863s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Now you're facing West Medford, down Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1211.964s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is it on your left or on your right compared to the restaurant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1214.944s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you were standing at the very beginning of the ramp, it would be immediately to your left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1219.246s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To your left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1219.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you'll actually have to cross the on-ramp to Route 16 eastbound to get to the bus stop from the existing location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1244.757s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you're gonna have to walk by the work zone to get to the bus stops underneath the ramp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1248.699s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you go there, you're just very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1251.32s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Forget about the construction maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1252.6s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm having a hard time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1262.745s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So where's the restaurant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1265.426s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The restaurant's not in the picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1266.546s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'll get both points out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1267.407s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because I think we're all a little puzzled by looking at that map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1301.007s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is the westbound on-ramp,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1303.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So you'd cross the street and the crosswalk, and it would be right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1307.621s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You walk a little bit further on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1326.017s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's probably 50 feet from the existing bus stop, maybe a little more, 75?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1329.5s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A little more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1332.045s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Could you walk over the bridge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1341.711s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's what I thought, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1342.711s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's about 500 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1343.672s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 500 feet, that's a lot for a senior citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1347.734s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're open to any suggestions, we'll put it wherever you want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1350.476s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Well the problem is, we didn't even know it was an option at this point because the communication inside of this building<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1357.228s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is certainly, there's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1359.87s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: November 18th, and trust me, I know how the MBTA and DOT work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1364.534s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You guys are very good at notifying the community on what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1368.697s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So there's something else going on once it hits the network within City Hall, shall we say, the internal memos within City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1376.644s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is the first we're hearing about the three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1379.967s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I can understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1381.568s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're probably coming up with a game plan which is the best, according to the professionals, the chief of police,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1386.915s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OCD, DPW, and then bringing it to the council for final approval, where we're the approving authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1393.017s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But like you said, we were under the impression the bus stop was going to stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1397.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But that leads to my second question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1400.718s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: A work zone right in front of the restaurant, that's a bigger concern as far as the restaurant, the insurance company, the real estate agent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1411.695s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What do you, when you define original?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1426.219s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if someone parks on, for lack of a better word, the old ring road or whatever, what do you call it now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1432.4s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Clipper, Clipper ship drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1436.382s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think that's what it's, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1439.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So for lack of a better word, if you park on Clipper ship drive, you're still going to get access to the restaurant, the insurance company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1445.528s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You could still walk across the street and get on the sidewalk and then get in the restaurant, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1449.549s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1450.349s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1450.709s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1451.19s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1451.47s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When you said work zone, I was just a little, uh, well, yeah, we, we can't have vehicles there though because so basically the barriers are just going to basically divert the road out towards because all the traffic coming towards Medford square from South Medford now is going to go over the new bridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1467.472s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And the traffic coming from Salem Street is now going to be diverted out, away from the restaurant, down to South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1476.659s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1477.639s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And when you say work zone, it's nothing more than a diversion of 20 feet out, 30 feet out, 40 feet out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1483.764s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: OK, I feel a lot comfortable now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1487.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: When you said a work zone, I was figuring fences up, and those guys couldn't get to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1491.89s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know Mr. Veneziano wouldn't be happy about that particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1497.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: With that being said, I just, I want to thank Mr. Daly and his staff too, because, uh, they, they, they obviously have been doing this communications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1504.938s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The breakdown has been from within the walls of this very building that we sit in this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1510.724s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, um, so if you could just keep notifying and, and, um, and I like councilor Dello Russo's idea, the green line,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1520.452s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, they've been keeping us abreast of the progress of that, probably weekly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1525.655s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Between the DOT and the Mass Gaming Commission, I've never met two agencies that notify more on a consistent basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1534.922s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's something, as far as transparency, I'm very happy about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1539.805s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The only thing the Green Line hasn't shared with us is their finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1543.527s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1545.369s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And hopefully, on a lighter note,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1547.829s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe that's going to be in about a month or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1549.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're going to come out with the actual report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1552.253s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Is that fairly correct on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1554.534s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I read that in today's Globe, but you can't take the Globe and everything else for 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1561.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But with that being said, if you could just please keep the notifications coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1564.723s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to reach out to Mr. Daley tomorrow, give you some additional email addresses to get on the external communique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1573.67s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1574.21s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And one other person that has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1576.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, pretty good with this and put me in touch with different, um, agencies regarding the DCR and some of the other stuff going on there has been representative Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1584.898s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, um, I know early on in this project back in June and July, there was a concern about the, um, environmental and the river and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1592.92s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, uh, rep Donato, uh, put, uh, put the constituents from South street in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1599.001s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, um, that, uh, that's always a good avenue of communications on, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1605.376s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: for those people, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2539.198s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes, Mr. Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2540.271s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to take 15-432 off the table and receive it and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2546.333s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The MassDOT was here this evening and that was for them to appear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3355.071s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3355.691s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, and I was going to basically make that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3357.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They actually met before the city council met last week and the paper before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3363.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is to move it from the account he's asking on the other part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3366.913s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the proper thing, I think, as one voting member of the council, is to move the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3373.157s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I think we made it loud and clear at previous meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3376.859s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We wanted it to come out of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3378.56s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But obviously, based upon the data before us, they took that vote last week prior to our committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3385.885s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So on this particular paper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3389.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm going to not withdraw my motion for approval, because in the sense, in essence, what Councilor Penta is asking to do is take more money out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3397.427s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So we have to take this to get to this point now anyway, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6159.396s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's obviously some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6162.037s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Why don't we send this to the committee of the whole where we can have the department heads there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6166.52s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Cause it's, I just, there's some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6169.122s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I would make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6170.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would draw a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6172.504s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Motion to send it to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6174.385s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Lococo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6450.375s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This one here, uh, the city is pursuing litigation for the money that they feel is owed to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6456.138s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, we have to pay this and move approval at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6591.446s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Contradictory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7201.83s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7203.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7204.832s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: This is just a friendly reminder for anyone over 65 years of age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7209.575s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we're the only state that has a law that exempts senior citizens from having to pay for a fee to use<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7222.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, if senior citizens see a fee on their bill for 411 directory assistance calls, it's usually $2.49.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7228.877s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If you see that, give a call to Comcast at 855-270-0379.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7232.299s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Could you repeat that, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7233.58s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 1-855-270-0379.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7234.021s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Verizon is 1-800-974-4111.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7250.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 6-0-0-6, and you can get the forms, fill them out, and you can be exempted that fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7257.794s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I know it's not a lot of money, but $2.50 a month for an entire year, it's certainly something for a senior citizen that's on a fixed income, and just want to spread the word on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7269.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'd like to see more people take advantage of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7683.105s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7684.386s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I would be remiss if I didn't congratulate the gentleman on his appointment as vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7690.212s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And sometimes people forget a community like Medford has over 500 members of the local 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7696.739s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We disposed of the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=760.765s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=766.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and I definitely support this this evening and I want to applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=772.772s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You know, all too often everyone sits behind this rail and in other elected positions throughout the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=779.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We say we're father veterans and we stand proudly with the veterans on Veterans Day and on Memorial Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=785.12s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We honor the sacrifice that many have made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=788.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But this is a real tangible piece of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=790.516s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: legislation that this council can stand behind boldly and send the message loud and clear that we're walking the walk, not just talking the talk when it comes to supporting the veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=800.243s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So on behalf of the local veterans, I'd like to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up and I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1455.16s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1457.282s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1458.664s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1460.586s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If she doesn't mind, I'd like to make a B paper that is in line with the fire department, but the new pieces of apparatus that were just purchased over the last 12 months, the rear step on the truck, unless you wear a size 4.5 shoe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1475.787s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: you can't safely do your job when you have to pull hose and stuff off of the back of the truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1480.669s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's about a thousand dollar part, I'm being told, I have not confirmed that, to extend the bumper so that a fire department personnel can safely stand on the rear step of these trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1493.053s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could ask the fire chief to look into it and to get this fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1499.035s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In the interest of public safety,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1500.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: because, uh, this, this is certainly an issue I saw it firsthand down at engine two and, uh, someone's going to get injured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1508.058s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1508.678s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We'll do that as an amendment if it's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2794.265s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Uh, nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2794.826s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just have one another thing on the suspension and when he's done with his very good, uh, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3083.914s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3087.958s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3089.139s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: While we're under suspension, we have a taxpayer and my friend, Mr. Jack Coakley, that would like to address this honorable body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3699.341s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3700.201s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3702.002s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3704.082s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And, Jack, I certainly understand your frustration, as I indicated on the telephone earlier today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3709.765s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I believe there's a timeline that National Grid is supposed to stop digging unless it's for emergency situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3716.422s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I thought it was around November 1st or October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3722.166s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could find out, first of all, who this gentleman George is, and secondly, once we do find out if a permit was issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3730.19s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I don't want to sit here and say we should put the whole project on hold, because I don't know if there's people on that street that are waiting for gas, for if there's leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3739.876s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I don't know the circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3741.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But to not notify the neighborhood well in advance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3744.735s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: well in advance and come up with some sort of a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3748.098s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, it's, it's mind boggling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3786.0s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm coming over your house for the winter then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3788.502s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3788.922s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could find out at least like, like you say, the city of Medford has control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3792.755s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: the permitting and as far as giving them the permission to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3797.739s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If we could find out the circumstances surrounding it and we can get back to Jack tomorrow because he needs to let his neighbors know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3805.204s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know there's other people in the neighborhood that are concerned about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3808.726s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: There's some senior citizens that live on Dwyer and in Gordley that depend on the sidewalks and the infrastructure in that immediate area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3818.613s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So I just, I wish there was more communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3821.634s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And it wasn't at four o'clock this afternoon, or earlier in the afternoon when Mrs. Coakley brought it to his attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3828.199s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if we could just get the answers and find out too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3831.981s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: From the engineering office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3833.522s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: From the engineering office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3834.343s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if this is some upgrade for the purpose of convenience, and it's not an emergency, and it's convenience, that we do put it off until the springtime when the nice weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3847.292s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Because the snow plows are going to be right behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3849.073s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They're already talking about snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3850.696s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and it's just going to create a problem after a problem after a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3854.74s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They said gas leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3855.901s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if it is gas leaks, that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3857.743s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, if it's gas leaks, it's gas leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3859.505s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We see the stories of houses blowing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3861.146s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You have to take care of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3862.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You can't put the fire department or the neighborhood people in danger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3865.831s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But if it's not gas leaks, and it is just because they have 13 customers that want to sign up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3871.712s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and start selling gas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3875.114s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah, and that was my second point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3876.615s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And Jack had a very good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3879.457s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You got Barry Park down the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3881.618s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3883.159s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You have the new, I call it the new Dame Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3886.382s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The Walnut Hill Properties owns a property there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3890.444s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If maybe they would give us a couple spots, do something to alleviate the neighborhood's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3896.948s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And last but not least, last but not least,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3901.405s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You've got to think that between November and Christmas is not a good time to be ripping up a street that's going to last 30 days, other than an emergency situation with gas leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3913.15s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But they knew about it two months before this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3915.231s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3927.417s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3929.097s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As you know, I talk to you quite frequently and I will, uh, be updating with you tomorrow with what we can find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6768.77s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I move suspension of the rules to clear up some of the old business on the council agenda that's been lingering since 2014 in some cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6882.946s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We're waiting to get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6883.626s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's just sitting on the agenda now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6884.846s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We got the report We got a report back on that didn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6926.184s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, but the solicitor has kept us updated along the whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6929.485s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All right, let him respond again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7098.426s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That was the money to cut the budget and then take it out of the other account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7107.25s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The budget passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7127.223s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's the same as 14 five 68 from the city solicitor update on the TV three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7190.395s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: 15-561.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7191.636s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7193.076s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7193.857s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7195.017s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Without prejudice, in case that gentleman comes back,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7212.279s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I'm just saying that, so if the gentleman does want to come back and appear, it's within the 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7216.862s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's right around the 90 days, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7219.684s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7220.364s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8079.041s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8081.328s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And I certainly agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn's frustrations and the business owners that should have close to up to the minute what's going on with the project, especially when it affects their businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8094.701s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But I don't want to send out the wrong message that if the City Council votes for a cease and desist,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8099.902s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: that the trucks are going to pack up, they're going to leave, and there'll be no work that gets done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8103.544s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: That's just inaccurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8104.865s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's irresponsible for us to let people think that we have the power to do that, because we do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8111.728s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Furthermore, if we do delay it, if we had the authority for a cease and desist, it's only going to add additional days on the end of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8120.072s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it'll be two years and three days if we did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8123.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as I stated, I think they have to work on their communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8129.18s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The particular department that is overseeing this project, which is a state project, if not the City of Medford, the Mass Department of Transportation, as the President indicated, between them and the Gaming Commission, I'm getting emails twice a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8146.359s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: with updates on the projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8148.26s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And given that that's the same entity, MassDOT, I don't see why we can't get the same, and interested people like the restaurants, like the banks, like the auto schools and everyone else in the particular area can sign up for those alerts as well, as people along the Green Line Extension route receive weekly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8168.448s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if we could just ask for that, but I just don't want to send out the wrong message that a cease and desist<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8174.19s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: is something that we have any control over whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8177.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8690.475s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Camuso, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8692.937s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: What do you think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8694.921s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I posed this to the body in the form of a resolution, having a committee of the whole and take up all papers that are in all subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8703.047s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We have stuff in there from 2007 that just never dealt with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8707.631s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Or they could have been acted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8708.892s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: They could have been acted upon, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8710.973s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I looked at the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8711.854s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So in other words, every time the clerk prints out the city council tracking sheet for subcommittees, committees of the whole, it's just wasting ink and paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8720.401s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Therefore, I think that this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8722.107s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: time where, especially with two members of the council are moving on into retirement, it would be the appropriate time to clean up the business beforehand of this particular council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8731.956s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I think it's a good idea, but whatever the council wishes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8736.2s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if we want to keep stuff in certain committees, you keep it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8738.562s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: But there is stuff that works itself out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8749.657s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So everybody has to call a subcommittee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8751.638s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the subcommittee meetings would have to be called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8766.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I mean, whatever procedurally we decide to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8774.237s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I agree 100%, but I also think we have to do whatever the proper procedure is to clear up the council tracking resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8781.081s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's 17 pages long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8782.861s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I say that in a funny fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8785.423s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It's not 17 pages, but it's quite lengthy, and it's stuff that we're talking about buildings that don't even exist in our community anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8792.226s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We get papers, and they're talking about the DPW water building that burned down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8796.148s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The water building is no longer there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8800.891s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Whatever the proper procedure is, I think we should address all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8812.147s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If not, you guys deal with it next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8822.234s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Do you want to do it on a Friday night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8825.777s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: No, we can do it this Thursday, 10 o'clock, instead of going to Medford-Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7445.787s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7445.967s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Martin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7914.345s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8010.215s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Martin, can I just remind you that you're here to talk about the police personnel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8082.689s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Martin, I don't want to cut you off, but some of these things you're talking about, the police department does deal with these very specific on very limited occasions when it does happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8094.692s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: To make the inception that the police don't deal with any... Oh, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8099.873s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I just think we're going down a slippery road where we're painting a pigeon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8103.714s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You're entitled to your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8108.625s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: You have a right to address the city council when what the council president deems in people's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8134.493s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And they also have an EAP program that's sponsored by the city of Medford, which is open to all employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8141.356s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: If they feel the need for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8145.834s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8244.523s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: We all do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8248.907s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And if I may, just one point from the chair on the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8253.85s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Any details that are in the West Medford area, when something happens at Medford High School that's a serious situation, it will be additional bodies that were not working in the city of Medford responding to a catastrophic event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8264.358s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So the details provide a tremendous value to the people in this community, not monetary,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8270.029s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: but public safety-wise, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8272.871s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8293.585s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: More than today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8322.318s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Just to play the devil's advocate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8324.178s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Maybe there's not a lot of people here because there are many people in this community out of that 57,000 that think we have one of the best police departments around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8331.623s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=46.437s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Be it resolved that the Department of Public Work repaint the crosswalks at Method Street and Albion Street in the interest of public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=53.541s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Mr. Del Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=54.682s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=56.302s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As the weather gets nicer, the DPW is embarking upon the repainting of the crosswalks, specifically Medford Street and Albion Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=64.746s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Very busy intersection, and a lot of the children in the South Medford neighborhood use that to get to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=70.549s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So if they can get that on the top of the list when they're out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=75.591s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Vice President Del Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=109.709s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So it's amended by vice president Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=244.584s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=244.965s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And that's a wonderful question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=246.525s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Um, but when citizens of Medford that walk that area every day, reach out to any of their elected officials in the community, it's our job to respond in a favorable manner to get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=256.983s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So as long as people continue to call me regarding city issues, I'm going to keep bringing them up, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=262.628s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And we don't pick and choose issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=264.27s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: As I stated in my brief speech, as they're embarking on painting all the crosswalks, but this is one is particular public safety concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=272.813s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: where all the kids that are on the other side of Medford Street have to cross a main street to go to an elementary school, the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=305.093s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Can the record reflect these ones as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=308.096s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=309.578s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: In front of the pool and also on Medford Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=317.825s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: First week in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=589.102s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=590.843s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: Another one that I got over the weekend was for Dartmouth and Yale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=594.864s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I sent it under suspension, but it's not in our packet to the clerk, so if we could just add it to this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=599.266s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It can be amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1080.669s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: And thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1084.133s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: It is something that we need to have answers to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1087.137s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: I know that some of the locations that were suggested got a little pushback from some of the neighbors because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1095.578s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: The dog park is great, but when you look at an area like the Sheepfold, it's very secluded, it's out of the way, people don't have to hear the dogs barking at 6 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1104.365s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: and the feces on the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1107.848s">[Paul Camuso]</a>: So, with that being said, I think there has to be some sort of a committee with neighborhood input from any area that the mayor may be proposing this.<br><br>
