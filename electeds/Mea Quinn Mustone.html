    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=168.909s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6500.758s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=787.589s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2395.325s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2396.065s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2396.586s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2398.167s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just curious about the mini class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2400.289s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think the advantage of that with Mr. Skorka was that he was so accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2403.832s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And he was such a gift to the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2405.954s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I remember one student saying to me, everyone should have Mr. Skorka in their life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2409.797s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think everyone would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2411.459s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2413.36s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: besides that he had a gift and a vocation for that work, are you going to hire someone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2418.584s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are you posting, I don't know if his title was formerly assistant director, but I think it's hard to do the work unless you're in a classroom in the hallways with kids because they're coming and going as we all know with teenagers and to pin them down, that was the advantage of the power of Mr. Skorka.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2433.575s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: He was always available for every student all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2451.153s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So will you replace a lead teacher at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2454.415s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just think it's hard for kids to get work done when there's not an adult who's always available to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2496.419s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So will the advisor be the mini course teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2564.041s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2564.641s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't think it's going to be as successful with not having a lead teacher as the advisor because he was just always available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2572.686s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I mean, I just know from my own senior who had been very involved and from her classmates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2578.629s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I guess my recommendation would be ideal if the advisor was the lead teacher because then the kids have wonderful ideas that take a lot of footwork to get them happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2588.314s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's my only concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=3026.436s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That one's from Amazon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=3336.979s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I also think Mr. Jackson sounds like a great candidate for the CCSR advisor program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=139.9s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I am sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=140.72s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1452.34s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Melanie, just, sorry, I'm on my phone, which I'm not used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1454.942s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm taking a little minute to get used to doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1458.964s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I agree with everyone that everyone's saying, and it's, I can't believe we don't already do all this for our parents and making sure all the kids are included in all the school activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1468.791s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I just, I'm trying to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1470.973s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are we writing a policy to just like, is it looking for funding to make sure that staff's available for like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1479.903s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What do we need to do to make this happen that everything is available for all the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3098.681s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Second, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3209.873s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3212.738s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3215.02s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4548.507s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4549.468s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4549.949s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you member Graham every stone tour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4552.212s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you for connecting with everyone over the last week that's great to reach out to the formal and the rec department, I'm excited about them starting a youth track program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4560.121s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I'm just wondering is there coach app or job website for coaches specifically I know it's posted on NPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4568.763s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And is it posted on school spring or spring school yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4595.975s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And is it that you've looked and there's no, I don't know about coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4599.136s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just don't imagine there would be a specific coaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7056.76s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I can wait if you're going off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7120.579s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, I was just going to say, could one of the goals be to expand our finance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7126.762s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I love that in the budgetary priorities, you have a theater teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7131.425s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think just the option of expanding or the goal of expanding more theater electives, both in the middle school and the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7140.269s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And if we could even increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7142.489s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: the music options in the middle school and the high school, which of course would take on more staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7147.17s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I really think we've all received a number of emails with all the benefits of theater and music for students, both in the middle school and the high school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7156.791s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9148.859s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9150.081s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9151.013s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9152.734s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I might've missed it for old business, but last week the student rep Noah had brought up about the locked bathrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9159.657s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I don't remember if there was gonna be a follow-up about the schedule of the bathrooms, locked bathrooms, or just to respond to Noah's inquiry about when they're locked or when they're unlocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=904.487s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=906.529s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=907.149s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One is to Member Graham's point about that we might not all be there because there'll be an election in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=911.972s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I want to say this will be my last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=913.933s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So for community members and parents out there, please consider running or consider encouraging friends and family to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=920.557s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's been a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=923.158s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: An interesting seven and a half years and I think eight years is a good time for a public servant to bow out and let pass on the torch to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=932.406s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the next one is that recently we've had many emails about arts and music and the benefits to children and teens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=941.174s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think I'd like a goal to be almost a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=944.597s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: a deep dive into our finance department and see if there's places we can expand or ideas that other schools are incorporating that are successful that we could look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=954.087s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But in addition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=956.768s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was able to go to two of the concerts in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=960.209s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't even know what month we're in, but they were wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=962.809s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the parents all there and grandparents all had such wonderful things to say about the fine arts department and the music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=968.671s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I know the music department has started the jumpstart camp and has expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=972.431s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think it's been beneficial to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=974.932s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So just, I think expanding fine arts would be a goal for myself and a lot of parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=980.973s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6058.864s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much for all that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6060.966s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is there any conversation about adding another language to the world language department I know in the past people had emailed, both for Chinese Arabic, or even sign language and I didn't know if that was a conversation to expand the languages we offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8510.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah, thank you for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8513.045s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, personally, Declan's in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8516.788s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I feel like his writing is not what his older siblings were doing in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8523.034s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is there a writing curriculum that goes along with what's happening now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8527.219s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Or is that something that you're also looking into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8631.0s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: My college roommate is a teacher in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8633.76s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: She sent me the podcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8637.861s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8638.781s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we had a conversation not too long ago about it, but also the whole science of reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8644.383s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8645.888s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would you say, because the hybrid year of COVID are going out March of 2020, has the science of reading not been part of professional development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8695.074s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm just thinking of my own having kids from 2002 to 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8698.716s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Quinn never did phonics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8703.55s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So she's the 20-year-old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8705.511s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I guess my concern is the teachers who went to school and learned the science of reading, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8712.714s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm getting the, not the phonics part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8891.807s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you think our teachers, because they were teaching the non-phonics version for so long, it's hard to break into now going back to phonics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8972.66s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You said you bring it in grade three, you bring it in grade four and five and different cycles or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4119.758s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4123.802s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4125.965s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4138.638s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4143.237s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: fifth class was added to bring it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4145.338s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4151.12s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the average class size?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4154.381s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4162.965s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know Declan has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5048.021s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So does it automatically they let the kids I mean 65 minutes seems like a long time for a fourth grader under reading to be working on a test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5058.176s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it doesn't cut them off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5059.457s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It lets them go for as long as they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5357.8s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5360.602s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I think what that question was trying to get at is more, how much of time and learning is this taking away?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5367.691s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: from the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5369.292s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So for example, you know, if a classroom, a second grade classroom has, you know, 12 kids who finish in a half an hour and then has seven more that keep going, the teacher's not going to move ahead with the curriculum that day when she knows that seven kids are not going to be able to be with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5390.379s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm curious if there's a way at some point in the future to get data<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5395.205s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: more on kind of how much time and learning this takes from the classroom, not just how much individual students or the average student is, you know, to take the test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.138s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.558s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just, you know, I know that I personally I hear from parents who are concerned about how much testing is being done between the MCAS, this test,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5539.143s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: practice and tasks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5540.423s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And so just in terms of being able to understand, trying to balance what is the value of the task versus how much time it's taking away from time learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5551.98s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5552.28s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I agree with you about the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7178.562s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Marks just disappeared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4498.957s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4499.097s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4500.398s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So three of our kids are going on the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4503.519s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I will be not chaperoning for a 24-hour train ride, but if you do get Southwest, then I would like to volunteer to chaperone if you get that flight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4512.683s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So thank you, but Teague and Nevin and Rowan seem to be very excited that they think it's the Orient Express that they're going on to Florida.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11985.797s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11986.84s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you everybody for all the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11989.262s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I do feel like I'm kind of in a time warp because it was probably more than five years ago, or maybe just about, I don't think many people in this room were there then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11998.147s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There was a concern with MCAS that the Brooks had nailed it in every area, in every grade, in every subject, and unfortunately other schools did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12006.412s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And what came up was Title I, the three schools had Title I, but the Brooks still had a reading specialist that did the work of Title I, but wasn't paid for by Title I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12015.109s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: At the Roberts, I know firsthand, oh, I can figure it out, because Quinn was in second grade, and now she's a sophomore in college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12019.852s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's how long ago it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12021.513s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So she tested for Title I. Unfortunately, she was not the lowest of the seven that made it to Title I. So her teacher said, unfortunately, she's not the lowest of the seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12032.44s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You're right, she definitely has a reading hiccup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12035.402s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I said, so if she was in another class or another school, she might have been the lowest of the seven, depending who her peers were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12041.966s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think, and tell me if I'm not saying what people are thinking, but I think that's where the concern is like we have schools that have much greater need, but they still have the same staff as the Brooks who's doing great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12055.457s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think that's where the frustrations coming from like shouldn't we put the support for the school that might have 14 kids who really need title one but only seven of them are eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12204.881s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And right, we have math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12206.843s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Remember what the yeah, the teacher had been out and then the replacement was out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12221.852s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But no, but it's a good conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12247.774s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's good news too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12255.964s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You said they're back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12256.864s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I thought you meant they increased their numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12273.248s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So more support should go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12275.189s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12400.864s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you want me to read?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12402.787s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12403.247s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12403.928s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You want to go home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12466.153s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are the meetings in person at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=13671.065s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is 46 the one that goes to the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/U-vb-ame39Y&t=92.249s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1321.709s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1322.929s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was just wondering, I saw, I don't know if you want to go two slides back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1326.65s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So last year there was 199 ninth graders who did CTE, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1334.012s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It jumped to 269 this current year for ninth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1342.289s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: How many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.39s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.55s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's a very large percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1360.217s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1369.725s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1382.575s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1413.658s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.669s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.969s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.229s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.569s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1450.67s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=93.385s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=95.426s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=177.614s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: On the calendar, does it say July 3rd, when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=183.211s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=183.971s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=413.178s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=413.538s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm happy with my evaluation and I haven't heard anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=417.278s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just going by the emails that were sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=419.479s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I also just thought we were, it was Melanie who felt like that they are Melanie didn't feel like she, um, fills out the evaluation correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=427.86s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And so that's why we're meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=429.06s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then it was just to make her changes to be put in for the average score, I guess, because we didn't, I didn't see anyone else's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=437.662s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=930.524s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4951.145s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Hi, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4951.886s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think we're probably wrapping up since it's 528.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4954.448s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But two points, which I wasn't sure if other people are going to touch upon them before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4958.532s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I didn't want to repeat my colleagues sentiment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4962.255s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For communication, I know teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4965.367s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: spoke to me about just more communication directly with the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4969.632s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We do all appreciate the newsletter for the families, but maybe there could be a separate newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4974.456s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly, just for the teachers to know what's happened academically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4980.622s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Schedule-wise for the different grade levels, or maybe some points of information that are coming down from DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4988.473s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, teachers on across the board know where you are coming with with your vision or your goals I think that would be helpful so they all know why things are getting implemented because this is what you're hoping to do to benefit public schools to make them better for every child which I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5004.693s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know without a doubt that you are thinking of every child every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5008.556s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the second part is now that COVID is subsiding and that we can, I know you love to do the data stuff and that we have science that is rolled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5020.385s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We have math that is mid rolled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5022.767s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And now also, now it's time to look at the English for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5029.438s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: ELA for all grades and for social studies slash history slash civics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5037.082s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I think now that we have more time because you have less responsibility with COVID decisions, which you had to make those on a daily basis, that I think parents, those are my two things that parents have said to me recently, is now talk about English, social studies, and teaches more communication directly with the teachers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5058.58s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that's, I think other than that, I know you are on the clock 24 hours a day, every day of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5065.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think most of the community understands that and appreciates that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5071.123s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I just look forward to now, you know, I guess going back to when you were hired and your goals then, now, you know, you were slowed down with COVID, but now you can kick it back into gear and it's exciting to see what Medford Public Schools are gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5086.287s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So thank you, Dr. Maurice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5139.878s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5140.198s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We're all on the same team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2457.464s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I also want to just thank you all because I think it's been years that you were lobbying for the adaptive physical education teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2465.461s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And this past year has been awesome with the United basketball program that I know Miss Kyla Andre ran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2470.985s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And so I just want people to know that CPAC really gets stuff done and that if they're looking to get something done to join your group, because you guys are the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2478.79s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4061.145s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if they would give us a discount because they have the whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4064.027s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if we could look into that, I'm happy to call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4066.929s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yep, we definitely can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4828.977s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right, so Derek and I haven't met in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4830.738s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Derek is a dad who has some words he'd like to share if there could be a suspension to hear from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=9.825s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I, of course, can't figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=12.427s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was from a CCD class on Sunday morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=171.068s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5409.072s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3674.538s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There is a bus line item budget for the Machi band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3676.98s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5169.874s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5170.834s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I understand it's a lot when you just read it out loud, but I also know that since I've been on for six years, we have been asking to have a system like the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5179.577s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we know, just thinking right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5182.535s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We talked about the McGlynn roof that kindergarten classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5185.297s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm imagining it got fixed because we haven't heard from parents or teachers, but we never got an official response back from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5191.902s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We had students here about the bathrooms at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5194.264s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We hear that they're getting built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5195.825s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We haven't had an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5196.946s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There's no way to look for me to say to parents when they reach out to me, oh, yep, the bathrooms are coming in May of 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5203.732s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We had the girls locker room that parents emailed regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5207.716s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Unfortunately, the students at the high school is still telling me that the locker room has not had a great facelift that it's still looking similar to that it looked in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5217.026s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, I understand when you read it out loud but I feel like those are quick entries of a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5224.577s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: the person who said it, the meeting time for the subcommittee, but it is frustrating as a school committee member that parents email us repeatedly and we don't have answers for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5236.123s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think it's just almost getting into the habit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5239.125s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Everything is hard at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5241.146s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then we kind of get into a flow with school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5243.367s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We'll say the things more clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5245.168s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the minutes can be more clear for the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5250.031s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: minute takers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5252.317s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I do think this is something that's very necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5254.704s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know if there was a first if I can be the second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5258.2s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There is a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4330.623s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4330.923s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think for anyone interested in robotics and engineering, the laser cutter is amazing and we'll have a lot of future engineers because of that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4341.27s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the teachers too, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4343.011s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5205.533s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you for volunteering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5206.633s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just wondering, is the school administration part of this group at present?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5212.695s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Or have you talked to Chief Buckley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5221.817s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5223.357s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you want- Member Grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5228.378s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then, member Rousseau, because we're taught with the masks associated school committees,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5235.987s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You can't represent us right or you can't speak as a school committee member you're going to report back to us to make sure what they're proposing follows education law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3695.67s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member of the stone and it's your just a quick question I don't in past years with after-school programs like the handshines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3704.316s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: that kids who did the YMCA afterschool program weren't available to, didn't have the transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3709.979s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can kids who go to the YMCA at Chevalier be able to take a late bus there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3714.881s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just to make that clear to families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3716.482s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Each school will have one late bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3718.703s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And their own late bus to whatever stop they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3721.304s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3721.584s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4525.415s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member miss stone, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4528.306s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: How do students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4529.537s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do they self-identify that they want to do the math program or would math teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4563.098s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4563.418s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So students who struggle with math, and this is, I'm speaking as a parent of kids who struggle with math, it would be hard to sell them on five hours a day of math over a vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4576.321s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is there some sort of incentive we can give to the students who participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=40.746s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1791.238s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The part about reviewing the instructional practices policies, anything written, do you like highlight it and say, this needs to be worked on and give us a revision or do you leave us to do the revisioning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1864.913s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1865.554s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Dr. Maurice, do you think the recommendations that we are given by the equity process come May, would they go to the Racial Equity Committee to put them into action or will we address that later on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1924.033s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1924.493s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1926.835s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8683.882s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm not sure if it's for Mr. Cushing or Dr. Maurice, but have the engagement specialist have a better handle on absenteeism, which I know some kids, because of retention or absence, end up going to summer school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8701.093s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So do you know if that is the attendance better with engagement specialists this year in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9653.49s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I had my hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9654.671s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9655.231s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9655.651s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I didn't see it, I didn't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9658.272s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau, is, just because it's worthy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9662.966s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can people, I know on the last meeting, people could still write to us, to the school committee email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9672.028s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm one ahead, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10654.131s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That doesn't help, the people not on the Rules Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10656.212s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah, I was gonna say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11205.434s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think we all get very tired when we have those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11217.762s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Wednesday's not going to be there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12643.156s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12644.518s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=484.822s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think in the past that the mayor had gone with what people thought were priorities and then named the subcommittees and then asked each of us which subcommittees we would like to be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=496.353s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know the subcommittees have changed by title with different concerns that have come up in the previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=502.94s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I would say put the mayor for designating the names of the subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1549.87s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just want to say I got it for Teagan and it was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1552.25s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I forwarded to Teagan and said, these are your people if you need them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1554.911s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it was to the point and what we needed to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1576.064s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1577.284s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, with all the different groups, which they were, they looked great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1581.786s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So thank you for doing all those groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1982.994s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6083.261s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right, thanks, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6084.963s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If I could just ask the students, if you're comfortable, both of you had referred to moving forward and taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6090.648s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could you tell us what you shared with the administration, what you would like to see happen at the high school, if you feel comfortable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6098.016s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Or send me an email with what you shared with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6102.24s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.192s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.752s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know Mr. Cushing talked about staff shortages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6193.074s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for any sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6198.863s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: subcontracting with maybe an employment agency, or I know I've heard students talk about hall monitors, which I can't, we don't have enough powers of substitutes, but is there any, I guess, hope for more staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1486.185s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1486.966s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, I was thinking just having two girls at the Andrews and how popular so many of the clubs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1495.491s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know that the CCSR is partnering with a mom who's teaching a sewing class to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1504.488s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: create toiletry bags, and then collect goods to stuff in the toiletry bags to give to the Bread of Life in Malden for their guests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1513.691s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I didn't know, back to Tonya was talking about the buddy program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1517.332s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I didn't know if that could be a place that all kids could come together, pack the bags with their peers, and then follow up with maybe doing service projects together in conjunction with the buddy program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1534.059s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know if that would be something that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1651.848s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I guess just to move forward, could I work with someone at the Andrews Middle School to at least get, I think this will be a short, successful service project that we could have all kids involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1669.565s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know if anyone wants, I don't know if I'm overstepping or if that's something I can reach out and work with the teachers at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1694.023s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's miss been doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1695.424s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And it's just, I think it's, it's, it's nice because the kids will have, they'll be able to see their impact so the sewing club is going to make the toiletry bags, and then they're going to do a drive for you know, little toothpaste or deodorant or what have you, they have a list from bread of life, it will go into the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1715.822s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And so, and I think it will just be a few, probably a few days that we'll meet after school to compile the toiletry bags and then pack up my van.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1724.345s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I think it'd be a great place for kids to be together and doing something fun and service to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1745.628s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then I just don't know if there's teachers, Joan, you would know who the best teachers are to invite?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1769.171s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And this literally just started in an email yesterday so we are fresh, you know, we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1773.814s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We're not joining something that's happening it's just just an email started yesterday so we are all together at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1779.758s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1787.382s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is that the- I don't think so because they'll have to have a while to sew and the mom who sews has two groups because she only has 14 sewing machines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1796.625s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think she'll be a while before all the sewing kids will be able to sew their own toiletry bags.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1800.946s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm thinking probably more of the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1802.947s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1912.107s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, then I'll email you tomorrow, Joan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1914.751s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right, sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1915.453s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And whoever else wants to be on the email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1916.735s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'll email everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=2679.772s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3333.133s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3334.394s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can you just explain how the referral system works for people to see these hub leaders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3344.823s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But they're in the schools now, but are they not seeing kids directly yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3431.377s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But is there a ballpark of how many students say they've seen at the four elementary schools combined?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3475.505s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right, I guess I'm just, I'm trying to figure out, is there an epidemic happening that there's a lot of families that aren't engaged and we need more than five team specialists?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3485.987s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are they seeing five kids a day or are they seeing one a week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3576.993s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: specialist has met a family and they need a lot of assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3581.337s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then do they then meet weekly with the adjustment Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3584.56s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do we need more adjustment Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3586.001s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Or I guess it's too early to learn what we're going to need after the engagement specialist are meeting with all these families and students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3662.148s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then at the end of this year, will the initiative tell us what we should be prioritizing with staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3668.891s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I imagine there's going to be a need for more staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3673.063s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: there's many families being referred to the specialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3690.773s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The specialist is like a caseworker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3692.714s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So they're not seeing students one-on-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3696.556s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3696.976s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3697.356s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I didn't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3698.137s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So they can meet with students one-on-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3701.372s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: to have a counseling session are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5914.588s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's been years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5917.765s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'll let you finish, but then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6006.353s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, I know it was long before you got here, but the teachers from those classrooms have been emailing for years that periodically they had flooding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6015.36s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I am a little upset that it took a parent to come here with pictures to finally get the ball rolling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6023.787s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And this is long before you were here, Mr. Murphy, but I guess moving forward and Kathy and I can both speak from being on the building and grounds committee over the years, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6034.856s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: not administrators, teachers or staff members would complain of a building issue and it never was addressed until it seems like a parent came and then it was addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6046.561s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm trying to figure out moving forward, how does the school committee, when we hear of these concerns, get the physical building concerns addressed without having to have a parent come out on a school night, take photocopies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6061.775s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 18 pitches times the eight of us here to move forward on our physical structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=38.697s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3675.98s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Nurse Avery, could students take a picture of their COVID vaccination card and just email it to your address or the school that, if it's middle school or a high schooler, like what's the best way to get it to you so you know who's vaccinated in our school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3689.506s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Something you can do when she gets home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3720.863s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, just as you know, I have two middle schoolers and a high schooler, I'm okay with the vaccine being out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3726.508s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if people aren't comfortable, a paper copy sent to the office with the nurse office on the envelope, or take a picture and email it to any school nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7802.837s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I appreciate Member Ruseau bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7805.3s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I do think it brings us to another point, which the parents on the line can probably relate, is that we still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7812.805s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: fill out a paper copy of all of our information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7816.287s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I can remember a year that there was six forms for my medical, six forms for the emergency contact, six forms of my family biography.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7825.912s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think that ties in because if we did all of that information online, we could just export the parent one, parent two, guardian one, guardian two, to be able to have it on a white list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7841.06s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think it's doable because I know if I email teachers from my Yahoo email, all the teachers can get it and Tegan, my sophomore, can get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7849.166s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it is something that we can handle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7851.667s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I do think, like Member Ruseau said, we did have a number of parents who said they're not at the point where they want to give their fourth grader a phone, but they do want to touch base during the day or put on a thread with the teacher about concerns of their child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7868.058s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I guess mine is probably the a two-part to could we talk about getting all of our information online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7876.643s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You know there's family ID and Ravenna and all these school information sites that I think is an important step for us to move forward and I don't know if that should be an own motion or if we can tie it in but I definitely think we need to step up with our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7897.428s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: technology and family information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7900.11s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8583.398s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could a school information system possible quote be moved in as well with that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8591.902s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I do think the papers, I just, in this day and age, the papers for the bus pass, the emergency contact, the, I don't know if it's called family biography or what the top of the one is, that it's teeny tiny lines and teeny tiny space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8611.272s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, but I think if we go to a school information system that the parents is more user friendly, so I'm not sure if that could be included to just quote some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8620.341s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know three offhand because I know other schools who use them, but I would appreciate if that could be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8626.547s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8650.816s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8654.099s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=10039.153s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=10042.576s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=74.065s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What if we just, oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=77.571s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you guys mind if I check my sound?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=79.273s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can someone say hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=80.255s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=81.577s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=82.778s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right, the sound is working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=84.12s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=84.902s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I have a lot of help here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=86.564s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Hello, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=135.897s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think we're all overtired in our house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=137.638s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We're all a little slap happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3094.167s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3094.647s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3095.688s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3097.18s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, correct me, because I'm getting all the budgets confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3100.121s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For transportation, I saw that both Mr. Maloney talked about after school, late buses for middle school, Andrews and McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3108.602s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then also Mr. Textera mentioned to do something with the ELL students with the late bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3115.103s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is the transportation budget, have we not seen it yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3118.944s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Or is it the meeting I missed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3178.321s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3178.862s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3180.221s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then the other question was, now I'm looking to, I'm sorry that, Paul or Mayor, you can ask someone else and I'll get back to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3267.364s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2150.01s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2151.931s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2154.671s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you guys all for all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2156.532s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2157.592s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Schulman, I think it's a great idea about the school Councilor for the ELL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2162.754s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I didn't know if 0.6 is enough for both middle school and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2167.235s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If it was possible, that position could be increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2171.79s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Cause I do think it's probably a good idea to have a both a middle school and high school and to have someone who's just 0.6 try to go between three buildings would be a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2182.472s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then the next, and I'm not sure Mr. Murray, if it's the gym teacher, would that be under a different department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2194.814s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We had talked about an adaptive gym teacher for the last, I wanna say at least two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2201.12s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, so I, if that's a different department, I can hold it to another meeting, but I just want to get some clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2219.737s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2220.757s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I did it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2221.338s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I said, Mr. Murray, because Colin's teacher is David Murray, who I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2232.063s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4404.83s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4406.431s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, I don't know if it's possible for you to screen share page seven, which lists the superintendent's draft recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4417.94s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That'd be great if you can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4418.96s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, superintendent, I love your recommendations because I think those are things that we have learned through community and teachers and parents that are necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4428.968s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For the page seven,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4433.956s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is this the... That is the one, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4436.677s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So page seven, and now I'm gonna, sorry, Mr. Murphy, can you go to page eight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4443.818s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just cause I was just highlighting what is in both the director's request and both the superintendent's direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4452.02s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's not the one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4461.068s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's the one, it was in my package, page seven and then page eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4464.909s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it's, I think it's the whole department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4469.77s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4475.052s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So at the top, so they pretty, I guess, I don't know if you can probably see mine, but it lines up except under the director's personnel priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4491.087s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So under the director's personnel priorities, it lists two, four, six, eight, 10, 11, 12, 13 bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4498.894s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All of the director's priorities are in the superintendent's recommendations except for the director's has three bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4509.344s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One is behavior specialist at four specialists,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4513.528s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One is a meet ETL position and one is an administrative assistant for the Curtis Tufts High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4519.831s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So they all sound like they are worthy priorities to be getting on the superintendent's recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4528.915s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I wish I was tech savvy enough to show you just the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4533.081s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: the two papers that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4535.282s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I love the superintendent's recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4537.583s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'd love for us to make a motion to get them into the budget, but I do think it's important to add the three that didn't make it to the superintendent's recommendations that were on the director's personnel priorities, which is the behavior specialist, the meet ETL position, and the administrative assistant for the Curtis Tufts High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4556.449s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if you know what I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4559.99s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It was page seven and eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4561.828s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's a Joan Bowen's report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4797.239s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4797.62s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4798.581s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know how all the schools and all the departments, their backstory to all of them, but I would, um, I do would like to make a motion that the superintendent's recommendations, cause those are the ones that you vetted more than the directors or the principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4812.111s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, I would like to make a recommendation that we move forward to include the recommendations in the, in the budget, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4853.28s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I can, because I think, what is today, Thursday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4855.921s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Did we meet on Tuesday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4857.921s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And you had followed up with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4859.242s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I am comfortable with making a motion that all four of the recommendation level priorities are included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7141.189s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Very good, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7142.55s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The motion was just that the superintendent's recommendations, the four levels are included in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7151.477s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4603.262s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4604.883s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, I don't know if it's possible for you to share one of the slide decks that talks, has the superintendent's draft recommendations, any school, anyone, just so people know what I'm referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4617.57s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4621.05s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: hard to get a visual or for me to explain it accurately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4629.217s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So you can just go to the first one you see that has the... Yeah, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4634.702s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Where'd you go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4636.304s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Down further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4637.405s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The one that lists critical FY22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4638.906s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4641.208s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4642.308s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I just want to talk about this slide or this part of the budget, because it's for all the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4650.512s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And as people can see, it says critical FY and the example of textbooks and the next one long term budgetary priorities, literacy and math coach positions, which we all know are necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4662.036s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then additional, like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4664.618s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: said, the water filling and playground equipment, which we know is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4668.263s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, Mr. Murphy, I'm just wondering, because I understand that everything is so departmentalized here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4676.492s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So these numbers on the right were not in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4680.69s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: this school's budget at the end of this part of this school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4683.931s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So are these line budget items going to be under a different department or are these something we would add to the end of this elementary ed budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4820.475s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So there's- Okay, just so I know how to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4826.296s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Building-based literacy and math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4828.417s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Coaches are specialists or interventionists, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4832.077s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would that go under Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4834.978s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kahn and the math department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4836.558s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then I just have to make a mental note when Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4838.838s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kahn presents to make sure there's math<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4842.835s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: specialist in there or do I just make a note when we go through it at the end to make sure there's literacy and math specialist?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4850.821s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just, I love the superintendent's recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4854.283s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think the critical ones are a definite and the long-term budgetatory priorities are a definite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4860.628s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I just wanna figure out how I can work with everyone to make sure at least those two top portions of the recommendations make it at the end of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4991.654s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4991.815s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4992.597s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could you scroll up for a minute just to another slide above this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4997.872s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just, nope, one more up, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5000.614s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just right here, just for parents and community members, because I was confused when I read this this morning, where you have grade levels pre-K to five, budget FTEs 28, actual FTEs 82.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5014.006s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could you explain that to our community members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5017.148s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because I had no idea what the heck that meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5096.585s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5097.646s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5098.486s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5099.146s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I have no more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5100.066s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6842.962s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just because we're coming up, it's 8.56, I would, just because things move quickly and items are added or items are discarded, could I make a motion that at least the top two parts of the superintendent's recommendations are included<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6860.735s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: in the right budget, whether it's under special education or transportation or math department or elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6869.242s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So under it would be the critical FY22 budgetary priorities, and then the next group, the long-term budgetary priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6885.853s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it's really, it's the summary at the end of each school that shows the superintendent's recommendations and it's by priority level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6894.543s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think the first two priority levels are definitely necessities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6900.67s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There's a third that says additional budgetary priorities worthy of consideration that I think we can consider at a later time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6907.793s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then it's COVID mitigation priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6909.713s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So there's a recommendation for each school, but I would just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6915.595s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: like to see the top two levels included under the right department or grade level just because I think the superintendent has listened to us over the past year and knows this is what the community has shared with us and teachers have shared with us and these are things that are necessary to move our children forward in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2181.052s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2181.732s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2183.617s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Our personnel and budget committee, we had member Van der Kloot and member Kreatz present, and our assistant superintendent, Mr. Murray, shared our dates for the upcoming budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2195.564s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if we can screen share the dates so people can see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2200.766s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And Mr. Murphy, I'm sorry, Collins teachers, Mr. David Murray, and you have Mr. David Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2206.369s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I always confuse the two of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2208.01s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No problem at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2212.873s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we went through the dates in the process for budget season, which will be upon us sooner than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2221.075s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And this is just for people to make notes of when they would like to tune in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2226.917s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We have not set an exact time yet, just waiting for everyone's schedules to be consolidated so we can see what time is best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2237.6s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, I don't know if you have anything to add about under each topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2243.13s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: they encompass more than everything that's listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2310.593s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2311.093s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member McLaughlin, I'm not sure if I call on you because it's the building subcommittee, or Maya, do you call on Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=75.586s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And now to move on to the agenda, we have one item on the agenda regarding the budget hearings and dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=83.472s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I will turn it over to Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=353.947s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=355.127s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I'm calling one of my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=720.941s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And a parent in the chat did ask if there'd be an opportunity for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=726.043s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Mr. Andre Hina, if you would like to speak, we are happy to hear your comment or question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=743.458s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=970.258s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just for the record, could you state your address and it can be registered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=978.46s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=979.361s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I do appreciate what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=981.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I do see Paulette's hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=983.884s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1043.893s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I also, Mr. Murphy, and I was just gonna ask you and you might know the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1047.754s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I do think this is a longer conversation to come up with some solutions or remedies for, because as Mr. Kena said, it has been an ongoing issue after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1062.097s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm not sure if that would be what subcommittee it would fall under to have a more robust conversation than under this budget scheduling meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1264.103s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1291.704s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, all right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1294.445s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are there any other community members who would like to speak or have any questions about our budget schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1307.765s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Mr. Murphy, I imagine we'll either move it to a subcommittee or a committee of the whole, but what night would afterschool program fall under?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1316.891s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would it be under elementary ed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1328.638s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The central office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1343.168s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: May 12th, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1344.168s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So for folks about afterschool program, I don't wanna make any promises, but hopefully we can either move it to a subcommittee or a committee of the whole before May 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1356.67s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then May 12th would be when Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1359.191s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Megan Fidler-Carey would be presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1392.592s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1405.383s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1406.264s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm just trying to think of the subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1413.07s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1413.27s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kreatz, your buildings and grounds, what else do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1419.782s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What other two do you, and you sit on personnel and budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1422.044s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Personnel, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1430.853s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then Paulette, what are the three you are on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1432.695s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Curriculum, this one, and...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1528.06s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1605.549s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1606.209s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1606.469s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think what's, oh, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1608.411s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1715.563s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1717.523s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think at this point, we'll have to work with Dr. Maurice and see if we'll either have it on the agenda for, I don't imagine it can be on this Monday, March 22nd, maybe our first meeting in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1730.746s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'll call a committee of the whole about it and I can make sure to reach out to Mr. Kina to give the date and it will obviously be published.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1740.588s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And member Van der Kloot, I see your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1887.482s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1889.464s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Any final questions or comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1893.564s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2043.912s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2141.067s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2143.207s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are there any other comments or questions regarding the budget schedule for April and May?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2149.609s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2152.929s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think that's all that was on the agenda to get through the process and the dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2159.17s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2202.232s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'll take a roll call for the motion to send the dates to the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2252.933s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, happy St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2253.574s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Patrick's Day for tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8770.601s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, I also signed on to the resolution with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8773.513s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau and Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8777.054s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I want to say the reason why we proposed it is because as we've learned of Columbus's legacy in recent times with more research and history, we realized that is not someone that we would like to hold up in a standard for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8792.82s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Most people know I have six children, four in Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8796.801s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: He is not someone that I want my children to think that's who we want to represent a school in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8805.284s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We've heard a lot of conversation on both sides tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8809.366s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I've had personal conversation with a number of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8811.987s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I have thought about it thoroughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8814.328s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I know that there are many other opportunities to name a school and that we're not erasing history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8825.094s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's that he is not someone that represents what I wanna teach my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8830.358s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I agree that he was a navigator, but other than that, there's nothing that I wanna encourage my children to say, this is someone that we admire and someone that I want you to look up to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8842.367s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think that's how I agreed with my family discussing it that I signed on with Mr. Russo and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8849.232s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8850.413s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17786.751s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That'd be a big committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18155.394s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18160.772s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I just, I mean, I can see that if they get many names, I know with all the emails we got, I would say we probably were maybe 30 to 40 names were suggested in the emails we received over the last nine months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18179.718s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then this is opened up to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18182.975s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I wonder if it will be a large number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18184.896s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So no, I mean on the advisory committee, how many, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18188.737s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If we're thinking about how much work they each have to do, they each get divvied up 40 names each to just, you know, Google their name and see what their story is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18195.94s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, so probably 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20730.677s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sure, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20736.141s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For number 15, if the advisory committee recommends a timeline change, which I hear what Kathy's saying, for the time crunch it is now, could it be that in the meantime, that we will refer to the Columbus School with the temporary name of the South Medford Elementary School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20760.765s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then it feels like we're moving forward, it's temporary, but if an extension is asked, if the advisory committee asked for an extension at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20899.039s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, I mean, my heart is with the Mystic, but for this process, I think just to be able to move forward with a temporary name while the advisory committee asks for more time, the South Medford Elementary School buys us more time with also recognizing that we are no longer honoring Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1636.298s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1640.703s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thanks, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1641.963s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Dr. Maurice, I just want to say I thought it was very telling that you scored so high on ethics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1648.205s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think that's what really shows the community or the community already sees it, that you are such a respectable or you respect others, you're respectable, you are open minded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1662.37s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You listen, you think about right and wrong, and you really work together with your team and with the families and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1669.773s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I was glad to see that ethical number, because I really do think you're one of the most justice-centered person I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1679.677s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2219.76s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=226.261s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3665.146s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3712.487s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3749.671s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4111.976s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9397.857s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9400.024s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I am the chair of the personnel and budget committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9402.965s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think my understanding was that the personnel and budget committee would come up with the dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9408.808s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I do think because in recent past practice, it has been committee of the holes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9414.17s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: that probably this year they should be committee of the wholes we would just set the date and the plan on the personnel and budget committee and then moving forward if that's more of how school committees um generally do it it's it's just past practice here that it's been committee of the whole so i think for this year for people to understand the process it would be the personnel and budget committee just to set<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9437.295s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: who we're hearing on what days, and then have committee of the wholes for all the sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9442.219s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then next year, talk about having a different budget process that's more streamlined and more community focused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9450.466s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I'm happy to hear how other districts do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9453.889s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think just in my experience for the last five years, or four years, this is how we've done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9458.834s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I hope that's a compromise that we can work with this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9462.157s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12114.193s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was gonna say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12116.982s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I've been to four high school graduations since coming on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12122.098s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I believe it's only one time that a student was recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12124.839s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I have to say, I was more impressed with that student than the other awards given, because I don't think it's a matter of kids being sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12133.421s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because I think I would say 99%, when my kids stay home, they're not sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12138.742s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They just want to have a day to stay home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12140.943s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't think we can assume that kids are sick who are perfect attendants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12145.524s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I do think it's something that the community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12149.465s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: respects of these students, their dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12151.726s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I hear everything you're saying, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12154.488s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I do think we need to hear from the parents of the students, because we're not hearing everyone's voice about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12162.793s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We're hearing, I think, a lot of the cons of it, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12168.516s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I mean, I've only seen it once in four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12171.458s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't think kids are struggling through the flu to make it to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12174.82s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think between just having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12179.613s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: good, I guess, good immune system and a good dedication to school that they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12185.018s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think that it was really something commendable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12188.962s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think the high school community really thought that student was deserving of it because I just, for my own kids, I know that 99% of the time they're not going to school because they're sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12202.596s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, and so I think I am with the mayor with, I think a conversation is still an important thing with the whole community at the rules and regulations about it so we can hear from other parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3731.869s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know it's short notice, but if there's any way you could do a reverse call, because I think that's a great information that parents shouldn't, I was planning on going in with Nevin and Rowan to the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3743.173s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3744.013s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If someone could put out a call that grade six through 12, the parents can wait in their car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3748.872s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: just because of the numbers in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3751.133s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know if that's too short notice to get a call out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=884.085s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And Paul, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=886.006s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think it was, well, now looking back, it was an oversight, because it was kind of Kathy and I transitioning, and Kathy was really the one who thought of a vision committee, and that's when she came on as chair of the buildings committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=899.934s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So really, Kathy, I don't know if you, you probably remember better than I do, because it was the vocational teacher who had come up and has presented when the buildings committee, I think it was the last meeting we transitioned together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14797.074s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14797.655s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14798.435s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just wanted to suggest, and you might already be doing it, Dr. Maurice, but could this be emailed through the different principals on the elementary level and the middle school levels directly to their school community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14811.085s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because I think when parents receive emails from the district, and I'll speak for myself, sometimes I don't read them all, because I think it's a lot of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14818.912s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But if I get one from Mr. Johnson or Mr. Downs, and I know it's specific to my kids' grades, I'll read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14825.077s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So maybe if it was the end of the slide deck was a suggestion about just getting it out there on social media or maybe on the Medford Public Schools Facebook page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14834.425s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I think an email from principals, because parents trust most of our principals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14840.535s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: that it's a resource that can be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14842.476s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think this is the time that parents, oh, Tegan's telling me I'm talking too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14848.377s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14848.897s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Tegan, leave her alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=292.807s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11259.4s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's what I was going to suggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11260.561s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because I know you're at the wire on Friday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11262.962s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I think even if they're uploaded by 5 o'clock on Monday, people can check it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11268.684s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: have it with them when they're on their phone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1727.129s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, thanks Miss Ray for all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1730.971s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It is really impressive all the work that nurses do and it seems like it almost is that a caseworker is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1739.214s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Excuse me, so when there's a vision screening and you send the referral letter, is there, I know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1745.894s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is there a follow-up to say, you got the referral letter, but did you actually go to the eye doctor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1770.464s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1770.664s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that's time consuming when they have kids waiting in their office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1774.487s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And even with, um, at the Curtis Tufts, when students want to go for management techniques, how do you have any idea of how many students a day go or how long they stay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1811.102s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And as the state mandates more and more on your department, do you think, is there a new profession for caseworkers in the nursing office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1819.846s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's all encompassed within our role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1851.865s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I guess we can wait till budget meetings, but it'd be that you would be hiring more nurses to take on all the casework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1858.248s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Possibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1858.628s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1859.289s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, I mean, it's incredible all the work they do at all the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1862.83s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2575.293s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The only question is, it seemed like all of them increased in a positive number except for the Columbus and Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2585.499s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could you look at it in more depth and if there was anything that you could see that you can address to make sure they go up next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2032.4s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All those present, none absent, please all rise to salute our flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3801.313s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I'm wondering if there's a way, if there's any surplus in the budget, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3805.875s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Patterson, if it would be cost effective to try to do four bathrooms if we're having a contracting company in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3812.798s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think it's, I'm glad we're trying to do two at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3817.648s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But from what I hear, all 16 need to be done now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3820.891s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm wondering if there's a way we can put our brains together to see if there's more free cash, or if there's a surplus at the end, or if this can be a priority in our budget hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4991.178s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4992.56s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4993.521s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Cheese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4994.922s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4995.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Cheese, Dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4998.666s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8348.732s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2552.911s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2554.211s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6067.957s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: This is hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6070.279s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You know, we were at home and I was saying to my kids, what will I say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6075.243s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because we weren't thinking we would be saying something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6080.255s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Teagan told me, well, you met her through the whole food security interest with the Greater Boston Food Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6088.465s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that was the first time we actually had a conversation after the first election four years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6093.252s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And we met with Carol Tynken from Greater Boston Food Bank and talked about making Metfed the first food secure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6099.479s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: City in the Commonwealth and that is still a goal that we're working at but it's with your help over the last few years that we have now a food pantry at the high school the summer eats program with the YMCA We've done pop-up mobile food markets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6113.044s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We have Columbus groceries and soon there'll be a community food pantry That'll be very exciting that you were behind making that community food pantry happen and I guess what Paul was saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6129.496s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You always had the children, and even Reptonado, you always had the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6134.319s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You always thought of them first, and how can you make their life on a daily basis better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6138.121s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6139.481s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the benefit was that because of food security, we got to be good friends, and I look forward to having more guidance and great conversations with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6127.049s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Megan, you probably want to sit down after all these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6131.71s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The process to apply, I know that, I guess, a year and a half ago, people showed up at the office and waited and see if you were lucky enough to be first in line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6142.352s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: How did it go this past sign up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6148.033s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, so this is the first time to try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6149.634s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So what is the plan for the new system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6199.669s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It will still be the first come first serve, like who's ever sleeps over outside the Columbus school or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6251.739s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you have a question which has come up now at least for two years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6254.741s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is this your third year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6255.861s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6256.562s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Second year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6257.002s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6257.302s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So maybe it's only come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6258.383s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Well, I think it came up before you were appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6261.404s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6262.505s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we've heard that everyone pays in a system, but you don't get to see what the program brings in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6268.568s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then you do pay for the snacks and the crafts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6271.631s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So are you now able to see your whole spreadsheet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6289.825s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6290.066s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What made me think of it was because the wage is going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6293.548s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's going to be a bump in your wages or your salary line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6297.872s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then will that, is that already planned for uncovered for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6301.078s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: with what you bring in in tuition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3653.565s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just wanted to ask, so usually when something's too good to be true, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3657.646s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So with Lexia letting us use it for free, does that mean in June we have to budget for $500,000 for this program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3707.372s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then what's dibbles per student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3723.959s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: »» Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3724.62s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So they are screeners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3737.0s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So are we looking at them together then, or are we looking at them separately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3763.256s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So does DIBL and MAP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3765.586s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: and Rapid sell an intervention program like Lexia does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3775.61s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just wondering, are we choosing it because it's free, or are we choosing it because it's the best option for the screeners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3808.026s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I guess if the trial is for the year, and hopefully we learn which kids need the intervention, and then we will be looking then to use their intervention, the core five, then we do have to budget for $40 a student per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3824.69s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: for this program if this is what we use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3850.049s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right, and I guess, I'm sorry I'm being cynical, and I owe that to Paul, because he says there's big money in education, and he's right, because he made me read a book about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3860.619s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I guess I'm just doubtful that, what is, is Lexia, is this really the best option out there, or do they market themselves so well, and give it to people for a year for free, that we end up thinking it's the best and we use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3906.594s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I'm not even being cynical just with the state of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3908.695s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm being cynical with the Department of Ed of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3954.278s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then with the core five for the intervention,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3957.273s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is that, would that bring on more staff, or you are saying the classroom teacher would be the interventionist using the core five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3963.196s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3969.36s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3970.58s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6543.809s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: My question was similar to Paul's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6545.89s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we just take their word from their RFP that they pay their employees a living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6551.946s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: A fair living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6553.086s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They don't say we pay our employees minimum wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6583.629s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could they look at it again to make sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6592.396s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So when future RFPs for cleaning, can we put in the language that they use for contractor RFPs that we make sure that there is a living wage included in the RFP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.068s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.368s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I know you didn't ask, so you wouldn't have the answer, but moving forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6671.065s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right, but it sounds like we didn't ask that question in the current RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6673.686s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6674.527s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Moving forward, can we put in the RFP that you provide whether it's a minimum wage or a living wage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6681.724s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I mean, on a daily basis, we hear about how the cost of living in the city of Medford, no one can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6688.149s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it seems like we should be doing our part to have people who are working in our schools be able to have a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6694.934s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'll get off my soapbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2302.944s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2303.304s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was going to ask if Member Van der Kloot would amend her motion to send it to the policy subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2310.572s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2310.992s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could I make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3080.814s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I will not read the report and hope I can't do the highlights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3085.055s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Our agenda, five items that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3088.716s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The first was speed bumps at the high school complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3093.117s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I have emailed the chief of police and John Laughlin, our building manager, facilities manager, and they are looking into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3102.84s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Second was the flashing speed signs that you see throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3111.88s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: telling us what speed we're going, if it is below the speed limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3115.462s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Those are all being used throughout the city, but when one frees up, it will go to the high school complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3123.407s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The third was an update on the Andrew Glenn complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3126.869s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: As of today, the sidewalks and curbing has been completed, and there's just some detailing work that needs to be finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3135.976s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Number four was regarding the school kitchen appliances, and that really stemmed from the desire to not use styrofoam plates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3146.905s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Rhetta Smith, the school nutritionist, did take an inventory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3150.348s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We do have many appliances throughout the school kitchens that need updating or repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3158.355s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: led us to a conversation with Alicia Hunt, who's the energy coordinator for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3162.297s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kathy Kreatz and I will be meeting with her and some state officials to discuss possible grant applications to update our school kitchen appliances and other ways to be green in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3179.009s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The last item of our agenda was the Medford High School master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3183.372s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And Mr. Brown, a teacher at the vocational high school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3187.932s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: gave us a report from his perspective as both a teacher and a citizen, and what is the plan for Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3197.38s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: His questions really led us to discuss, is it about rehabbing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3204.646s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is it about looking for funding to build new?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3208.349s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is it about doing it in phases?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3212.552s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And Kathy Kreatz had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3214.781s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: suggested that we make a subcommittee that would almost be a master vision plan for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3221.964s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I would like to make a motion to create a subcommittee on a master vision for the high school repair and maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3236.511s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.173s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.813s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3720.712s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: To clarify, I think it evolved from our typical subcommittee, our eight subcommittees, to now more of a committee like the superintendent search where community members are involved, teachers are involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3734.338s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It won't be three of the standing school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3737.74s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4502.56s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was wondering, and I'm not sure if it's Kathy or you folks that can answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4505.641s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So your slide says 770 kids on an IEP, but then our hard copy is 888.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4510.503s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4516.72s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But to increase by 118, is that an average for the beginning and the end of a school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4574.241s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I guess my concern or question, thinking of budgeting, is do you see a higher than average increase in the last few years of kids on IEPs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5502.537s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5503.377s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just want to share a conversation I had with one of my children's teachers at the Roberts because the assessment was on our last agenda that we were just talking about what the report was about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5516.0s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Like, what was the backstory?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5518.061s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We wanted to know about all the assessments taking place, how much instruction time is lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5522.362s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What I didn't know, which I thought is helpful for parents to know, is that at least for the math benchmarks, the student takes it on their Chromebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5531.823s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The results of the test or the benchmark are all downloaded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5536.044s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Then the math coach at the Roberts receives it all and can see where the needs are and what's missing or what needs to be highlighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5543.226s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then the math coach met with the teacher to review<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5546.313s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So at least I can only speak about math because I only had 10 minutes, you know, at drop-off to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5552.437s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I do think, I guess I never thought assessments went anywhere except they filled them out and they were filed somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5558.421s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But the math coach is at least looking at the math part, so that is direct service to see how they can help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2503.372s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Skorka, do you, I mean, I feel like I see you at a lot of events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2509.68s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What would be the idea?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2510.621s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would it be a full-time job to be the director of this program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2531.77s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2532.89s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: A year, it would be horrible if we let this go, and a year if there's no funding from Cummings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5781.871s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: A little light that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5784.272s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I had spoken to the chief of police last Friday because parents at the Roberts had just talked to me while I was at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5792.455s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And when I spoke to him on Friday, he said the man was in custody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5798.157s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: He was being held until today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5799.918s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And today he was being arraigned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5802.039s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I do not have an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5804.0s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the chief<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5805.439s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: thought he could possibly get a 30 or a 60-day psych evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5811.164s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So hopefully, there'll be an email when I get home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5813.225s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But the police are very on top of it and want to make sure the Roberts parents know that they are following it very closely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6141.666s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We only have three roles, really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6143.767s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's to set policy, oversee the budget, and to hire and supervise a superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6148.809s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think this needs to be discussed with all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5884.761s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: First of all, we're not a school choice program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5887.723s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Your predecessors say last year that we're a school choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5890.664s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No elementary schools you get to choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5893.146s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You go by where they tell you live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5895.527s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We've never followed school choice as it's really the definition of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5899.889s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I understand we need to make sure it's rolled out well, but this needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5905.132s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's been a long time, and I'm tired of the schools going back and forth depending on personnel issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5910.678s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If we have equal number of kids at both schools, it shouldn't matter about who the administration is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5915.721s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's about the kids in the classroom who make the culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5917.842s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6238.47s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are you seconding Erin's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6340.605s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah, like a projection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6341.425s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: A projection of how it would roll out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2356.043s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Linda, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but do you want to just say a few words so the community knows what your reading partners do with our students, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2364.653s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Lender is the reading coordinator for Mystic Valley Elder Services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4704.352s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I have a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4706.09s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can you just explain to me how the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts all have taken the access test in 2017 and 2018, but not the Brooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4724.079s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you know the number that you need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4754.452s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It was 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4755.353s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It was 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4801.483s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the Roberts has the newcomers for third, fourth, and fifth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4808.865s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And to place out of newcomers, they take the access test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4815.686s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4816.967s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then how do the children at the Columbus and the McGlynn take the access test?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4823.128s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They cannot be in the newcomers class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4831.663s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, so there's English learners in the Columbus and the McGlynn, but not newcomers programs, that are a significant amount of students that they can take the, they have the data to give you a MET target or a C target, but there's not the number at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4848.946s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That is English language learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4883.175s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And because it's percents, I don't know the number of actual students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4886.238s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So do you know, do the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4890.243s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: pretty similar numbers of students who take the access test?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5051.403s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can you tell us how many EL teachers you have at each of the four elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5073.728s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: going or what I'm wondering is if the Roberts, the McGlynn, and the Columbus have more teachers, more resources, do children who are in the neighborhood of Brooks not go to the Brooks because there's more EL teachers at the Roberts, the Columbus, and the McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5105.719s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5106.9s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So do you know, though, how many EL teachers are at each elementary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5164.877s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5194.144s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5194.525s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5199.896s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5200.257s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5201.019s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5201.44s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5411.159s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry, those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5412.88s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And what was the prior number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5457.406s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Any questions on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5468.735s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5518.436s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5896.184s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For grade 10, there's 104 males that were screened and 114 females.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5903.529s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think the grade 10 class is more around the 300 number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5907.791s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So was it optional if the kids were screened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5910.433s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Some students and some families do opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5913.714s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5915.535s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So would you say you had 100 students opt out, or is it just a sampling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5942.249s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I'm just wondering, would people who are suffering with obesity opt out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5947.833s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would the numbers be worse?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6735.137s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: When you say you had to replace 10 feet of pipes, is it a plumbing subcontractor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6743.021s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could you ask, so we are not playing catch up with classrooms every winter, what would the cost be to replace?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6762.354s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But at least we have a number to start with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6764.555s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because it's every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6765.795s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I mean, this is only my third year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6767.176s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And every year, parents talk about whether their kids are freezing or too hot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6771.818s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So why don't we just bite the bullet somehow in planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6774.339s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: At least if we have a number, we know what we're aiming for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6781.182s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I can't wait to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2264.443s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could I ask, would it have been possible, or is it too late, that could a police officer have been assigned to this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2285.005s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2287.707s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2288.127s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2386.844s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Nitty gritty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2387.907s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I think because I was surprised when I saw it on the agenda, and we haven't really had a conversation about it since maybe May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2395.451s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2395.872s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah, May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2397.492s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And it probably just fell off my radar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2399.614s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could it be a possible one-year contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2402.395s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I mean, just thinking of personnel and how often we talk about the budget and the cost of personnel and the cost of every union, and just to add another person on, whereas<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2414.738s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think I'd rather a position for more math coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2419.285s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I understand it's split between the city and the school, but could it be a one-year job to see if they're just implementing what we get from Safe Havens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2426.777s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's kind of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2446.032s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2473.4s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5068.537s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5068.717s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5070.118s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5071.079s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And you had mentioned deer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5073.184s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: program and when Jasper just mentioned his brother in fifth grade which that's when we have it do you know is there a new curriculum that is being worked on that's updated with these new concerns for dear you don't know I didn't know in your work if you've come across any discussion about it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5187.484s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think Michael, did you turn off the projector?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5189.165s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know, do they want it on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2556.684s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I will try to bring the highlights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2558.285s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We did have a follow-up buildings and grounds subcommittee meeting on November 29th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2562.088s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It was a follow-up from our meeting last May to hear about updates in security and safety at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2571.195s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So present were four school committee members, the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2575.897s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: two parents of both elementary and high school age students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2580.298s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We had three Medford police officers, Lieutenant Covino, Officer Ziobro, and Officer Lokowitz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2586.86s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The director of buildings and grounds was in attendance, director of nursing, the high school principal, and the assistant superintendent, Miss Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2594.483s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we had a good representation of everyone at the high school building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2600.144s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: First item that Officer Ziobro shared with us is that he does attend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2605.563s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: monthly meetings with the community-based justice coalition with the assistant district attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2614.185s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The director of nursing, Toni Wray, also attends, and it's to address high-level risk situations and highly troubled students that they are paying attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2627.639s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Second was the safe haven report at that time was not released to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2634.184s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It was understood that it is a Department of Homeland Security document and it is a privileged document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2641.283s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Parts that can be shared will be shared when it is available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2646.108s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Third was all the cameras have been fixed or are currently being fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2651.212s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So all the cameras in all of the school buildings are fixed or are on a list to be fixed happening currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2658.438s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Next, oh, some question was asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2660.46s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There are 95 cameras on the high school campus, and it is privileged information where they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2668.133s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The other concern parents had was the doors being marked from the outside of the school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2674.376s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Currently, there are doors that were unmarked that are now being marked by Mr. McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2684.942s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The next highlight was that Mr. DeLava shared that on November 6, there was a training about safety care for kids in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2692.305s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: He wanted to thank the Medford Police Department for their continuing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2695.875s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: training and building relationships with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2700.117s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. DeLeva also shared that dogs from area police departments and the state police came to do some training in the building, both for drugs and ballistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2711.901s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We did learn that different dogs are trained for specific sins, differing between drug paraphernalia and ballistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2723.23s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We did, after the safety update, we did discuss the feminine hygiene products being installed in the high school, and that will be in a follow-up report with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2732.28s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Diane Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2734.022s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know if my fellow members, Erin and, I mean, Committee Member DiVenedetto and Committee Member Kreatz are both on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2741.887s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: buildings and grout subcommittee and committee member Van der Kloot was in attendance and that is all I have to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3017.779s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3019.78s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The only thing I could think of is maybe it's possible that because of toxic shock syndrome, that it's not something that the school feels comfortable, because then you'd be liable, God forbid,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3029.48s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: someone came with toxic shock syndrome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3169.207s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Jonathan just shared that the current dispensers have dual capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3173.849s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if the time comes that you need to dispense dual products, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6706.182s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'll get it later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6709.743s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just to make sure, we will have these books for September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6719.979s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6720.26s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great, so full rollout September 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6723.481s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6724.721s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6724.962s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6747.617s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just rereading my notes, I made an oversight at our Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6751.979s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Officer Bill Mazzacca was present, and I do feel remiss if I don't say that I appreciate his input at that meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6916.046s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Any of the 14 school districts that were funded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6918.967s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The 12 will be listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6922.187s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3142.519s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Frello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3142.959s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3143.619s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So will middle schoolers be, so right in two years I'll have a sophomore, freshman, and seventh grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3148.98s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Will middle schoolers be open to the triple?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3151.301s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Will you keep it to strictly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3179.015s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then just in regards to looking two years out, so will you somehow try to reach out to current<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3187.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 5th and 6th graders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6330.489s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I appreciate you wanting parents to get here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6332.69s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'd love to see parents here often, but like most of us, we do also have kids with bedtimes and feeding dinner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6341.466s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We have eight subcommittees that I think if a parent has a real concern about an issue, we've all been emailed on that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6349.993s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And most of the time, if it's an issue that a number of parents are concerned with, it does get addressed at a subcommittee, whether it's buildings and grounds, community relations, curriculum, special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6359.862s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if we only book this twice a year, the concern that might bring a parent out might not even be on the agenda for those two meetings a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6368.189s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm not sure if this would really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6370.508s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: get parents here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6371.729s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think a meeting open to parents, like the community relations where parents have an actual concern about relations, they can come to the subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6382.035s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Or if it's a concern about class size, we can bring it to curriculum and talk to the parents who are very concerned and make a time for them that works for them to get there, whether it's at 4 o'clock on a Wednesday or, you know, 7 o'clock on a Thursday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6397.245s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just, having two meetings a year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6400.66s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That doesn't mean their issue is going to fall on the agenda for those two meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6411.888s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6455.622s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: whether it's going to the high school for TLC with Mr. DeLava or doing a walk audit on Salem Street for parents at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6461.865s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know everyone here has done projects specific to parents who've reached out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6466.527s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I haven't heard from parents saying that they haven't been heard or there's an issue that they would have come if it wasn't on a Monday night at 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6474.31s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Maybe it's different parent group than I'm speaking with than you are speaking with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6479.192s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I haven't yet heard a parent say, Mia,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6481.708s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We need a meeting on a Saturday because the school committee is not hearing us or not addressing something that we've brought to your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6519.705s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah, I think we'll agree to disagree, at least on my side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=530.799s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Russo, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=438.273s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So today at 4 o'clock we have a Building and Grounds Committee regarding the playground at the Roberts, the surface of the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=446.1s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aaron DiVenedetto, Kathy Kreatz, and myself are on the building and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=449.981s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I am the chair, so I'm not speaking as the chair tonight of the school committee, but right now as the chair of the buildings and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=456.424s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Unfortunately, we were notified last week that the interlocking bricks that we were using for the playground surface are no longer being produced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=466.167s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The man who was the rep from the playground company came to our meeting today, and he explained that a surface in another part of the country<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=475.911s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: had the bricks in for only a year and a half and they were cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=479.192s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it had to do with the UA, some fancy chemical word, UV, and that they halted production.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=488.114s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Christine, please feel free to stay up because I'm sure I'll forget some of the other words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=492.636s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that he came to give us other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=494.796s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So when the original options were presented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=498.018s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: when Cheryl Rodriguez did the research, it was these interlocking breaks, a poor in place surface, or a rubber bond surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=507.765s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So from the meeting, we heard from Travis, the playground rep, and from other peoples in the community, a woman who's a member, Roberta Cameron, from the Community Preservation Committee was there to make sure that the grant and its language would be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=524.474s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: still, the grant money could still be used for a rubber bond surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=529.618s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kathy, Erin, and I voted to move forward because the CPC will still fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=537.004s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The one issue that we have to address this week that our assistant superintendent, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=545.35s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So this is what I don't understand at all that much if you want to add on from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=549.754s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=745.556s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We can vote again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=883.916s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the motion was by Erin, seconded by Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3472.449s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3473.81s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I did see two of my girls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3475.651s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I saw their Darth Vader and Penguin socks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3648.019s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3648.439s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: School committee member Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3983.039s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are you looking where it's Robert's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4076.21s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: While you're here and while we're all in the same room, I do want to bring up our city engineer, Todd Ellery, who's a very active parent at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4083.014s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sarah as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4084.435s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just because I know for one of the goals for the Roberts, it says to apply for the infrastructure assessment grant from the DOT when the application comes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4093.841s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if I know that Sarah Ellery, myself, had walked around with Sergeant Harnett around the Roberts to look at all the ways that it could be improved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4102.226s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then the second time we went out with the city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4104.407s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The first time was just the policeman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4106.13s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So can you guys come up just so you can talk a little bit about, I think part of the reason not many kids walk to the Roberts is because of the fouls way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4118.635s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Well, you've been working on it for a long time, Mallory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4121.736s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Todd's just got here last year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4123.216s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you want to go first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4391.425s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4597.335s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I would like a motion to approve the mass use of safe routes to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4604.118s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4606.059s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5855.48s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5857.741s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thanks for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5859.022s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: To help you recruit, what is the hourly rate for the different positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7919.35s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7919.67s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So last year we piloted McGraw-Hill and FOSS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7923.432s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I heard back that all the teachers thought McGraw-Hill was not a good program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7928.214s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That left us with only FOSS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7930.115s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm not sure why we still are discussing, if we are doing it, shouldn't we just make a motion to buy it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7937.585s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: and get the training on the calendar for teachers so they're ready in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7941.15s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I mean, we've been having a science conversation for two and a half years now, for the two and a half years I've been on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7946.777s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So to delay it again, I'm losing my patience with science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7951.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the MCAS test will show it tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7982.219s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I mean I was shocked to go to my parent-teacher meeting and to hear that my fourth grader was doing McGraw-Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7988.005s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because I thought last year we decided everyone was going to do Foss because everyone had said McGraw-Hill was terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7993.892s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm sorry if I seem impatient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7998.598s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But it seems like Floss was the one that all the teachers said was worth investing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8800.026s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8800.187s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8801.547s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8802.348s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Colwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8802.868s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm trying to look at the enrollment chart for the elementary and the day of attendance for the elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8812.514s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the day of attendance was 9-6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8813.855s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8815.596s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are you looking at the... So it just has one top says elementary attendance, 9-6-18, and one has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8825.5s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: elementary enrollment, 9, 26, 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8828.743s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So enrollment is the ones that are registered in Parent Information Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8833.546s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The attendance is just from School Brains that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8840.632s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8841.032s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the only thing that struck me was for the day of attendance, the Brooks had three absent out of 544.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8849.639s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The Columbus had 11 absent out of 406.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8855.025s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The McGlynn had 20 absent out of 478, and the Roberts had 9 absent out of 563.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8861.188s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I didn't do the percentage yet, but just after hearing that report about chronic absenteeism, the 20 at the McGlynn did strike me to have 20 absent in one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8872.032s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is that something that is noted on school brains when a school has a higher percentage of absenteeism one day as opposed to another?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8901.445s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=49.369s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2860.788s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2862.929s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: By the list of the documents you're going to review, you have your work cut out for you, and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2868.273s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I did want to just add one thing that had been an ongoing conversation for the last two years was the maintenance and upkeep and renovation of many of our school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2877.88s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if maybe on that list you could just have Mr. McLaughlin give you an update of what really needs to be done, like Member van der Kloot said about the compresses, 15,000 for our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2891.298s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 30, I think, was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2892.658s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: How many in total?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2893.779s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right, 15,000, but we need 30 of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2896.359s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: How many?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2898.84s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2899.24s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's just the only other thing that I know that we've had conversations about many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4860.76s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It has not been read yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=542.877s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can I make a motion for the suspension of the rules today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=546.399s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's out of order for item 11, negotiations, item 1, the report of opening of schools, and item 6, the report on buildings and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4881.257s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4883.543s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: unclear of the two different processes that are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4888.286s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Cheryl, do you mind coming up again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4890.407s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4891.948s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think there was just so much information that was just given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4898.391s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I feel like I just learned how to be a procurement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4905.228s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: you had said you had a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4907.13s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So can you walk it through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4908.932s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The landscaping is one thing with removal and disposal and the purchase of the playground blocks, interlocking blocks is a different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4921.408s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, that was always the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4923.53s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So what would you, I'm saying if you, if you say this is right, what would you have us like, how would it start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4955.932s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the RFP, there still needs to be an RFP because it's over $50,000 in product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4961.516s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4967.64s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We don't need an RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4969.221s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that person is a state contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4971.382s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4972.223s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4972.623s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4994.812s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is the groundmaster still an option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5026.137s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So what the two estimates that came in at 223 and 224?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5031.13s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That was not including what Groundmasters was already doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5034.091s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, that was the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5039.313s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, so that was never part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5041.194s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Groundmasters was always on board, that was always the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5086.303s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, so that seems absurd, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5101.873s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if the $90,000 for this company, Rubble, what was it called?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5107.317s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That does not include some underlying, but ground masters can't do that either?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5117.985s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I know ground masters is removal and disposal and we have the product, but then there's some intermediate sod you need or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5128.357s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So can either ground masters do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7094.774s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Tomorrow night is the football opening game against Lynn Classical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7100.419s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The marching band will be performing halftime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7107.014s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if everyone wants to come out and support Medford football.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7110.015s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's at seven o'clock, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7111.396s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They switched, this year the football games start at six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7114.097s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7114.757s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They used to be seven, now they're six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7423.818s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For the Andrews, Teagan and Colin brought home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7428.193s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: piece of paper this size already filled out with my information and Tim's information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7432.154s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And it's just that if there are changes, change it and sign it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7436.315s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Nevin, Rowan, and Declan, you're right, I had to fill out the same paper three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7443.056s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know how the Andrews, if the Andrews School is just more familiar with the School Brains software that they just printed out and sent it home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7452.51s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know if Mr. DeLeva remembers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7457.195s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7457.736s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Well, do the high school kids get a piece of paper already with the information on it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7488.338s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the high school, do you print it out and send it home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7505.225s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Not at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7506.066s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know about the Columbus, or the McGlynn, or the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7509.247s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Did you have to fill out paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7510.608s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: At the Columbus, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7524.475s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But if it is a school brain's capability, it was nice to have Tegan and Cullen just say, mom, just check this, and me say it's all the same and pass it back in, then filling out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7537.502s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: To see how Mr. Downs did it, or Mr. DeLeva did it before he left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9049.473s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9050.794s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9052.535s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just want to inform the Roberts parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9055.337s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the number one bus at the Roberts is overcrowded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9058.758s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Unfortunately with the kindergarten added on today, there was a very overloaded bus that three of my own children ward, but Christine is working with Tatiana from the bus company and Mr. O'Brien, the Roberts vice principals working as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9071.902s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that will be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9072.903s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So for parents who are concerned, it is being worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9075.944s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9076.344s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And by next Monday, it should be evened out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9078.486s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9178.794s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can you just talk about safety?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9181.256s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I noticed that recently a crossing was hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9185.491s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: and it was school dismissal time, and I do think that I... Not at Medford, sorry, not at Medford, another city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9194.513s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But even up with us on Highland Ave, and on our intersection of Highland Ave and Sturges, a number of times the bus will be stopped, he'll have the stop sign, and cars will pass while kids are getting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9246.713s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I know in the past that this has come up, not at your intersection, and that the DPW has gone and removed mounds of snow from a bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9254.36s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if you give us the heads up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9291.366s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And even in the past, parents have had,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9294.703s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: parents who have had concern, the police has sent someone for a few days, because a lot of times it's a regular commuter that is passing the bus, and the police presence has slowed people down to respect the bus rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9309.573s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So maybe that's another, maybe the police department could look at Hadley Place in Salem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10002.409s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just want to suggest that maybe we could even think about budgeting buying the supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10006.631s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So a friend of mine works in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10009.68s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: the school department buys the supply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10012.342s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: She did look it up while she was over at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10014.224s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's 40,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10015.365s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They have a much smaller school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10017.846s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But if we were to average $50 a student, it'd be $200,000 more or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10024.612s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, I mean, that is another goal that we could have because it is, I mean, I spent over $200 for the kids going to Staples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10034.079s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, I mean, if we want to go beyond just trying to get a break on it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10039.123s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Why don't we put it into our school budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10043.525s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10043.866s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Potentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10044.546s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=477.835s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the parents were reimbursed for the lost iPhone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4368.597s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You had just read the six languages, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4374.122s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are there any other language that is taught at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4395.757s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You don't teach Latin at high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4398.799s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So what are the three languages, again, that are taught at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4401.535s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Spanish, Italian, and French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4403.396s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4775.674s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4776.974s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For the 36 students who took AP,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4781.338s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 12, 12, and 12, so Spanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6503.761s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The scenario where someone would start at the Brooks, then go to the Roberts, and then go to the neighborhood school, do we actually do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6509.344s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because I've been at the Roberts, and it was my understanding that if the child started at the Roberts in third and newcomers, they did stay through for fourth and fifth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6519.529s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6520.009s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That I did not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6521.23s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So how many would you say students a year leave the Brooks or the Roberts to go back to their neighborhood school from the newcomers program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6603.95s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: that I know were in other school districts' neighborhoods, they've all stayed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6607.872s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And granted, that's maybe going back a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6610.354s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm thinking of certain friends of some of my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6613.396s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if it was a parent's request to stay at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6616.297s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know if there's a back story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6618.019s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you know, Mr. Bosco?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6770.24s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because I think this is a conversation that we're having a lot with parents at different schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6776.024s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So there are currently five teachers at the McGlynn Middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6780.267s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Two for newcomers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6781.447s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6783.329s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, so two for newcomers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6813.739s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is it possible that two teachers would stay at the book lab?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6816.961s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One would have newcomers grades six, seven, and eight, and one would have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6878.41s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if we just, so I can have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6882.012s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: answers to parents' questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6883.513s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If we duplicated the same exact middle school model at the Andrews, you would need four, you'd have to keep four at the McGlenn, and you'd need four at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6908.558s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: but then we would run into moving the kids from the Andrews back to the McLintock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6912.339s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So how many teachers would you need if you needed newcomers at both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6916.66s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would it then be seven?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6918.92s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Eight, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9845.517s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just so we all know how you did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9853.061s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, so you would do a percent of the number of fifth graders in each of the four elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11180.433s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: However, I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11188.055s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11837.623s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I hear you, but I think we get emails often from parents that you've referenced tonight, the after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11844.128s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I almost feel like Paul's taking the weight off my own shoulders by saying it's not something we want to do, because I do get texts regularly from friends who are also parents in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11856.937s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think we've gotten a number of emails that all of us have shared here that if parents have a concern or a resident, we can bring it and say, we got this email from this person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11865.984s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11867.499s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Paul's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11871.142s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry, Paulette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11872.843s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, she thirds it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11960.516s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I mean, they can email us the next day and we can bring it up at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11967.878s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's not honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11968.699s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It doesn't feel honest to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11970.139s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I am totally guilty of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11972.52s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For the past two years, people have texted me and I've brought up issues that people have texted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11976.622s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And it felt yucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11978.102s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I never even thought of going this route with Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11980.764s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I respect him for addressing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4368.57s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You had just read the six languages, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6878.393s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if we just, so I can have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6881.995s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: answers to parents' questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6883.476s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If we duplicated the same exact middle school model at the Andrews, you would need four, you'd have to keep four at the McGlenn and you'd need four at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6908.544s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: but then we would run into moving the kids from the Andrews back to McClint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6911.306s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So how many teachers would you need if you needed newcomers at both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6916.651s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would it then be seven?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6918.913s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Eight, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9853.023s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, so you would do a percent of the number of fifth graders in each of the four elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11197.868s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No one came forward by Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11209.391s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: On the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11837.606s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I hear you, but I think we get emails often from parents that you've referenced tonight, the after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11844.11s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I almost feel like Paul's taking the weight off my own shoulders by saying it's not something we want to do because I do get texts regularly from friends who are also parents in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11856.918s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I think we've gotten a number of emails that all of us have shared here that if parents have a concern or a resident, we can bring it and say, we got this email from this person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11865.964s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11867.485s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Paul's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11871.108s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry, Paulette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11871.868s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I third Paul's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11872.809s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, she thirds it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11960.496s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I mean, they can email us the next day, and we can bring it up at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11967.859s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's not honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11968.68s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It doesn't feel honest to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11970.121s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I am totally guilty of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11972.502s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For the past two years, people have texted me, and I've brought up issues that people have texted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11976.604s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And it felt yucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11978.085s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I never even thought of going this route with Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11980.746s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I respect him for addressing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6311.842s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know about everyone, but likewise, I thought someone who was in administration was going to step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6317.439s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: not realizing that's not in their contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6319.92s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So when we did receive multiple angry emails that night and the next morning, I did respond saying, I went in assuming, shame on me, that someone in administration would step into that role per contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6332.726s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The other option was that the Massachusetts Association School Committees can take someone almost like an emergency superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6339.99s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So to me, having a middle man or middle woman come in for eight weeks, try to transition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6345.968s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: while we have, I almost feel like Dr. Maurice is like the Phoenix out of the ashes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6350.451s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Like this is going to be a whole new public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6354.873s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I did not think that was the best choice to have a middle person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6359.116s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, but I think Mr. Bellson is, has the knowledge and the history to give our new superintendent and just looking forward that we needed that transition to be smoothly done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6371.363s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6372.938s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know people don't agree with that, but I think it would have been more detrimental to our school system to bring someone in for eight weeks, and I stand by that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8300.12s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just want to say, a parent did email the next day and say, you definitely need to put in the new deputy superintendent's contract that they will step in so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8311.467s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We have to add that because that isn't currently in the contract, so that doesn't work, which I was, it's a shame on me that I didn't read their contract to know that they did not have to be asked or forced into taking that superintendent's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8328.62s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's, we can add that to make sure the next deputy superintendent is their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9254.5s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9751.823s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Back in January, when our meeting was in the media studio,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9756.619s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the McGlynn teachers spoke about their improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9761.862s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Someone mentioned almost, I don't want to call it gifted and talented because that's not what they called it, but it was, does this sound familiar to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9771.287s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And they were saying that could be a way to attract that if you spoke to the four elementary school principals and said maybe you could, kids who want to be pushed more, or kids whose parents want to push them more, maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9784.017s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: it was talked about having a program at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9786.718s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Does that sound familiar to anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9791.421s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, this wasn't a club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9792.461s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: This was a curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9796.383s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They would be tracked, more or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10052.265s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: More suggestion or just to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10055.487s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if we did move half the ELL students to the Andrews, the numbers would be equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10110.027s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So with the Roberts, we had the program grades one through five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10113.889s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You had the newcomers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10114.83s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And for a few years, we were maxed on physical space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10118.912s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So this year, grades one and two went to the Brooks, Roberts retained three, four, and five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10123.935s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I haven't heard much feedback one way or the other, but it freed up physical space in our building at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10134.783s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: just thinking of the 50 families, well, or 29, who end up not getting what they desired in our school choice, and if you, the Andrews used to have an ELL program, and we had the staffing for it, maybe that's a way to, and Justin, I guess Justin is what made me think of it, is that you don't want the McGlynn to be almost stigmatized, and if the Andrews has it as well, then we're helping there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10169.455s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10190.62s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know, but we're going to get our hands dirty one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10193.242s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Either we're going to have 29 really angry families, or we're going to be dirty our hands with staffing with ELL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10284.394s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, I understand if we have to hire four additional teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10592.36s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: suggested that Mr. Tucci is debating on whether he would like to stay as principal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10606.711s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But it's not like you said, by Friday, so we can tell the public that the McGlynn will have a principal in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10611.494s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10630.53s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13597.702s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is the plan that they would co-teach with Mr. McGlenn at the Roberts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13603.942s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: or would they go in and tell Mr. McGlynn or share ideas with Mr. McGlynn and travel the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13591.557s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think I've never even heard of an adaptive physical education teacher, so that seems very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13597.659s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is the plan that they would co-teach with Mr. McGlynn at the Roberts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13603.761s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13604.041s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would they go in and tell Mr. McGlynn or share ideas with Mr. McGlynn and travel the schools or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5345.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was like a mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5354.998s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I would say over the last two and a half years, the most, the highest concern I hear from parents is the maintenance and upkeep of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5363.141s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that we almost need to do an inventory of all our buildings and a plan for keeping up on top of the schools every year that we still call them new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5374.164s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: This is really the new high school question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5376.825s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think it would be great to have, you know, every year we do the same checklist that every building needs to stay on top of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1.145s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Please forgive me if I stumble on some motions or the verbiage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5.769s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Rousseau did try to get me a cheat sheet of Robert's Rules of Rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9.231s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We couldn't find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=12.114s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, let's stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=33.172s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So first is the approval of minutes of the March 19, 2018 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=41.178s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Attendance first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=68.518s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: which is the item number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=70.441s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Approval of minutes of March 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=73.405s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=164.096s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Motion for approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=329.832s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=452.052s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, now report on March vouchers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=586.863s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=587.123s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: van de Kloot and then Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=673.888s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Ruseaul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=682.192s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Has the prep table arrived?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=683.313s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=686.448s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Any other questions on the Secretary's report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=690.689s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: A motion to accept?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=696.851s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: A roll call vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=711.328s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Next on the agenda is the buildings and grounds subcommittee report, which I am the chair of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=716.392s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So in the interest of time, because we were delayed starting this meeting, we had a committee of the whole meeting before this about the superintendent search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=724.838s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I am going to briefly talk about some highlights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=727.199s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We did have a very productive meeting with 23 people at attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=731.542s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They were principals, administrators, parents, school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=735.752s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Once we vote on this, this will be online so you can read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=739.377s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It does include highlights that every principal of every school had sent to me of what they've done since that February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=748.891s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: meeting asking for some updates to security that had been questioned and then some proposals or suggestions that people gave to us that we are looking into now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=762.886s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One is that to re-evaluate the STARS program, Alice has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=770.393s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: looked into and we're still moving forward in seeing how ALICE works in the school system with professional development and the cost, but also was suggested by the teacher union president to re-evaluate STARS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=783.941s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Number two, someone talked about in our schools, the doors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=789.383s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: can only be opened on one side, so they sell these magnetic strips that are $3.25 that you would put on the classroom door, so that your door, you can go in and out, except when, unfortunately, if there was a time that we would have to have a lockdown, the magnetic strip would come off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=804.166s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the teacher wouldn't have to unlock the door from one side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=807.287s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't understand it unless I have to get out and see the classroom door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=811.668s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Three was additional adjustment Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=814.409s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Four was a safety committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=816.649s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: and each school, not just a district-wide safety committee, but each school because they are such different physical plants and they have their own concerns that each school should have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=827.373s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Five was classroom keys in the main office for substitutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=832.095s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That is a concern that I don't know if it was a teacher or a principal had brought to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=837.27s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: that if a substitute is in, if there was a lockdown situation, they wouldn't have the keys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=844.935s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Number six was number on all the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=848.038s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if the fire department is called, all the doors, both internally and externally, would be numbered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=854.302s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if the teacher's on the inside and is down one hallway, they can say what door they're at, and that same exit door would be on the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=862.848s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Number 7 would be additional method police officers assigned to schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=867.309s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 8 was additional social and emotional training for all staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=871.55s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 9 was additional walkie-talkies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=874.051s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 10 was keyless entry for staff and faculty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=877.572s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What it was described to me was almost a tap card and that would be to end the main<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=884.854s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: building the front doors itself because right now custodians are the ones who let teachers in who arrive early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=891.676s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It could be for hallways, it could be for classrooms, so tap cards I think is the more casual language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=898.257s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 11 is security training for both the before school staff and the after school staff and the early childhood staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=905.699s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 12 was to have a standing security concern agenda item on the buildings and grounds subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=914.381s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 13 was information for new students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=917.002s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: This was brought by a city employee that said if a student, if we do drills, say in the fall, and a student transfers to our school mid-year, to have, to make sure that new orientation for students, that they're up to date with what their safety protocol would be at their school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=937.372s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Number 14 is emergency kits for lockdown situations that teachers would have in their classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=944.397s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And 15 was to make sure suggestions for children who have an IEP that services they would need during a lockdown is included on their IEP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=956.386s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If you have any questions, please feel free<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=959.887s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: to email me, and this, after we discuss it, will be posted for, you can see what every school has been doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=967.094s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=967.274s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1122.467s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Vanderpool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1175.337s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1175.897s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1176.077s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1176.317s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1177.918s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So you'll be on as community member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1191.478s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1191.858s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1193.659s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1195.0s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero and then Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1246.873s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you Next on the agenda is oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1451.601s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1451.861s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But they've had, Mr. Kreatz, if I, if just so I can understand the history, if I went in for cosmetology or another service, I went into the Vogue front door,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1461.487s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And the secretary ran my license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1666.95s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is there a second for the motion to do a study to see how many people use the pool door during school hours, and maybe it'd be a better resource to use it at the rope door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1674.553s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Motion, second by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1676.274s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1679.035s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1685.197s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: To see if the pool door, if people are using it as frequently during the school hours as the people who are trying to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1693.77s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: in the vocational door for services of the different shops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1845.76s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So right now, I think it's allocating the resource of the pool door person and the vocation person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1850.861s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think that's the immediate need that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1853.382s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kreatz is hearing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1854.422s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I think that should be the report right now so we can get that moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1898.674s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we have a motion to find out the use of the both doors and allocate the resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1906.644s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1907.184s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Relative traffic patterns both in the interest of time, because I do know that we did still start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1913.111s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 20 minutes late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1913.671s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There are some amazing students here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1915.892s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Could someone have a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1917.373s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1923.195s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1923.615s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Van De Koop made a motion to take the agenda items out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1926.296s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we can go to the vote on it first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3381.055s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But on a different topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3412.172s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: How do I do that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3625.739s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I thank you for being here, and I know you said you looked into the Michigan model, because that is something that the school committee had adopted a few years back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3632.365s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Have you found any curriculums that are specific to social media bullying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3636.323s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3654.515s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Would you mind emailing us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3658.677s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So would you suggest each school set up their own committee for addressing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3665.023s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is it bullying all around or would you say you're really pinpointing social media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3773.628s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Was it under a subcommittee when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3775.957s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You did it in 2010 with Ann Marie?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3956.428s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We have Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3958.769s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: DiBenedetto, and Mr. Musso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4006.207s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And hopefully this, I think this issue is something that could be taken up on a subcommittee and that could be a suggestion that is flushed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4055.544s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4057.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: D. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4192.586s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Or a full committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4248.635s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So there's a motion to get the rates of these forms that are being, I don't know, where do the principals, do the principals send them somewhere once they fill them out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4403.31s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Something to do with music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4444.245s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we have, just to make the key points so far, so Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4450.427s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kreatz had suggested the phone line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4453.808s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sebastian suggested,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4456.036s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: looking at the policy again and updating it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4464.622s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4467.024s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Paul, Mr. Russo, did you have a suggestion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4478.513s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So just asking the principals how many forms they fill out a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4481.275s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4582.835s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4663.294s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So hold on Mr. Nelson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4665.515s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4764.531s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think when it trickles back into the school day, that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4803.728s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We do need a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4885.357s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Mr. Ruggiero made a motion to make this issue a committee of the whole for social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4892.322s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I think it's a wide net.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4894.484s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4938.806s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And if we try to... After the superintendent is hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4942.267s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7912.288s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Next, we have Tony Vento for the School Health Services Pre-Budget Report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7917.011s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: God bless you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8324.215s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Great, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8326.277s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8333.064s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8334.425s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8409.598s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I want to clarify your motion to get a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8445.881s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8453.602s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the motion is for the next agenda, which our meeting, our next meeting is May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8459.966s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8461.607s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8462.768s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: In May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8463.268s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: In May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8464.108s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We will put on the agenda transition plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8467.09s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8469.912s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8471.493s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8471.633s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8504.058s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So make a motion that if there is a police report that's finished, that it will be shared at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8578.204s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8581.292s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: for the May agenda to have a report, if there is one, or whatever update, there might be no update on the agenda for our May meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8589.495s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Who's to second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8591.256s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Russo seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8592.497s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8593.837s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8594.738s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Placed on five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8596.411s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So coming to the end is report on Metro Public Schools after school programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8601.914s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That was, I think we all received the same email that a mom rightfully concerned that the after school program is full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8609.479s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I looked quickly at the books and she wanted to see how the school committee could help improve the numbers or the capacity for after school programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8751.951s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero, I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8947.615s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8950.937s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8952.678s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8954.619s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8960.854s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, can we hold just for just condolences and congratulations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8992.416s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we will start with happy news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8994.617s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Congratulations to Denise Chiesa, the school committee executive assistant on the marriage of her daughter Alexandra to Arthur Turani this past weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9004.462s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9008.677s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And we do have two condolences, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Shirley Carr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9017.479s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mrs. Carr was a former account clerk at the vocational school and the wife of retired Medford Police Detective Patrick Carr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9024.601s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Also be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Robert Harrington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9031.338s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Harrington was a long time teacher at the Curtis Tough School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9034.864s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: If we could take a moment of silence for these two individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9063.754s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I have to make the announcement we are not going back out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9065.976s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=972.085s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So this is two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=973.366s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One is, what do you think is the primary function of a superintendent nowadays with so many shifting educational requirements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=982.75s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And how would you implement your first steps for this priority if you were to be our superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1077.511s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: First steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1078.212s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if you were to be superintendent, what do you think your first steps would be in the new role?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3823.844s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So another big concern of parents that I received emails is about the upkeep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3829.167s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: and maintenance of our school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3831.789s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So do you have experience with budget for upkeep and maintenance, or is that something that you see in your current BPS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3841.636s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is that something you've dealt with before with your schools that you are the superintendent of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3915.634s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is there a line budget item that says grounds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4005.961s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I know you've had many different roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4008.202s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Have you had in one of your roles the responsibility to write a whole school budget and what was that like for you or how did it play out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.206s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.786s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Well, I guess could I just follow up with that, just because you had mentioned community partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4109.328s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can you speak about partnerships that you've created or that you would like to see created in Medford that aren't currently here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7783.941s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7784.881s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Very good to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7786.722s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I guess my basic question is, what do you see as the primary role of the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7792.545s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then following that, how would you take, what would your first steps be if you were to be the next Medford superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7924.078s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=296.203s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I would say if you've googled Medford school system, you probably got a lot of articles about communication within the district with parents, with teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=306.11s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if you could talk about how you communicate with teachers, administrators, parents, and everyone, and children, and the students, that would be, I would love to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=315.917s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=483.77s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1878.223s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: preschool education, except that it seems like a lot of front lines of newspapers is that four-year-olds should have a universal full-day program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1887.09s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I know in Boston it's K1 and K2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1889.672s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know about North Andover or if it's something you're interested in, if you think it's something we could do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1894.856s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know parents have asked me quite often about a four-year-old program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1899.019s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So your thoughts, early childhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2019.877s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2020.657s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.738s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.918s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kritz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2023.078s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4151.896s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just have one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4153.316s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Another concern of many parents is the physical space in a capital plan for upkeep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4159.637s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So our elementary schools and our middle schools are still new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4164.038s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It's 13 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4166.959s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But have you worked with the capital plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4168.599s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: How do you address the building needs, the upkeep, the maintenance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4173.18s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's something that comes up often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4176.24s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: with our buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4310.879s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Were you part of the writing team for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4314.081s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Middle school application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4317.907s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6688.177s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6689.042s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Turn this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6690.783s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I did learn through your resume that you have middle school and high school experience, but we do have four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6696.869s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So if you could talk some concerns you have, both your strengths with elementary are tying it in, or concerns of now heading a school system K through 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6821.171s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can I follow up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6822.172s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6824.033s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So about early childhood, a lot of surrounding towns are talking about a four-year-old full day, calling it K1, pre-K, K2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6833.421s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if you have thoughts on that or if you see how that could work here in MedFed or if you've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6839.983s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: have a plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6866.603s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6867.203s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.744s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.945s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kritz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8534.2s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You had used the phrase you're an outsider with an insider view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8540.308s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So with that inside view, what would you say is the Medford Public Schools greatest strength and greatest weakness and how would you address the weakness?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8672.128s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just to follow up on that, I know that we've exchanged emails that I had met with the two community directors for Medford and Somerville, and that I was unaware that any student can audit a class that would be high school credit, not Tufts credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8686.095s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that the woman, Barbara Rugal, said she's had one most of the time, at most a year three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8692.579s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that is something that they are eager to get more partnership going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8697.161s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm not saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5111.453s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just want to share with people at home that the Medford Community Coalition had emailed the school committee and other members in central administration about suggestions they had for communication and safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5129.086s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I just want to clarify for them that one of their suggestions was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5134.478s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: to find out if a training was happening with Alice, what's hopefully the timeline so we can say hopefully a professional development day in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5143.68s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But this is just a short one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5145.38s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah, an intro is March 21st and then further on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5148.801s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Their other suggestion was about the safety advisory committee that we had spoken about that is going to fall under the building and grounds subcommittee, which I chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5157.962s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And we did set a date, thank God, for Doodle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5161.195s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So our safety advisory committee first meeting will be Thursday night, March 22nd from 7 to 9 at the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5169.902s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It will be posted tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5171.524s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Everyone is welcome to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5175.087s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then their other suggestion was just having streamlined communication, which is something that is being addressed and working on with central administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5184.234s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I want to thank the Method Community Coalition for giving us those great suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5196.256s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5196.656s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5241.789s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I can second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5242.47s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5528.55s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I guess we'll find out more once we go through training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5534.033s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But a friend of mine works in a different district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5536.923s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: She was only trained once for ALICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5540.525s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it's almost, I don't think you'd have to use a professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5543.987s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It would be for new hires, maybe during their new hire orientation, they would be trained for ALICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5549.21s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: She was trained once three years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5550.611s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: She's still a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5551.531s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if it's something that you have to be trained, it's the same training year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5557.114s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's something we can look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5558.475s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it might not be, it could be part of that week of orientation for new teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5564.765s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because I don't, but we'll have to clarify if you have to be retrained every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5626.386s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the meeting when you were in Colorado, the chief supported it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5631.688s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: A young man who was an EMT spoke about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5635.289s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And a mother of three children who professionally is an ALICE trainer spoke very eloquently about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5641.932s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's how it came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5964.851s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5965.091s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5965.791s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5966.452s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: On the second to last page, just the last sentence, just as we think of pre-budgets, it says, while there are school adjustment Councilors at the elementary level, there may be the need for additional guidance Councilors at that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5979.48s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is that recommending guidance Councilors for elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5998.364s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I know we at the Roberts have an adjustment Councilor that is great and works nonstop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6006.75s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So she does the social, emotional well-being part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6010.053s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are you suggesting a guidance council for elementary for more academic part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6014.217s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6015.298s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just to think of staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6053.384s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Does the high school have adjustment Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6058.806s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And who does the adjustment Councilors, what department does it fall under?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6061.727s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6062.687s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6063.248s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's another budget that we'll hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6073.091s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3086.017s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Diane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3088.418s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One of the concerns was staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3090.159s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And this is more just, I think, what Erin was saying for us to get a head start on budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3095.061s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For the four schools, could you just, if you can offhand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3099.593s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: say how many kindergarten classes they have, how many Title I teachers they have, and how many literacy support teachers each school has?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3123.391s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One literacy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3154.035s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that almost makes up the difference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3155.596s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3156.277s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3157.598s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then with the other options, so the plan is not to pick renaissance this year, but to try the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3169.072s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Fountas, Pinnell, are the words their way next year to pilot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3197.437s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, and then the comments, were they from a survey that all the grade one teachers took?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3201.922s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know where the comments came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3208.605s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And all the grade one teachers were part of the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3211.626s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Every single one of them, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3212.587s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3220.971s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we don't have to move yet on Renaissance, because from the comments, it doesn't seem like it's supported by many teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3246.803s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3247.744s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3248.004s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3248.724s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5691.487s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5692.368s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I just, you do a ton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5694.169s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I just wanted to give a shout out to Mr. Connor, the Roberts School teacher, music teacher, who now already stays after school Tuesday for our hand chime choir for fourth and fifth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5706.039s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: He stays after school on Thursday for fourth and fifth graders for trombone for an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5710.883s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then he stays and lets sixth, seventh, and eighth graders come back and teaches them for an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5716.382s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then now on Friday, he's keeping kids after for a little recorder ensemble to be in one of the music concerts in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5724.388s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So he is one of the most humble, hardworking music teachers I've ever met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7594.429s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just want to say that the pastor's wife has four small children, three of them are at the Roberts, and they do a ton of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7603.723s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7604.584s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7605.024s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7605.284s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I second the motion of Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1784.507s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I will be brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1785.547s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I I'm excited that we have an action plan that we can all work on and moving forward Secondly Reverend Wendy and Reverend D came over my house today to talk about an interfaith service about peace in our schools I hope you'll all attend once we get it planned I think it's great for our community to come together for peace and Third is we were gonna have a Guinness in June and now we're gonna have a Guinness in April Mr. Superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=264.038s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We are going to make a motion at the end of this meeting, so I don't know if I should just fill the report then or do it now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=270.807s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=271.388s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So for those of you who were not at our last meeting, Cheryl Rodriguez, a mother from the Roberts, had come to explain to us that she was applying for a CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=281.475s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Community Preservation Act grant for the Roberts Playground surface area, which is very torn up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=287.36s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It would fall under both recreation and open space of the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=291.323s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The other two categories are affordable housing and historical site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=296.147s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So she was looking for us to support her in her round two of the application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=300.75s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: She made it through the first round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=301.891s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Cheryl's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=302.512s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm not making sure everything I'm saying is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=306.275s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So it was moved to our subcommittee where we, the three of us, it was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=311.171s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kathy, myself, and Erin, and that we recommend that the school committee allows her to move forward with looking for these CPA funds for the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1508.497s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1508.697s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1509.598s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: In the minutes, Michael, Member Ruggiero, suggested that the ADA be added to the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1516.582s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I see on the checklist, it says review the district trip policy and ADA regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1521.085s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then will part of their package also add the actual list of ADA?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1524.527s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't know the ADA regulations myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1540.047s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But I'm saying when a teacher takes this, the way to do it, the AD English isn't going to be part of this package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1547.091s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They have to go to the website and look up the AD regulations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1575.98s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right, but I'm saying if you have a checklist and all the forms that you need are part of this package, wouldn't the ADA regulations make sense just to have them part of this package so you don't have to go to a computer to look up the regulations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3406.356s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3406.576s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3409.399s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3410.419s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So, in the past, people have suggested we have these at the elementary schools, the Columbus, Brooks, Roberts, and McGlynn, because parents do not have the opportunity if they have, if they come kindergarten to ever go in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3426.988s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So two of them at the high school, which is great, but I'm just wondering if maybe next year we could have one at each of the elementary so the family can see the school their child will be attending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3822.927s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: moment of 21 plus students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3824.128s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They are two teachers except for media production TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3828.07s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So they have 35 total enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3839.265s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: with one teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3839.905s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just wondering, are they looking for another teacher for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3851.59s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, but right now it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3880.868s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3884.61s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5118.821s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5120.262s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: With charter schools, I feel like Mystic Valley was the one that I always heard about, probably when Quinn was starting school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5126.286s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Then I heard about Prospect Hill, and now there's Pioneer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5129.247s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is there any other ones that I'm missing that Medford residents go to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5210.687s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'll second, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5818.127s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I move that the School Committee approve submission of the Robbins Elementary Playground Proposal to the City Preservation Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1303.083s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I can call a subcommittee for buildings and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1305.525s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Aaron, Kathy and I are on it and we invite Cheryl and we can all and John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1309.527s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: There she go, Cheryl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1312.089s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We're gonna so we'll meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1313.45s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So Aaron, Kathy and I are on the subcommittee for buildings and grounds and then I'll just email us all to get together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2221.284s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Um, so you had listed on our packet, the state of New Jersey has a resolution, the list of religious holidays permitting student absence from school and there's a long list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2231.193s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is that something that we could consider?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2242.502s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2242.682s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But we don't have a resolution on fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2244.704s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2245.004s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is this something that we know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2249.154s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, so you're just showing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2251.375s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3279.052s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is it the same number every year for the PTO?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3282.053s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's the federal ID number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4594.631s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4594.831s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mostow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4595.792s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It says 83 people have school systems of five and 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4600.255s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do we know who are the 15 of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4618.4s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then they have a few dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4620.842s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One date for the accelerated repair is February 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4624.125s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are you going for that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4640.034s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And is there anything you have to do for this application by April that's different than what you're supposed to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4657.787s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is it that the other people are more in need than you think the 15 got it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4661.65s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4675.88s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5854.683s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The first page, the last paragraph under policy is students without meal money on a consistent basis will have outreach provided by the administration to investigate the situation more closely and take further action as needed to assist in providing an application for services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5872.307s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So how, like I'm just thinking the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5875.489s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So a lunch woman, I'm sorry, I don't think there are any men, I'm not being sexist, sees that there's negative balance of 9.75 for the high school student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5887.618s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That woman, that dining service will then call someone for help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5919.202s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5919.482s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But when you're saying outreach, are you saying, I'm going to send them, because I've gotten it, low balance from Nevin at the Roberts, or are you saying someone will actually call and say, is something going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5953.353s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And will it be your office that will be doing the calling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9539.724s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4591.358s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do we know who the 15 are that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4609.453s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then they have a few dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4648.836s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is it that the other people are more in need, that you think the 15 got it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4666.932s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5846.303s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The first page, the last paragraph under policy is students without meal money on a consistent basis will have outreach provided by the administration to investigate the situation more closely and take further action as needed to assist in providing an application for services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5863.238s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So how, like I'm just thinking the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5866.422s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So a lunch woman, I'm sorry I don't think there are any men, I'm not being sexist, sees that there's negative balance of $9.75 for the high school student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5878.156s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5880.258s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: dining service will then call someone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5910.4s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But when you're saying outreach, are you saying, I'm going to send them because I've gotten it low balance for Nevin at the Roberts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5916.125s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are you saying someone will actually call and say, is something going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5944.25s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: and will it be your office that will be doing the calling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2885.274s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Riccadeli, so Mr. Zizzo is the point person for the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2888.896s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is there a point person at the McGlennan where they invited as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2936.803s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So there's four seventh grade global scholars, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2939.865s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Two at each middle school, A and B side?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2941.926s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2942.867s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So should that be something we should think about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2947.104s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: to let a McGlynn rep go, just to bring it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3010.91s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I mean, I think Mr. Zizzo's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4961.389s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then the other that just caught my attention, because I know it's been a while that we've been waiting to pilot, the Inspire Science Program was adopted this year by Stoneham Public Schools of the K through 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4971.075s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So they didn't pilot programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4972.837s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They just went with it and started this past September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4980.933s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And are they having any regrets?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4982.073s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do you have a contact there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4985.055s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4985.715s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4986.295s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They kind of threw the dice and bought a whole curriculum for a whole school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4990.157s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5763.95s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: for a minute just to make a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5767.712s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Kathy, I spoke to Kathy, a parent emailed that there is currently not a behaviorist at the Glen Elementary, our middle school, and there are children who are on IVs who have it in their IV for behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5780.14s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I know you're interviewing currently, but if there's something we can do to help get it moving, I don't know if we can subcontract with the company until someone's hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5792.297s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But the parent is very concerned that there's not a behaviorist at that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5859.929s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And I'm unclear of the roles of everyone, but in the McGlynn, they said the adjustment Councilor is doing some of what a behaviorist would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5867.811s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is the adjustment Councilor the same schooling as a behaviorist?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5871.351s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: OK, so a BCBA is an analyst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5913.63s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And is there a shortage of behaviorists in our area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5979.947s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is our salary comparable to areas around us for our behaviorists?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5985.161s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And have you had any leads?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5662.585s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Are we looking for September of 2018 to move half the EL to the Andrews?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5678.878s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So we want to move kids in unless we can make sure that things are going to be a little bit more balanced all around And then I don't know because it's been 20 months what might have happened before I was on I was assigned to the Roberts for my children, and then I did not choose the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5694.973s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I love the Roberts I can't say enough about mr. Johnson, but then I get to pick middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5699.437s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Why don't we just assign?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5702.14s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Families to one or the other middle school, so you don't have kids who are on a waitlist with your support We could entertain that as one of the options Before you go down that road we our schools were built on a racial balance plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5726.586s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't choose elementary, so weren't they built with the middle of the... No, you could choose elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5789.881s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right, but it's not, to the family at home with a preschooler, no one thinks that we're a choice system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5797.026s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Everyone thinks you go to the school closest to your house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5853.31s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I know, but we're not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5855.031s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Selling ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5855.952s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I don't go in with my four-year-old and say Roberts number one Columbus number two I don't there's really not a choice system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5879.588s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right, who are in the know to write a letter or an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5882.81s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But when you go to register your child, it doesn't say you get to choose the elementary school you want to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5887.573s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: They say to me, you live on Morgan Ave, you go to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5890.595s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And unless you are informed or active on Facebook Medford Moms, you don't know that you can choose what school to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5910.424s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Right, but if we are, for middle school you would get a choice, one or two, but we don't get that for elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5919.066s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just saying then why do we give a choice at the middle school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5929.116s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Not if we do a random lottery for kids going to middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5948.54s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No, because you said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5950.294s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: back, McGlynn used to be the choice school, and they had over-enrollment, so it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6208.911s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One at a time please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6796.641s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: She had a hundred last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6927.658s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: With the federal funding, you said they had to be schools with a similar student population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6933.044s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What did you say about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6933.985s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6934.706s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: State, sorry, not federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6936.288s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But how does the Andrews have 20% low and reduced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6943.235s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But 20% to 44% for that subgroup is pretty big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7422.929s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can I just say, is Lumiere less than 150 units?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7425.471s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7426.852s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is Lumiere one of those addresses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7428.393s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7428.493s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just don't know what the address is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7478.355s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Can we just go back to the buildings, just because I don't know the addresses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7481.678s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So 100 Rivers Edge Drive, where's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7491.387s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7492.728s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 3600 Mystic Valley Parkway, is that behind the old Mall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7494.71s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7494.81s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7499.458s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And that 3920 Mystic Valley Pathway?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7522.184s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then the boat that's station landing, and then Riverside Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=8296.071s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Christine, just on the first page, the third paragraph, the last one, the undistributed unemployment, is that one employee or is that a number of employees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=8307.135s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=8308.735s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And is that, so it's 72,000, is that accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=8312.777s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is that a typical year for unemployment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1410.817s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What page?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1411.497s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I can't hear you, Erin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2052.796s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: with enrollment, and I don't know if this might be for Diane Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2057.876s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: For last year, we have last year district enrollment for 9.916 compared to this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2063.218s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the only for the high school vocational last year was 13.65, this year is 13.50, so that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2071.7s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School were 9.46, now we're 9.38.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2076.161s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The one that I'm just curious if you have any insight is the total for the four elementary last year were 18.92, and this year was 16.08, a difference of 284.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2086.444s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Is that something with our demographics or I don't know if that seems like such a big bump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2096.783s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2101.285s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I can't hear anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2106.827s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2107.847s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2108.208s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2586.764s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: We found it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2587.604s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: It was the missing kindergarten column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4567.736s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I feel like we're at two different meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4569.598s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: What was the answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4820.693s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Christine, do you have an estimate of how many of our school children take buses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4825.594s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Or could you get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4826.615s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4827.395s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: You know, at the Roberts, I try to encourage as many parents because it's such a traffic nightmare of how many students use our buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4884.236s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: next few weeks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4894.587s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But five of mine take the bus, and I filled out five forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4897.949s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So there is a form with the child's name on it in each of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4901.292s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I'm just curious of what percent of each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4904.674s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I understand that some kids take it two mornings a week and three afternoons a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4908.336s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But even if we got an estimate of numbers, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4913.119s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5354.593s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So is that the list you use when you make the robocalls from school grades?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5359.538s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So that's what I think Kathy's asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5361.72s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So does the parent just go online and change the information or do they call the school secretary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5829.045s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So when you, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5831.906s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5832.106s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mestone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5833.046s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So when you came here to the Parent Information Center to enroll your children, were they all set to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5838.248s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yes, they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5838.848s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So then what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5839.929s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I'm just confused of how it all went down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5887.324s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I don't know the law, but isn't it wherever you lie your head the most is where you go to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5893.207s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: But it seems like the court order isn't live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8697.802s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: He's laughing because he knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8701.245s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8706.028s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So I just remember when the dress code came up between the Andrews and the McGlenn and how they were so different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8712.252s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So in the handbook at the elementary, like every elementary has their own handbook, the two middle school have their own handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8718.957s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Will this just be cut and pasted into it, or is this like an addendum to the part that it already speaks about the dress code in the different handbooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8924.737s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: So the current ones are all getting removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8927.217s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: The current ones are all being removed and this will be the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10954.176s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10957.946s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10958.867s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was surprised at the under the behavior system that all the information now that we have at our fingertips that there were 278 suspensions and I was just hoping you could give me a report at some time in the near future if that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10974.482s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: One student who may have been suspended 10 times, or that's 270 individual students that were suspended once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10980.425s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: I was just surprised at that number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11001.973s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Yeah, I don't even know where it's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11013.782s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5982.463s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Mustone, I was just wondering about the English language learner summer program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5994.949s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Because that, I think, is a great program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6005.349s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: In lunch and transportation, I would think you could get a hundred percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6034.479s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: And then on the special ed program, the last part is there's approximately 142 students requiring the various services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6041.505s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Do all 142 take advantage of these programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6066.865s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Just maybe if they're not 100%, maybe there's a way to outreach more to get more people to them.<br><br>
