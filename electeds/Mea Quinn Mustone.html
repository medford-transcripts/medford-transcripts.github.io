 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=787.589s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2395.325s">Member</a> Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2396.065s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2396.586s">Thank</a> you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2398.167s">I'm</a> just curious about the mini class. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2400.289s">So</a> I think the advantage of that with Mr. Skorka was that he was so accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2403.832s">And</a> he was such a gift to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2405.954s">I</a> remember one student saying to me, everyone should have Mr. Skorka in their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2409.797s">And</a> I think everyone would agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2411.459s">So</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2413.36s">besides</a> that he had a gift and a vocation for that work, are you going to hire someone? <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2418.584s">Are</a> you posting, I don't know if his title was formerly assistant director, but I think it's hard to do the work unless you're in a classroom in the hallways with kids because they're coming and going as we all know with teenagers and to pin them down, that was the advantage of the power of Mr. Skorka. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2433.575s">He</a> was always available for every student all the time.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2451.153s">So</a> will you replace a lead teacher at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2454.415s">I</a> just think it's hard for kids to get work done when there's not an adult who's always available to them.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2496.419s">So</a> will the advisor be the mini course teacher?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2564.041s">It</a> does. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2564.641s">I</a> don't think it's going to be as successful with not having a lead teacher as the advisor because he was just always available. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2572.686s">I</a> mean, I just know from my own senior who had been very involved and from her classmates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2578.629s">So</a> I guess my recommendation would be ideal if the advisor was the lead teacher because then the kids have wonderful ideas that take a lot of footwork to get them happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2588.314s">So</a> that's my only concern.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=3026.436s">That</a> one's from Amazon.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=3336.979s">I</a> also think Mr. Jackson sounds like a great candidate for the CCSR advisor program.<h2><a href="../2023-05-04_ZOridbGJ9hA/2023-05-04_ZOridbGJ9hA.html">MSC - Special Education Subcommittee Meeting - 5.3.2023</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4498.957s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4499.097s">Stone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4500.398s">So</a> three of our kids are going on the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4503.519s">I</a> will be not chaperoning for a 24-hour train ride, but if you do get Southwest, then I would like to volunteer to chaperone if you get that flight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4512.683s">So</a> thank you, but Teague and Nevin and Rowan seem to be very excited that they think it's the Orient Express that they're going on to Florida.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11985.797s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11986.84s">Thank</a> you everybody for all the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11989.262s">I</a> do feel like I'm kind of in a time warp because it was probably more than five years ago, or maybe just about, I don't think many people in this room were there then. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11998.147s">There</a> was a concern with MCAS that the Brooks had nailed it in every area, in every grade, in every subject, and unfortunately other schools did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12006.412s">And</a> what came up was Title I, the three schools had Title I, but the Brooks still had a reading specialist that did the work of Title I, but wasn't paid for by Title I. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12015.109s">At</a> the Roberts, I know firsthand, oh, I can figure it out, because Quinn was in second grade, and now she's a sophomore in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12019.852s">So</a> that's how long ago it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12021.513s">So</a> she tested for Title I. Unfortunately, she was not the lowest of the seven that made it to Title I. So her teacher said, unfortunately, she's not the lowest of the seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12032.44s">You're</a> right, she definitely has a reading hiccup. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12035.402s">So</a> I said, so if she was in another class or another school, she might have been the lowest of the seven, depending who her peers were. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12041.966s">So</a> I think, and tell me if I'm not saying what people are thinking, but I think that's where the concern is like we have schools that have much greater need, but they still have the same staff as the Brooks who's doing great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12055.457s">So</a> I think that's where the frustrations coming from like shouldn't we put the support for the school that might have 14 kids who really need title one but only seven of them are eligible.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12204.881s">And</a> right, we have math. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12206.843s">Remember</a> what the yeah, the teacher had been out and then the replacement was out.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12221.852s">But</a> no, but it's a good conversation.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12247.774s">That's</a> good news too.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12255.964s">You</a> said they're back? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12256.864s">Sorry,</a> I thought you meant they increased their numbers.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12273.248s">So</a> more support should go there.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12275.189s">Great.</a>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1342.289s">How</a> many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.39s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.55s">So</a> that's a very large percentage.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1360.217s">So</a> 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1369.725s">Do</a> you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1382.575s">So</a> then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1413.658s">And</a> then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.669s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.969s">So</a> it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=107.878s">So</a> because all the kids have different favorite places, we try to make the rounds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=114.904s">Rowan</a> loves Collette's Bakery. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=116.826s">She</a> loves the bread there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=117.987s">I</a> would say Nevin and Declan are partial to Colleen's and their ice cream. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=122.671s">Teagan</a> and Cullen are big Tenoch people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=126.955s">And</a> then Quinn, who's now in school in Vermont, but when she's home, I'm trying to think of what Quinn's go-to probably is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=136.078s">I</a> think she'd probably say she would want, oh I know, a sandwich at the Magnificent Muffin. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=142.824s">She</a> loves their breakfast sandwiches.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=147.148s">Oh</a> that's a good point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=148.169s">So</a> when Tim and I can sneak out, it's usually to Salvatore's because it's close to home and it's good food and it's quick and we know we're not far from the house.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=176.714s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=177.935s">People</a> probably who follow Method Politics are probably tired of this story, but I will share it again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=186.182s">In</a> 2015, in the summer, a young man announced he was running John Emerald, and he had a press release in the paper, and I read it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=193.748s">He</a> had great ideas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=194.869s">He</a> was an Arlington High School teacher, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=199.012s">He</a> was probably, I would think, maybe mid 20s, but the ideas escape me now, but I thought, well, this young man has great ideas for the students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=210.043s">So</a> my dad was over and I was saying, Dad, I'm going to hold a sign for this young man. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=216.053s">know</a> when he has a sign hold out in the square what have you and my dad said why don't you hold your own damn sign so I said oh okay so he said Mia you're always at the schools you're always you know trying to make things work at the Roberts at the time I only had kids at the Roberts this is um <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=237.1s">Well,</a> maybe Quinn was at the Andrews. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=239.061s">But</a> anyways, um, so the kids were around and they said, yeah, mom, you should do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=243.382s">You</a> should do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=244.182s">So</a> that's what prompted to me to run as well as at the same time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=249.343s">The</a> kindergarten powers were only half day and whoever was in kindergarten at the time had a pretty. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=260.388s">um,</a> large class with only a half-time para. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=264.911s">So</a> I had attended a school committee meeting right before I probably had the conversation with my dad saying, could we have full-time paras? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=273.396s">And</a> the school committee at the time was very receptive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=276.678s">Um,</a> it didn't happen immediately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=278.279s">Then</a> I ran and when I was sworn in, it was still a topic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=282.902s">And</a> then <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=284.002s">it</a> was probably six months into my first term that full-time aides were approved in the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=288.605s">So</a> that was the real, I really just, that's what I ran on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=292.968s">The</a> first election was full-time kindergarten in Paris.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=318.003s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=318.583s">I</a> was in your same exact spot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=320.904s">I</a> don't think I could have named one school committee member before I went to that first meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=328.491s">I</a> think that is an excellent question, because there is not a thorough explanation of the school committee on our city's website about our roles and responsibilities, about our policies, which we're working on now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=348.863s">We</a> just did pass an 18-page <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=351.912s">Policy</a> so that, you know, if you were to be a new member of the school committee, you would have this policy book to know how the school committee meetings run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=363.217s">And</a> I think going to the school committee meetings is probably the most helpful because you see, oh, the agenda is posted the Friday before the meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=373.504s">So</a> the agenda is the most helpful because then you know what the topics are that will be addressed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=377.327s">But</a> then attending in person to hear from the community members that speak, to hear from the other school committee members who share their questions or ideas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=388.198s">you're</a> right it's almost you have to get right into the groundwork and go to the meetings to find out what the topics are and how um because there's not even a place after the meetings to find out until the minutes are released of what the votes were on the different resolutions or motions sure and i think i guess i'm also wondering like how do i learn
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=426.369s">And</a> I think that's an excellent question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=428.069s">That's</a> not clearly defined. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=429.469s">I</a> think school committee members ourselves sometimes have differing opinions of what is appropriate for us to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=438.927s">respond</a> to a parent, you know, we have, I'm just saying, in recent times that I can remember, we've received emails about the after school program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=450.81s">the</a> length of recess, the food service options. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=456.273s">Some</a> of them we can address or say where it's been discussed at past meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=462.636s">Some</a> we do have to recommend they get in touch with the person who is that's under their jurisdiction. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=470.78s">But</a> for me, I think <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=472.769s">Any</a> parent with any question is welcome to email us and I try to find the right person to connect them with because I do know more of the administration and the staff and the directors because it is overwhelming to try to figure out which person would a person need a parent need to reach out to to get an answer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=491.914s">So</a> I'm happy to connect.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=510.76s">So</a> the office hours would be the best place to share your concerns or questions or thoughts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=518.204s">We</a> can't have three or more school committee members have an open forum because then it's broken, breaking open meeting law because there'd be no official posting our agenda. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=528.309s">So</a> you could meet with three school committee members, which has happened in the past, if there's a specific concern, you know, before COVID, we had met with students, high school students who worked <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=540.648s">for</a> the after school program about wages, so that I'm just trying to think of specific meetings that were not school committee recognized, but were three members.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=563.489s">Yeah,</a> right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=563.909s">So</a> this will be my seventh year.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=574.392s">Well,</a> let's think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=577.473s">Well,</a> I think we have a very active or engaged school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=584.735s">We</a> have, let me do the math, one, two, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=589.238s">Three,</a> four, six of us have students currently in Metro Public Schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=595.543s">So</a> I think having that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=599.427s">point</a> of view or being in the buildings, we have the ability to talk to parents, you know, off the cuff, just to hear what's happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=610.271s">So</a> I do think that's probably the biggest advantage of the what's the most helpful is that the school committee members, we're all someone had said to me years ago, when I first ran, well, you have skin in the game, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=622.795s">You</a> want the schools to be great for every student, including your own kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=629.495s">So</a> I think that's what we do well, is that we're all very engaged. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=634.018s">I</a> think, I'm trying to think now with all of us, we don't have, no, I was gonna say, we don't have a parent with children in every elementary school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=644.904s">We</a> have parents who have children at the Brooks, the Roberts, and then we have kids at the McGlynn and the Andrews in the high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=659.391s">So</a> if anyone listening there, and if you live in the Mississippi neighborhood or the McGlynn Elementary neighborhood, please consider running, because I do think it's important to have representation from all the schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=670.975s">As</a> we all know, we're not a ward-based system, so we're all citywide. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=675.736s">So</a> it'd be great to have people from every school be able to participate in the school committee and encourage the administration on what needs to be done or what needs to be improved.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=704.442s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=705.363s">To</a> have every school have parents on the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=709.625s">Because</a> not every school is the same, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=711.325s">Different</a> schools have different needs and they all need to be addressed.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=752.054s">Right</a> now, so our and I don't have the exact numbers, so I don't want to misspeak. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=758.479s">But</a> we do have Everett students who are in our vocational program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=762.822s">So</a> I'm not sure if that's where if you're thinking along those lines that we are partnering that our vocational school is growing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=772.969s">Our</a> vocational school is is really <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=777.981s">room</a> by leaps and bounds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=780.142s">One</a> concern that I have received emails about is that there is unfortunately no plumbing shop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=785.786s">And</a> Mr. Fallon, who is a terrific director of the vocational school, he has spoken about how plumbers in this market are doing really well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=794.531s">And</a> it's hard to give up if you own your own plumbing business to give up to teach. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=802.056s">But</a> that is something that they're constantly trying to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=806.311s">look</a> for candidates to start a plumbing shop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=809.973s">So</a> that's, yeah, I can't think of other partnerships we've done with other surrounding towns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=815.855s">That's</a> the only one that I can think of offhand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=818.056s">But</a> I'm sure if it's a proposal that you're familiar with in another part of the state or another country, we're always up to looking into how to bring good programs here.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=895.081s">So</a> that's a great question because that is one of the few things that school committee actually has jurisdiction over. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=901.683s">So</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=902.383s">We</a> hire and supervise the superintendent with a yearly evaluation and that contract negotiation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=910.087s">We</a> balance the, I shouldn't say balance the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=914.83s">We</a> go through the budget hearing process and then vote on the budget we put forward that then would go to the city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=922.014s">And</a> then we set school policy, which I think for a long time, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=928.827s">the</a> school committee and me included. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=930.649s">I'm</a> talking about myself in my early years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=932.892s">We</a> didn't take advantage of how policy is so beneficial in how making policy is beneficial for the students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=942.162s">So</a> that's something that is new to I think almost the culture of school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=946.027s">And</a> I feel like it's moving along, you know, with the policy <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=950.387s">with</a> the free lunch last year and it's going to be continued. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=954.408s">And</a> Paul had done a policy about dental care and that was implemented. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=960.569s">So</a> I think when, with the policy is where you really get all the rubber hits the road, I would say, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=967.53s">People</a> can talk about, oh, we're going to try this in the classroom, but unless it's in a policy, no one has to follow it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=973.912s">So</a> that's why it's, it is really important when, and I'm learning, I'm still learning, you know, seven years in, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=980.673s">when</a> you write a resolution or a motion to have exactly what you want to see come forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=987.817s">You</a> know, Sharon just wrote a great resolution about social emotional supports and really to see where we are and where we need to go and how it's being addressed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1002.846s">So</a> I think it's really pinpointing the wording of all this, but policy is definitely <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1010.31s">the</a> way to move things forward.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1085.68s">I</a> can't share much, but what I can share is that there is a negotiating team the you the teachers union has their executive board and then the administration has their represent representatives. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1099.582s">There</a> are no school committee members on the negotiating team when no one is in the meetings that take place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1105.948s">We</a> do hear periodically through executive session an update of how the union negotiations are going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1114.996s">They</a> are not public right now, so I cannot share what is happening or how they're going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1122.763s">I</a> do know that we've received some emails from parents saying we want to make sure you support a fair contract for the teachers and it seems <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1134.688s">someone</a> else had recommended an email and I wish I had Googled the term before I started speaking with you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1140.89s">Some</a> cities and towns do an open negotiation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1145.631s">I'm</a> not sure if that has more success or more beneficial or people feel better about it than the negotiations that are happening now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1153.833s">It'd</a> be interesting <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1156.592s">I</a> should probably try to find a school district who does it and see what the pros and cons are for whether they are private negotiations or public negotiations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1165.434s">I</a> don't know enough about it to have an opinion yet, but it is something that someone had emailed asking if that was something that was ever talked about in MedFed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1176.077s">So</a> that's something I wanted to find out more about it.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1198.399s">There</a> are administrators, forgive me that I don't know exactly which administrators go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1203.341s">I</a> don't know if they all go to the, every meeting or if, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1209.062s">know,</a> they take turns for, I don't even know how often they meet with the Medford Teachers Association's executive board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1217.045s">So</a> I imagine we'll be hearing an update, I would think in the next few weeks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1223.767s">We</a> have a meeting, our next regular scheduled meeting is Monday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1226.988s">Oh,</a> and I didn't even look to see if there is an executive session scheduled yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1232.25s">I</a> did not look because they, it would be posted today if there was an executive session on Monday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1237.748s">But</a> if not, I would think soon we'll have an update of what where they are, where they're, where they're meeting or not meeting or there's a big divide. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1251.118s">I</a> should say between the two sides. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1254.5s">But</a> it's, I don't know, it doesn't, it seems like there should be a better way to make it work for teachers and administration to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1266.085s">I</a> just don't know what it is.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1273.491s">Yeah,</a> they have an executive board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1276.333s">And</a> then I don't know how many of the administrators are part of the administration negotiating team.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1287.566s">So</a> once I think they reach those two parties reach an agreement, then they come to us and we do approve the contract. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1295.149s">So</a> once they meet, and they have it in on paper, then we approve that contract. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1301.852s">And</a> then that contract would be put into the budget for the budget of this year.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1310.216s">That's</a> a good question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1311.437s">I</a> know I've done it before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1315.819s">So</a> it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1317.334s">At</a> least one time in the last six years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1320.496s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1344.43s">Right,</a> so that might be a good place right for a policy there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1347.833s">I</a> mean teachers can, I don't know what the stipend is now but they can have a course approved and be reimbursed for a course. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1355.699s">There</a> are the professional development days that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1359.618s">we</a> were given a presentation, I'd say a few months back of what the teachers, what the topics were the teachers covered. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/76Tt9vZ2mr0S9PjFUXB8Dy?t=1370.38s">But</a> I do think that's always a concern that there could be more reimbursement for teachers for classes, but that would be a budget constraint for the cost of teachers and classes.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1486.185s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1486.966s">Um,</a> I was thinking just having two girls at the Andrews and how popular so many of the clubs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1495.491s">I</a> know that the CCSR is partnering with a mom who's teaching a sewing class to <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1504.488s">create</a> toiletry bags, and then collect goods to stuff in the toiletry bags to give to the Bread of Life in Malden for their guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1513.691s">So</a> I didn't know, back to Tonya was talking about the buddy program. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1517.332s">I</a> didn't know if that could be a place that all kids could come together, pack the bags with their peers, and then follow up with maybe doing service projects together in conjunction with the buddy program. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1534.059s">I</a> don't know if that would be something that.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1651.848s">So</a> I guess just to move forward, could I work with someone at the Andrews Middle School to at least get, I think this will be a short, successful service project that we could have all kids involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1669.565s">I</a> don't know if anyone wants, I don't know if I'm overstepping or if that's something I can reach out and work with the teachers at the Andrews.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1694.023s">It's</a> miss been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1695.424s">And</a> it's just, I think it's, it's, it's nice because the kids will have, they'll be able to see their impact so the sewing club is going to make the toiletry bags, and then they're going to do a drive for you know, little toothpaste or deodorant or what have you, they have a list from bread of life, it will go into the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1715.822s">And</a> so, and I think it will just be a few, probably a few days that we'll meet after school to compile the toiletry bags and then pack up my van. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1724.345s">But</a> I think it'd be a great place for kids to be together and doing something fun and service to the community.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1745.628s">And</a> then I just don't know if there's teachers, Joan, you would know who the best teachers are to invite?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1769.171s">And</a> this literally just started in an email yesterday so we are fresh, you know, we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1773.814s">We're</a> not joining something that's happening it's just just an email started yesterday so we are all together at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1779.758s">Okay,</a> good.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1787.382s">Is</a> that the- I don't think so because they'll have to have a while to sew and the mom who sews has two groups because she only has 14 sewing machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1796.625s">So</a> I think she'll be a while before all the sewing kids will be able to sew their own toiletry bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1800.946s">So</a> I'm thinking probably more of the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1802.947s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1912.107s">Okay,</a> then I'll email you tomorrow, Joan. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1914.751s">All</a> right, sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1915.453s">And</a> whoever else wants to be on the email. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1916.735s">I'll</a> email everybody.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3344.823s">But</a> they're in the schools now, but are they not seeing kids directly yet?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3431.377s">But</a> is there a ballpark of how many students say they've seen at the four elementary schools combined?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3475.505s">All</a> right, I guess I'm just, I'm trying to figure out, is there an epidemic happening that there's a lot of families that aren't engaged and we need more than five team specialists? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3485.987s">Are</a> they seeing five kids a day or are they seeing one a week?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3576.993s">specialist</a> has met a family and they need a lot of assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3581.337s">So</a> then do they then meet weekly with the adjustment Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3584.56s">Do</a> we need more adjustment Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3586.001s">Or</a> I guess it's too early to learn what we're going to need after the engagement specialist are meeting with all these families and students?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3662.148s">So</a> then at the end of this year, will the initiative tell us what we should be prioritizing with staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3668.891s">I</a> imagine there's going to be a need for more staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3673.063s">there's</a> many families being referred to the specialist.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3690.773s">The</a> specialist is like a caseworker. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3692.714s">So</a> they're not seeing students one-on-one.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3696.556s">They</a> are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3696.976s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3697.356s">I</a> didn't realize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3698.137s">So</a> they can meet with students one-on-one.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5917.765s">So</a> I'll let you finish, but then.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6006.353s">Mr.</a> Murphy, I know it was long before you got here, but the teachers from those classrooms have been emailing for years that periodically they had flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6015.36s">So</a> I am a little upset that it took a parent to come here with pictures to finally get the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6023.787s">And</a> this is long before you were here, Mr. Murphy, but I guess moving forward and Kathy and I can both speak from being on the building and grounds committee over the years, that <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6034.856s">not</a> administrators, teachers or staff members would complain of a building issue and it never was addressed until it seems like a parent came and then it was addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6046.561s">So</a> I'm trying to figure out moving forward, how does the school committee, when we hear of these concerns, get the physical building concerns addressed without having to have a parent come out on a school night, take photocopies <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6061.775s">18</a> pitches times the eight of us here to move forward on our physical structures.<h2><a href="../2021-09-13_ZvcDJHTayW4/2021-09-13_ZvcDJHTayW4.html">Regular School Committee Meeting 9.13.2021</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8583.398s">Could</a> a school information system possible quote be moved in as well with that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8591.902s">I</a> do think the papers, I just, in this day and age, the papers for the bus pass, the emergency contact, the, I don't know if it's called family biography or what the top of the one is, that it's teeny tiny lines and teeny tiny space. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8611.272s">Um,</a> but I think if we go to a school information system that the parents is more user friendly, so I'm not sure if that could be included to just quote some. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8620.341s">I</a> know three offhand because I know other schools who use them, but I would appreciate if that could be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8626.547s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=135.897s">I</a> think we're all overtired in our house. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=137.638s">We're</a> all a little slap happy.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3094.167s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3094.647s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3095.688s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3097.18s">Mr.</a> Murphy, correct me, because I'm getting all the budgets confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3100.121s">For</a> transportation, I saw that both Mr. Maloney talked about after school, late buses for middle school, Andrews and McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3108.602s">And</a> then also Mr. Textera mentioned to do something with the ELL students with the late bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3115.103s">So</a> is the transportation budget, have we not seen it yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3118.944s">Or</a> is it the meeting I missed?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3178.321s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3178.862s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3180.221s">And</a> then the other question was, now I'm looking to, I'm sorry that, Paul or Mayor, you can ask someone else and I'll get back to it.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2150.01s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2151.931s">Just</a> two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2154.671s">Thank</a> you guys all for all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2156.532s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2157.592s">Schulman,</a> I think it's a great idea about the school Councilor for the ELL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2162.754s">I</a> didn't know if 0.6 is enough for both middle school and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2167.235s">If</a> it was possible, that position could be increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2171.79s">Cause</a> I do think it's probably a good idea to have a both a middle school and high school and to have someone who's just 0.6 try to go between three buildings would be a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2182.472s">And</a> then the next, and I'm not sure Mr. Murray, if it's the gym teacher, would that be under a different department? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2194.814s">We</a> had talked about an adaptive gym teacher for the last, I wanna say at least two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2201.12s">Um,</a> so I, if that's a different department, I can hold it to another meeting, but I just want to get some clarity.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2219.737s">And</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2220.757s">I</a> did it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2221.338s">I</a> said, Mr. Murray, because Colin's teacher is David Murray, who I see.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2232.063s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4404.83s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4406.431s">Mr.</a> Murphy, I don't know if it's possible for you to screen share page seven, which lists the superintendent's draft recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4417.94s">That'd</a> be great if you can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4418.96s">So,</a> superintendent, I love your recommendations because I think those are things that we have learned through community and teachers and parents that are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4428.968s">For</a> the page seven,
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4433.956s">Is</a> this the... That is the one, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4436.677s">So</a> page seven, and now I'm gonna, sorry, Mr. Murphy, can you go to page eight? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4443.818s">Just</a> cause I was just highlighting what is in both the director's request and both the superintendent's direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4452.02s">That's</a> not the one.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4461.068s">It's</a> the one, it was in my package, page seven and then page eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4464.909s">So</a> it's, I think it's the whole department. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4469.77s">Um,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4475.052s">So</a> at the top, so they pretty, I guess, I don't know if you can probably see mine, but it lines up except under the director's personnel priorities.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4491.087s">So</a> under the director's personnel priorities, it lists two, four, six, eight, 10, 11, 12, 13 bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4498.894s">All</a> of the director's priorities are in the superintendent's recommendations except for the director's has three bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4509.344s">One</a> is behavior specialist at four specialists, <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4513.528s">One</a> is a meet ETL position and one is an administrative assistant for the Curtis Tufts High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4519.831s">So</a> they all sound like they are worthy priorities to be getting on the superintendent's recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4528.915s">I</a> wish I was tech savvy enough to show you just the <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4533.081s">the</a> two papers that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4535.282s">So</a> I love the superintendent's recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4537.583s">I'd</a> love for us to make a motion to get them into the budget, but I do think it's important to add the three that didn't make it to the superintendent's recommendations that were on the director's personnel priorities, which is the behavior specialist, the meet ETL position, and the administrative assistant for the Curtis Tufts High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4556.449s">So</a> I don't know if you know what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4559.99s">It</a> was page seven and eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4561.828s">It's</a> a Joan Bowen's report.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4797.239s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4797.62s">No,</a> I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4798.581s">I</a> don't know how all the schools and all the departments, their backstory to all of them, but I would, um, I do would like to make a motion that the superintendent's recommendations, cause those are the ones that you vetted more than the directors or the principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4812.111s">Um,</a> I would like to make a recommendation that we move forward to include the recommendations in the, in the budget, please.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4853.28s">I</a> can, because I think, what is today, Thursday? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4855.921s">Did</a> we meet on Tuesday? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4857.921s">And</a> you had followed up with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4859.242s">So</a> I am comfortable with making a motion that all four of the recommendation level priorities are included.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7141.189s">Very</a> good, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7142.55s">The</a> motion was just that the superintendent's recommendations, the four levels are included in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7151.477s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2021-05-03_s_C3Q_KGMQA/2021-05-03_s_C3Q_KGMQA.html">Budget Meeting:  Elementary and Secondary</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4617.57s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4621.05s">hard</a> to get a visual or for me to explain it accurately.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4629.217s">So</a> you can just go to the first one you see that has the... Yeah, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4634.702s">Where'd</a> you go? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4636.304s">Down</a> further. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4637.405s">The</a> one that lists critical FY22. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4638.906s">There</a> we have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4641.208s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4642.308s">So</a> I just want to talk about this slide or this part of the budget, because it's for all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4650.512s">And</a> as people can see, it says critical FY and the example of textbooks and the next one long term budgetary priorities, literacy and math coach positions, which we all know are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4662.036s">And</a> then additional, like <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4664.618s">said,</a> the water filling and playground equipment, which we know is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4668.263s">So,</a> Mr. Murphy, I'm just wondering, because I understand that everything is so departmentalized here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4676.492s">So</a> these numbers on the right were not in <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4680.69s">this</a> school's budget at the end of this part of this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4683.931s">So</a> are these line budget items going to be under a different department or are these something we would add to the end of this elementary ed budget?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4820.475s">So</a> there's- Okay, just so I know how to move forward.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4826.296s">Building-based</a> literacy and math. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4828.417s">Coaches</a> are specialists or interventionists, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4832.077s">Would</a> that go under Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4834.978s">Kahn</a> and the math department? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4836.558s">So</a> then I just have to make a mental note when Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4838.838s">Kahn</a> presents to make sure there's math <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4842.835s">specialist</a> in there or do I just make a note when we go through it at the end to make sure there's literacy and math specialist? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4850.821s">I</a> just, I love the superintendent's recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4854.283s">I</a> think the critical ones are a definite and the long-term budgetatory priorities are a definite. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4860.628s">So</a> I just wanna figure out how I can work with everyone to make sure at least those two top portions of the recommendations make it at the end of this.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4991.654s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4991.815s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4992.597s">Could</a> you scroll up for a minute just to another slide above this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4997.872s">Just,</a> nope, one more up, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5000.614s">Just</a> right here, just for parents and community members, because I was confused when I read this this morning, where you have grade levels pre-K to five, budget FTEs 28, actual FTEs 82. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5014.006s">Could</a> you explain that to our community members? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5017.148s">Because</a> I had no idea what the heck that meant.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5096.585s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5097.646s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5098.486s">I'm</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5099.146s">I</a> have no more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5100.066s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Murphy.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6842.962s">Just</a> because we're coming up, it's 8.56, I would, just because things move quickly and items are added or items are discarded, could I make a motion that at least the top two parts of the superintendent's recommendations are included <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6860.735s">in</a> the right budget, whether it's under special education or transportation or math department or elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6869.242s">So</a> under it would be the critical FY22 budgetary priorities, and then the next group, the long-term budgetary priorities.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6885.853s">So</a> it's really, it's the summary at the end of each school that shows the superintendent's recommendations and it's by priority level. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6894.543s">So</a> I think the first two priority levels are definitely necessities. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6900.67s">There's</a> a third that says additional budgetary priorities worthy of consideration that I think we can consider at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6907.793s">And</a> then it's COVID mitigation priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6909.713s">So</a> there's a recommendation for each school, but I would just <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6915.595s">like</a> to see the top two levels included under the right department or grade level just because I think the superintendent has listened to us over the past year and knows this is what the community has shared with us and teachers have shared with us and these are things that are necessary to move our children forward in September.<h2><a href="../2021-03-22_zdRFAfm1Rlg/2021-03-22_zdRFAfm1Rlg.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8770.601s">Yes,</a> I also signed on to the resolution with <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8773.513s">Member</a> Ruseau and Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8777.054s">And</a> I want to say the reason why we proposed it is because as we've learned of Columbus's legacy in recent times with more research and history, we realized that is not someone that we would like to hold up in a standard for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8792.82s">Most</a> people know I have six children, four in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8796.801s">He</a> is not someone that I want my children to think that's who we want to represent a school in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8805.284s">We've</a> heard a lot of conversation on both sides tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8809.366s">I've</a> had personal conversation with a number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8811.987s">I</a> have thought about it thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8814.328s">And</a> I know that there are many other opportunities to name a school and that we're not erasing history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8825.094s">It's</a> that he is not someone that represents what I wanna teach my children. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8830.358s">I</a> agree that he was a navigator, but other than that, there's nothing that I wanna encourage my children to say, this is someone that we admire and someone that I want you to look up to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8842.367s">So</a> I think that's how I agreed with my family discussing it that I signed on with Mr. Russo and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8849.232s">McLaughlin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8850.413s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17786.751s">That'd</a> be a big committee.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18155.394s">I</a> did not.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18160.772s">Sorry,</a> I just, I mean, I can see that if they get many names, I know with all the emails we got, I would say we probably were maybe 30 to 40 names were suggested in the emails we received over the last nine months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18179.718s">So</a> then this is opened up to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18182.975s">I</a> wonder if it will be a large number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18184.896s">So</a> no, I mean on the advisory committee, how many, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18188.737s">If</a> we're thinking about how much work they each have to do, they each get divvied up 40 names each to just, you know, Google their name and see what their story is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18195.94s">Um,</a> so probably 20.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20730.677s">Sure,</a> thank you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20736.141s">For</a> number 15, if the advisory committee recommends a timeline change, which I hear what Kathy's saying, for the time crunch it is now, could it be that in the meantime, that we will refer to the Columbus School with the temporary name of the South Medford Elementary School? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20760.765s">So</a> then it feels like we're moving forward, it's temporary, but if an extension is asked, if the advisory committee asked for an extension at that time.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20899.039s">No,</a> I mean, my heart is with the Mystic, but for this process, I think just to be able to move forward with a temporary name while the advisory committee asks for more time, the South Medford Elementary School buys us more time with also recognizing that we are no longer honoring Columbus.<h2><a href="../2021-03-01_fZRb63TV1uM/2021-03-01_fZRb63TV1uM.html">Committee of the Whole Meeting - Superintendent's Evaluation</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6131.71s">The</a> process to apply, I know that, I guess, a year and a half ago, people showed up at the office and waited and see if you were lucky enough to be first in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6142.352s">How</a> did it go this past sign up?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6148.033s">Oh,</a> so this is the first time to try. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6149.634s">So</a> what is the plan for the new system?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6199.669s">It</a> will still be the first come first serve, like who's ever sleeps over outside the Columbus school or?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6251.739s">Do</a> you have a question which has come up now at least for two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6254.741s">Is</a> this your third year? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6255.861s">No,</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6256.562s">Second</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6257.002s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6257.302s">So</a> maybe it's only come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6258.383s">Well,</a> I think it came up before you were appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6261.404s">The</a> budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6262.505s">So</a> we've heard that everyone pays in a system, but you don't get to see what the program brings in. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6268.568s">And</a> then you do pay for the snacks and the crafts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6271.631s">So</a> are you now able to see your whole spreadsheet?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6289.825s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6290.066s">What</a> made me think of it was because the wage is going to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6293.548s">So</a> that's going to be a bump in your wages or your salary line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6297.872s">And</a> then will that, is that already planned for uncovered for, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6301.078s">with</a> what you bring in in tuition?<h2><a href="../2019-10-23_UR250MtFq2M/2019-10-23_UR250MtFq2M.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 21, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3653.565s">I</a> just wanted to ask, so usually when something's too good to be true, it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3657.646s">So</a> with Lexia letting us use it for free, does that mean in June we have to budget for $500,000 for this program?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3707.372s">And</a> then what's dibbles per student?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3723.959s">»»</a> Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3724.62s">So</a> they are screeners.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3737.0s">So</a> are we looking at them together then, or are we looking at them separately?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3763.256s">So</a> does DIBL and MAP? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3765.586s">and</a> Rapid sell an intervention program like Lexia does?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3775.61s">I'm</a> just wondering, are we choosing it because it's free, or are we choosing it because it's the best option for the screeners?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3808.026s">So</a> I guess if the trial is for the year, and hopefully we learn which kids need the intervention, and then we will be looking then to use their intervention, the core five, then we do have to budget for $40 a student per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3824.69s">for</a> this program if this is what we use?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3850.049s">Right,</a> and I guess, I'm sorry I'm being cynical, and I owe that to Paul, because he says there's big money in education, and he's right, because he made me read a book about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3860.619s">So</a> I guess I'm just doubtful that, what is, is Lexia, is this really the best option out there, or do they market themselves so well, and give it to people for a year for free, that we end up thinking it's the best and we use it?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3906.594s">And</a> I'm not even being cynical just with the state of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3908.695s">I'm</a> being cynical with the Department of Ed of Massachusetts.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3954.278s">And</a> then with the core five for the intervention, <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3957.273s">Is</a> that, would that bring on more staff, or you are saying the classroom teacher would be the interventionist using the core five? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3963.196s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3969.36s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3970.58s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6543.809s">My</a> question was similar to Paul's. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6545.89s">So</a> we just take their word from their RFP that they pay their employees a living wage? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6551.946s">A</a> fair living wage? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6553.086s">They</a> don't say we pay our employees minimum wage?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6583.629s">Could</a> they look at it again to make sure?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6592.396s">So</a> when future RFPs for cleaning, can we put in the language that they use for contractor RFPs that we make sure that there is a living wage included in the RFP?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.068s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.368s">And</a> I know you didn't ask, so you wouldn't have the answer, but moving forward,
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6671.065s">Right,</a> but it sounds like we didn't ask that question in the current RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6673.686s">So</a> that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6674.527s">Moving</a> forward, can we put in the RFP that you provide whether it's a minimum wage or a living wage <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6681.724s">But</a> I mean, on a daily basis, we hear about how the cost of living in the city of Medford, no one can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6688.149s">So</a> it seems like we should be doing our part to have people who are working in our schools be able to have a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6694.934s">I'll</a> get off my soapbox.<h2><a href="../2019-09-25_35_tTrt91mM/2019-09-25_35_tTrt91mM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 23, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3080.814s">So</a> I will not read the report and hope I can't do the highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3085.055s">Our</a> agenda, five items that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3088.716s">The</a> first was speed bumps at the high school complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3093.117s">I</a> have emailed the chief of police and John Laughlin, our building manager, facilities manager, and they are looking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3102.84s">Second</a> was the flashing speed signs that you see throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3111.88s">telling</a> us what speed we're going, if it is below the speed limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3115.462s">Those</a> are all being used throughout the city, but when one frees up, it will go to the high school complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3123.407s">The</a> third was an update on the Andrew Glenn complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3126.869s">As</a> of today, the sidewalks and curbing has been completed, and there's just some detailing work that needs to be finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3135.976s">Number</a> four was regarding the school kitchen appliances, and that really stemmed from the desire to not use styrofoam plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3146.905s">Rhetta</a> Smith, the school nutritionist, did take an inventory. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3150.348s">We</a> do have many appliances throughout the school kitchens that need updating or repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3158.355s">led</a> us to a conversation with Alicia Hunt, who's the energy coordinator for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3162.297s">Kathy</a> Kreatz and I will be meeting with her and some state officials to discuss possible grant applications to update our school kitchen appliances and other ways to be green in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3179.009s">The</a> last item of our agenda was the Medford High School master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3183.372s">And</a> Mr. Brown, a teacher at the vocational high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3187.932s">gave</a> us a report from his perspective as both a teacher and a citizen, and what is the plan for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3197.38s">His</a> questions really led us to discuss, is it about rehabbing? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3204.646s">Is</a> it about looking for funding to build new? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3208.349s">Is</a> it about doing it in phases? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3212.552s">And</a> Kathy Kreatz had <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3214.781s">suggested</a> that we make a subcommittee that would almost be a master vision plan for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3221.964s">So</a> I would like to make a motion to create a subcommittee on a master vision for the high school repair and maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3236.511s">And</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.173s">Vision.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.813s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3720.712s">To</a> clarify, I think it evolved from our typical subcommittee, our eight subcommittees, to now more of a committee like the superintendent search where community members are involved, teachers are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3734.338s">It</a> won't be three of the standing school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3737.74s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4831.663s">Okay,</a> so there's English learners in the Columbus and the McGlynn, but not newcomers programs, that are a significant amount of students that they can take the, they have the data to give you a MET target or a C target, but there's not the number at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4848.946s">That</a> is English language learners.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4883.175s">And</a> because it's percents, I don't know the number of actual students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4886.238s">So</a> do you know, do the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts have <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4890.243s">pretty</a> similar numbers of students who take the access test?

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3017.779s">I</a> don't know the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3019.78s">The</a> only thing I could think of is maybe it's possible that because of toxic shock syndrome, that it's not something that the school feels comfortable, because then you'd be liable, God forbid, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3029.48s">someone</a> came with toxic shock syndrome.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3169.207s">Jonathan</a> just shared that the current dispensers have dual capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3173.849s">So</a> if the time comes that you need to dispense dual products, you can.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6706.182s">I'll</a> get it later.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7919.35s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7919.67s">So</a> last year we piloted McGraw-Hill and FOSS.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7923.432s">I</a> heard back that all the teachers thought McGraw-Hill was not a good program.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7928.214s">That</a> left us with only FOSS. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7930.115s">So</a> I'm not sure why we still are discussing, if we are doing it, shouldn't we just make a motion to buy it <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7937.585s">and</a> get the training on the calendar for teachers so they're ready in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7941.15s">I</a> mean, we've been having a science conversation for two and a half years now, for the two and a half years I've been on. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7946.777s">So</a> to delay it again, I'm losing my patience with science. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7951.322s">And</a> the MCAS test will show it tomorrow night.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7982.219s">I</a> mean I was shocked to go to my parent-teacher meeting and to hear that my fourth grader was doing McGraw-Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7988.005s">Because</a> I thought last year we decided everyone was going to do Foss because everyone had said McGraw-Hill was terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7993.892s">So</a> I'm sorry if I seem impatient. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7998.598s">But</a> it seems like Floss was the one that all the teachers said was worth investing in.

So it just has one top says elementary attendance, 9-6-18, and one has <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8825.5s">elementary</a> enrollment, 9, 26, 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8828.743s">So</a> enrollment is the ones that are registered in Parent Information Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8833.546s">The</a> attendance is just from School Brains that day.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8840.632s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8841.032s">So</a> the only thing that struck me was for the day of attendance, the Brooks had three absent out of 544. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8849.639s">The</a> Columbus had 11 absent out of 406. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8855.025s">The</a> McGlynn had 20 absent out of 478, and the Roberts had 9 absent out of 563. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8861.188s">I</a> didn't do the percentage yet, but just after hearing that report about chronic absenteeism, the 20 at the McGlynn did strike me to have 20 absent in one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8872.032s">So</a> is that something that is noted on school brains when a school has a higher percentage of absenteeism one day as opposed to another?

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4881.257s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4883.543s">unclear</a> of the two different processes that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4888.286s">Cheryl,</a> do you mind coming up again? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4890.407s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4891.948s">I</a> think there was just so much information that was just given. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4898.391s">I</a> feel like I just learned how to be a procurement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4905.228s">you</a> had said you had a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4907.13s">So</a> can you walk it through? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4908.932s">The</a> landscaping is one thing with removal and disposal and the purchase of the playground blocks, interlocking blocks is a different. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4921.408s">Yes,</a> that was always the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4923.53s">So</a> what would you, I'm saying if you, if you say this is right, what would you have us like, how would it start?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4955.932s">So</a> the RFP, there still needs to be an RFP because it's over $50,000 in product. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4961.516s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4967.64s">We</a> don't need an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4969.221s">And</a> that person is a state contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4971.382s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4972.223s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4972.623s">And</a> then what happens?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4994.812s">So</a> is the groundmaster still an option?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5026.137s">So</a> what the two estimates that came in at 223 and 224? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5031.13s">That</a> was not including what Groundmasters was already doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5034.091s">No,</a> that was the whole thing.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5039.313s">Okay,</a> so that was never part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5041.194s">So</a> Groundmasters was always on board, that was always the plan?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5086.303s">Okay,</a> so that seems absurd, right?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5101.873s">So</a> if the $90,000 for this company, Rubble, what was it called? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5107.317s">That</a> does not include some underlying, but ground masters can't do that either?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5117.985s">So</a> I know ground masters is removal and disposal and we have the product, but then there's some intermediate sod you need or something.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5128.357s">So</a> can either ground masters do that?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7094.774s">Tomorrow</a> night is the football opening game against Lynn Classical. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7100.419s">The</a> marching band will be performing halftime. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7102.642s">The</a> greatest showman, the movie, the greatest showman is the music. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7107.014s">So</a> if everyone wants to come out and support Medford football. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7110.015s">It's</a> at seven o'clock, right?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7111.396s">They</a> switched, this year the football games start at six. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7114.097s">Six.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7114.757s">They</a> used to be seven, now they're six.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7423.818s">For</a> the Andrews, Teagan and Colin brought home <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7428.193s">piece</a> of paper this size already filled out with my information and Tim's information. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7432.154s">And</a> it's just that if there are changes, change it and sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7436.315s">Nevin,</a> Rowan, and Declan, you're right, I had to fill out the same paper three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7443.056s">I</a> don't know how the Andrews, if the Andrews School is just more familiar with the School Brains software that they just printed out and sent it home. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7452.51s">I</a> don't know if Mr. DeLeva remembers.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7457.195s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7457.736s">Well,</a> do the high school kids get a piece of paper already with the information on it?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7488.338s">So</a> the high school, do you print it out and send it home?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7505.225s">Not</a> at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7506.066s">I</a> don't know about the Columbus, or the McGlynn, or the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7509.247s">Did</a> you have to fill out paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7510.608s">At</a> the Columbus, yeah.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7524.475s">But</a> if it is a school brain's capability, it was nice to have Tegan and Cullen just say, mom, just check this, and me say it's all the same and pass it back in, then filling out.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7537.502s">To</a> see how Mr. Downs did it, or Mr. DeLeva did it before he left.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9049.473s">But</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9050.794s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9052.535s">I</a> just want to inform the Roberts parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9055.337s">So</a> the number one bus at the Roberts is overcrowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9058.758s">Unfortunately</a> with the kindergarten added on today, there was a very overloaded bus that three of my own children ward, but Christine is working with Tatiana from the bus company and Mr. O'Brien, the Roberts vice principals working as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9071.902s">So</a> that will be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9072.903s">So</a> for parents who are concerned, it is being worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9075.944s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9076.344s">And</a> by next Monday, it should be evened out. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9078.486s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9178.794s">Can</a> you just talk about safety? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9181.256s">I</a> noticed that recently a crossing was hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9185.491s">and</a> it was school dismissal time, and I do think that I... Not at Medford, sorry, not at Medford, another city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9194.513s">But</a> even up with us on Highland Ave, and on our intersection of Highland Ave and Sturges, a number of times the bus will be stopped, he'll have the stop sign, and cars will pass while kids are getting out.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9246.713s">But</a> I know in the past that this has come up, not at your intersection, and that the DPW has gone and removed mounds of snow from a bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9254.36s">So</a> if you give us the heads up.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9291.366s">And</a> even in the past, parents have had, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9294.703s">parents</a> who have had concern, the police has sent someone for a few days, because a lot of times it's a regular commuter that is passing the bus, and the police presence has slowed people down to respect the bus rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9309.573s">So</a> maybe that's another, maybe the police department could look at Hadley Place in Salem.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10002.409s">I</a> just want to suggest that maybe we could even think about budgeting buying the supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10006.631s">So</a> a friend of mine works in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10009.68s">the</a> school department buys the supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10012.342s">She</a> did look it up while she was over at my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10014.224s">It's</a> 40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10015.365s">They</a> have a much smaller school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10017.846s">But</a> if we were to average $50 a student, it'd be $200,000 more or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10024.612s">So,</a> I mean, that is another goal that we could have because it is, I mean, I spent over $200 for the kids going to Staples. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10034.079s">So,</a> I mean, if we want to go beyond just trying to get a break on it, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10039.123s">Why</a> don't we put it into our school budget?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10043.525s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10043.866s">Potentially.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10044.546s">Somewhere</a> else.<h2><a href="../2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8/2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 18, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=477.835s">So</a> the parents were reimbursed for the lost iPhone.<h2><a href="../2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s/2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s.html">Medford School Committee Meeting May 21, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4368.597s">You</a> had just read the six languages, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4374.122s">Are</a> there any other language that is taught at the high school?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4395.757s">You</a> don't teach Latin at high school?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4398.799s">So</a> what are the three languages, again, that are taught at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4401.535s">Spanish,</a> Italian, and French. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4403.396s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4775.674s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4776.974s">For</a> the 36 students who took AP, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4781.338s">12,</a> 12, and 12, so Spanish.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6503.761s">The</a> scenario where someone would start at the Brooks, then go to the Roberts, and then go to the neighborhood school, do we actually do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6509.344s">Because</a> I've been at the Roberts, and it was my understanding that if the child started at the Roberts in third and newcomers, they did stay through for fourth and fifth.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6519.529s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6520.009s">That</a> I did not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6521.23s">So</a> how many would you say students a year leave the Brooks or the Roberts to go back to their neighborhood school from the newcomers program?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6603.95s">that</a> I know were in other school districts' neighborhoods, they've all stayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6607.872s">And</a> granted, that's maybe going back a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6610.354s">I'm</a> thinking of certain friends of some of my children. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6613.396s">So</a> I don't know if it was a parent's request to stay at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6616.297s">I</a> don't know if there's a back story. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6618.019s">Do</a> you know, Mr. Bosco?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6770.24s">Because</a> I think this is a conversation that we're having a lot with parents at different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6776.024s">So</a> there are currently five teachers at the McGlynn Middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6780.267s">Two</a> for newcomers? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6781.447s">Four.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6783.329s">Okay,</a> so two for newcomers.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6813.739s">Is</a> it possible that two teachers would stay at the book lab? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6816.961s">One</a> would have newcomers grades six, seven, and eight, and one would have?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6878.41s">So</a> if we just, so I can have <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6882.012s">answers</a> to parents' questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6883.513s">If</a> we duplicated the same exact middle school model at the Andrews, you would need four, you'd have to keep four at the McGlenn, and you'd need four at the Andrews.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6908.558s">but</a> then we would run into moving the kids from the Andrews back to the McLintock. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6912.339s">So</a> how many teachers would you need if you needed newcomers at both? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6916.66s">Would</a> it then be seven?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6918.92s">Eight,</a> okay.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9845.517s">Just</a> so we all know how you did it.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9853.061s">Okay,</a> so you would do a percent of the number of fifth graders in each of the four elementary schools?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11180.433s">However,</a> I'm sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11188.055s">Tuesday.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11837.623s">I</a> hear you, but I think we get emails often from parents that you've referenced tonight, the after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11844.128s">So</a> I almost feel like Paul's taking the weight off my own shoulders by saying it's not something we want to do, because I do get texts regularly from friends who are also parents in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11856.937s">And</a> I think we've gotten a number of emails that all of us have shared here that if parents have a concern or a resident, we can bring it and say, we got this email from this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11865.984s">So</a> I second. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11867.499s">Paul's</a> motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11871.142s">Oh,</a> sorry, Paulette.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11872.843s">Oh,</a> she thirds it.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11960.516s">I</a> mean, they can email us the next day and we can bring it up at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11967.878s">It's</a> not honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11968.699s">It</a> doesn't feel honest to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11970.139s">And</a> I am totally guilty of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11972.52s">For</a> the past two years, people have texted me and I've brought up issues that people have texted me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11976.622s">And</a> it felt yucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11978.102s">And</a> I never even thought of going this route with Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11980.764s">I</a> respect him for addressing this.<h2><a href="../2018-05-09_bCMsj8WYK14/2018-05-09_bCMsj8WYK14.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 7, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6311.842s">I</a> don't know about everyone, but likewise, I thought someone who was in administration was going to step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6317.439s">not</a> realizing that's not in their contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6319.92s">So</a> when we did receive multiple angry emails that night and the next morning, I did respond saying, I went in assuming, shame on me, that someone in administration would step into that role per contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6332.726s">The</a> other option was that the Massachusetts Association School Committees can take someone almost like an emergency superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6339.99s">So</a> to me, having a middle man or middle woman come in for eight weeks, try to transition, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6345.968s">while</a> we have, I almost feel like Dr. Maurice is like the Phoenix out of the ashes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6350.451s">Like</a> this is going to be a whole new public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6354.873s">And</a> I did not think that was the best choice to have a middle person. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6359.116s">Um,</a> but I think Mr. Bellson is, has the knowledge and the history to give our new superintendent and just looking forward that we needed that transition to be smoothly done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6371.363s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6372.938s">I</a> know people don't agree with that, but I think it would have been more detrimental to our school system to bring someone in for eight weeks, and I stand by that decision.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8300.12s">I</a> just want to say, a parent did email the next day and say, you definitely need to put in the new deputy superintendent's contract that they will step in so that <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8311.467s">We</a> have to add that because that isn't currently in the contract, so that doesn't work, which I was, it's a shame on me that I didn't read their contract to know that they did not have to be asked or forced into taking that superintendent's job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8328.62s">So</a> that's, we can add that to make sure the next deputy superintendent is their job.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9254.5s">Mr.</a> Superintendent.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9750.382s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9750.582s">Mustone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9751.823s">Back</a> in January, when our meeting was in the media studio, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9756.619s">And</a> the McGlynn teachers spoke about their improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9761.862s">Someone</a> mentioned almost, I don't want to call it gifted and talented because that's not what they called it, but it was, does this sound familiar to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9771.287s">And</a> they were saying that could be a way to attract that if you spoke to the four elementary school principals and said maybe you could, kids who want to be pushed more, or kids whose parents want to push them more, maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9784.017s">it</a> was talked about having a program at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9786.718s">Does</a> that sound familiar to anyone else?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9791.421s">No,</a> this wasn't a club. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9792.461s">This</a> was a curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9796.383s">They</a> would be tracked, more or less.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10052.265s">More</a> suggestion or just to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10055.487s">So</a> if we did move half the ELL students to the Andrews, the numbers would be equal.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10110.027s">So</a> with the Roberts, we had the program grades one through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10113.889s">You</a> had the newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10114.83s">And</a> for a few years, we were maxed on physical space. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10118.912s">So</a> this year, grades one and two went to the Brooks, Roberts retained three, four, and five. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10123.935s">And</a> I haven't heard much feedback one way or the other, but it freed up physical space in our building at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10134.783s">just</a> thinking of the 50 families, well, or 29, who end up not getting what they desired in our school choice, and if you, the Andrews used to have an ELL program, and we had the staffing for it, maybe that's a way to, and Justin, I guess Justin is what made me think of it, is that you don't want the McGlynn to be almost stigmatized, and if the Andrews has it as well, then we're helping there too.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10169.455s">Oh,</a> good.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10190.62s">I</a> know, but we're going to get our hands dirty one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10193.242s">Either</a> we're going to have 29 really angry families, or we're going to be dirty our hands with staffing with ELL.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10284.394s">Oh,</a> I understand if we have to hire four additional teachers.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10592.36s">suggested</a> that Mr. Tucci is debating on whether he would like to stay as principal?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10606.711s">But</a> it's not like you said, by Friday, so we can tell the public that the McGlynn will have a principal in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10611.494s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10630.53s">I</a> think that would be helpful.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=711.328s">Next</a> on the agenda is the buildings and grounds subcommittee report, which I am the chair of. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=716.392s">So</a> in the interest of time, because we were delayed starting this meeting, we had a committee of the whole meeting before this about the superintendent search. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=724.838s">I</a> am going to briefly talk about some highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=727.199s">We</a> did have a very productive meeting with 23 people at attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=731.542s">They</a> were principals, administrators, parents, school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=735.752s">Once</a> we vote on this, this will be online so you can read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=739.377s">It</a> does include highlights that every principal of every school had sent to me of what they've done since that February. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=748.891s">meeting</a> asking for some updates to security that had been questioned and then some proposals or suggestions that people gave to us that we are looking into now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=762.886s">One</a> is that to re-evaluate the STARS program, Alice has been <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=770.393s">looked</a> into and we're still moving forward in seeing how ALICE works in the school system with professional development and the cost, but also was suggested by the teacher union president to re-evaluate STARS. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=783.941s">Number</a> two, someone talked about in our schools, the doors <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=789.383s">can</a> only be opened on one side, so they sell these magnetic strips that are $3.25 that you would put on the classroom door, so that your door, you can go in and out, except when, unfortunately, if there was a time that we would have to have a lockdown, the magnetic strip would come off. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=804.166s">So</a> the teacher wouldn't have to unlock the door from one side. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=807.287s">I</a> don't understand it unless I have to get out and see the classroom door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=811.668s">Three</a> was additional adjustment Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=814.409s">Four</a> was a safety committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=816.649s">and</a> each school, not just a district-wide safety committee, but each school because they are such different physical plants and they have their own concerns that each school should have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=827.373s">Five</a> was classroom keys in the main office for substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=832.095s">That</a> is a concern that I don't know if it was a teacher or a principal had brought to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=837.27s">that</a> if a substitute is in, if there was a lockdown situation, they wouldn't have the keys. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=844.935s">Number</a> six was number on all the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=848.038s">So</a> if the fire department is called, all the doors, both internally and externally, would be numbered. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=854.302s">So</a> if the teacher's on the inside and is down one hallway, they can say what door they're at, and that same exit door would be on the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=862.848s">Number</a> 7 would be additional method police officers assigned to schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=867.309s">8</a> was additional social and emotional training for all staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=871.55s">9</a> was additional walkie-talkies. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=874.051s">10</a> was keyless entry for staff and faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=877.572s">What</a> it was described to me was almost a tap card and that would be to end the main <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=884.854s">building</a> the front doors itself because right now custodians are the ones who let teachers in who arrive early. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=891.676s">It</a> could be for hallways, it could be for classrooms, so tap cards I think is the more casual language. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=898.257s">11</a> is security training for both the before school staff and the after school staff and the early childhood staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=905.699s">12</a> was to have a standing security concern agenda item on the buildings and grounds subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=914.381s">13</a> was information for new students. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=917.002s">This</a> was brought by a city employee that said if a student, if we do drills, say in the fall, and a student transfers to our school mid-year, to have, to make sure that new orientation for students, that they're up to date with what their safety protocol would be at their school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=937.372s">Number</a> 14 is emergency kits for lockdown situations that teachers would have in their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=944.397s">And</a> 15 was to make sure suggestions for children who have an IEP that services they would need during a lockdown is included on their IEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=956.386s">If</a> you have any questions, please feel free <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=959.887s">to</a> email me, and this, after we discuss it, will be posted for, you can see what every school has been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=967.094s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=967.274s">DiBenedetto.</a>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1666.95s">Is</a> there a second for the motion to do a study to see how many people use the pool door during school hours, and maybe it'd be a better resource to use it at the rope door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1674.553s">Motion,</a> second by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1676.274s">Kreatz.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1679.035s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1685.197s">To</a> see if the pool door, if people are using it as frequently during the school hours as the people who are trying to be <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1693.77s">in</a> the vocational door for services of the different shops.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1845.76s">So</a> right now, I think it's allocating the resource of the pool door person and the vocation person. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1850.861s">I</a> think that's the immediate need that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1853.382s">Kreatz</a> is hearing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1854.422s">So</a> I think that should be the report right now so we can get that moving forward.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1898.674s">So</a> we have a motion to find out the use of the both doors and allocate the resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1906.644s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1907.184s">Relative</a> traffic patterns both in the interest of time, because I do know that we did still start <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1913.111s">20</a> minutes late. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1913.671s">There</a> are some amazing students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1915.892s">Could</a> someone have a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1917.373s">Motion.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1923.195s">So</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1923.615s">Van</a> De Koop made a motion to take the agenda items out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1926.296s">So</a> we can go to the vote on it first.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1942.313s">Six</a> yes, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1943.715s">I</a> want to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1944.576s">Rodriguez</a> for letting us jump ahead of her report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1948.64s">So</a> the first report on the Scholastic Art Awards.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2194.203s">Next</a> we have the Scholastic Writing Awards and Mrs. Chiesa will come up to present those.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2329.889s">All</a> right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2330.709s">Do</a> the teachers want to come up? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2332.61s">Come</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2333.691s">The</a> kids wouldn't be here without the teachers.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2522.121s">Do</a> the teachers want to say anything?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2556.546s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2557.227s">Motion</a> to accept the report on Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2562.209s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2564.53s">I'm</a> enthusiastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2571.413s">Thank</a> you, students. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2574.034s">Just</a> to go back to, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2577.195s">We're</a> going back to the agenda item <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2579.84s">Yes,</a> we next have the Committee of the Whole Minutes for March 29, 2018.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2599.573s">That</a> is a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2600.554s">I</a> wish I had to teach you, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2602.755s">So</a> motioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2603.416s">So</a> motioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2604.056s">I</a> ask you to assume committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2605.917s">We</a> did sort of do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2607.018s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2607.879s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2608.059s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2609.405s">So</a> I, but no, to make it official. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2612.568s">No</a> real call, but it's placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2614.669s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2615.07s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2616.531s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2617.652s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2620.214s">I'm</a> on the job learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2623.116s">So</a> next is the committee of the whole minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2626.259s">Make</a> a motion to accept.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2655.175s">Is</a> there a paragraph that talks about a new employee in here?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2732.425s">So</a> a motion to report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2733.385s">June</a> 1st.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2747.268s">Mr.</a> Russo, a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2748.549s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2807.173s">Point</a> of clarification from the Department of Finance.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2892.662s">Okay,</a> so would the motion be for July?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2916.543s">So</a> February and July? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2917.764s">Is</a> that more accurate?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2954.048s">Is</a> there a second for that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2956.63s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3106.473s">So</a> there is a motion for a payroll report twice a year around the time of February and July. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3112.657s">Is</a> there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3113.877s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3114.398s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3114.558s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3114.698s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3115.558s">Roll</a> call vote.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3120.681s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3136.977s">And</a> that report will now be online because it has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3141.199s">We</a> have to accept it.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3242.851s">Volunteers</a> update. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3244.172s">Do</a> you want me? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3244.872s">I</a> would love it.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3284.036s">So</a> motion to accept the committee of the whole.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3288.099s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3288.919s">So</a> moved.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3305.579s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3306.539s">And</a> placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3307.68s">And</a> Mayor Burke? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3308.96s">Absent.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3312.101s">So</a> moving on to agenda item number six, community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3315.703s">Cheryl</a> Rodriguez is here to speak, and I do want to thank her for <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3321.698s">letting</a> the scholastic awards go before her on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3326.34s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3327.421s">OK,</a> Cheryl.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3381.055s">But</a> on a different topic.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3412.172s">How</a> do I do that one?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3625.739s">I</a> thank you for being here, and I know you said you looked into the Michigan model, because that is something that the school committee had adopted a few years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3632.365s">Have</a> you found any curriculums that are specific to social media bullying? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3636.323s">Would</a> you say that's the?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3654.515s">Would</a> you mind emailing us?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3658.677s">So</a> would you suggest each school set up their own committee for addressing <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3665.023s">Is</a> it bullying all around or would you say you're really pinpointing social media?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3773.628s">Was</a> it under a subcommittee when <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3775.957s">You</a> did it in 2010 with Ann Marie?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3956.428s">We</a> have Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3956.928s">Kreatz,</a> then Sebastian, then Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3958.769s">DiBenedetto,</a> and Mr. Musso.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4006.207s">And</a> hopefully this, I think this issue is something that could be taken up on a subcommittee and that could be a suggestion that is flushed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4014.43s">Sebastian?</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4055.544s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4057.142s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4057.322s">D.</a> Benedetto.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4192.586s">Or</a> a full committee of the whole.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4248.635s">So</a> there's a motion to get the rates of these forms that are being, I don't know, where do the principals, do the principals send them somewhere once they fill them out?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4403.31s">Something</a> to do with music.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4444.245s">So</a> we have, just to make the key points so far, so Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4450.427s">Kreatz</a> had suggested the phone line. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4453.808s">Sebastian</a> suggested, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4456.036s">looking</a> at the policy again and updating it.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4464.622s">Yes,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4467.024s">Paul,</a> Mr. Russo, did you have a suggestion?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4478.513s">So</a> just asking the principals how many forms they fill out a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4481.275s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4582.835s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4663.294s">So</a> hold on Mr. Nelson. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4665.515s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4764.531s">I</a> think when it trickles back into the school day, that's the issue.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4803.728s">We</a> do need a committee of the whole.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4885.357s">So</a> Mr. Ruggiero made a motion to make this issue a committee of the whole for social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4892.322s">I</a> think it's a wide net. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4894.484s">So</a> is there a second?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4938.806s">And</a> if we try to... After the superintendent is hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4942.267s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4942.467s">I'll</a> accept that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4943.167s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4944.648s">So,</a> we will have a committee of the whole... After the superintendent search is completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4951.349s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Johnson.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4974.515s">Next</a> is the report on professional development, Alice Feedback.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5104.767s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5105.087s">Are</a> there questions for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5106.168s">Caldwell?</a>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8409.598s">So</a> I want to clarify your motion to get a second.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8445.881s">Yes,</a> I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8453.602s">So</a> the motion is for the next agenda, which our meeting, our next meeting is May. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8459.966s">May.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8461.607s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8462.768s">In</a> May. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8463.268s">In</a> May. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8464.108s">We</a> will put on the agenda transition plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8467.09s">All</a> those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8469.912s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8471.493s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8471.633s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8504.058s">So</a> make a motion that if there is a police report that's finished, that it will be shared at our next meeting.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8578.204s">Just</a> transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8581.292s">for</a> the May agenda to have a report, if there is one, or whatever update, there might be no update on the agenda for our May meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8589.495s">Who's</a> to second? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8591.256s">Mr.</a> Russo seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8592.497s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8593.837s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8594.738s">Placed</a> on five. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8596.411s">So</a> coming to the end is report on Metro Public Schools after school programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8601.914s">That</a> was, I think we all received the same email that a mom rightfully concerned that the after school program is full. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8609.479s">But</a> I looked quickly at the books and she wanted to see how the school committee could help improve the numbers or the capacity for after school programs.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8751.951s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero, I have a question.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8947.615s">Move</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8950.937s">Place</a> on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8952.678s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8954.619s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8960.854s">Okay,</a> can we hold just for just condolences and congratulations?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8992.416s">So</a> we will start with happy news. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8994.617s">Congratulations</a> to Denise Chiesa, the school committee executive assistant on the marriage of her daughter Alexandra to Arthur Turani this past weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9004.462s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9008.677s">And</a> we do have two condolences, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Shirley Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9017.479s">Mrs.</a> Carr was a former account clerk at the vocational school and the wife of retired Medford Police Detective Patrick Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9024.601s">Also</a> be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Robert Harrington. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9031.338s">Mr.</a> Harrington was a long time teacher at the Curtis Tough School. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9034.864s">If</a> we could take a moment of silence for these two individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9063.754s">And</a> I have to make the announcement we are not going back out. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=9065.976s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-04-05_TayqV05M2I0/2018-04-05_TayqV05M2I0.html">Medford School Committee - Superintendent Interviews - Night 2 - 04/04/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=972.085s">So</a> this is two parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=973.366s">One</a> is, what do you think is the primary function of a superintendent nowadays with so many shifting educational requirements? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=982.75s">And</a> how would you implement your first steps for this priority if you were to be our superintendent?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1077.511s">First</a> steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1078.212s">So</a> if you were to be superintendent, what do you think your first steps would be in the new role?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3823.844s">So</a> another big concern of parents that I received emails is about the upkeep <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3829.167s">and</a> maintenance of our school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3831.789s">So</a> do you have experience with budget for upkeep and maintenance, or is that something that you see in your current BPS? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3841.636s">Is</a> that something you've dealt with before with your schools that you are the superintendent of?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3915.634s">So</a> is there a line budget item that says grounds?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4005.961s">And</a> I know you've had many different roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4008.202s">Have</a> you had in one of your roles the responsibility to write a whole school budget and what was that like for you or how did it play out?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.206s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.786s">Well,</a> I guess could I just follow up with that, just because you had mentioned community partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4109.328s">Can</a> you speak about partnerships that you've created or that you would like to see created in Medford that aren't currently here?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7783.941s">Nice</a> to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7784.881s">Very</a> good to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7786.722s">So</a> I guess my basic question is, what do you see as the primary role of the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7792.545s">And</a> then following that, how would you take, what would your first steps be if you were to be the next Medford superintendent?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7924.078s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-04-05_O8bUu4AaRl4/2018-04-05_O8bUu4AaRl4.html">Medford School Committee - Superintendent Interviews - Night 1 - 04/02/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=296.203s">I</a> would say if you've googled Medford school system, you probably got a lot of articles about communication within the district with parents, with teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=306.11s">So</a> if you could talk about how you communicate with teachers, administrators, parents, and everyone, and children, and the students, that would be, I would love to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=315.917s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=483.77s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1878.223s">preschool</a> education, except that it seems like a lot of front lines of newspapers is that four-year-olds should have a universal full-day program. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1887.09s">So</a> I know in Boston it's K1 and K2. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1889.672s">I</a> don't know about North Andover or if it's something you're interested in, if you think it's something we could do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1894.856s">I</a> know parents have asked me quite often about a four-year-old program. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1899.019s">So</a> your thoughts, early childhood?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2019.877s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2020.657s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.738s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.918s">Kritz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2023.078s">Hi.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4151.896s">I</a> just have one more question.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4153.316s">Another</a> concern of many parents is the physical space in a capital plan for upkeep. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4159.637s">So</a> our elementary schools and our middle schools are still new. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4164.038s">It's</a> 13 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4166.959s">But</a> have you worked with the capital plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4168.599s">How</a> do you address the building needs, the upkeep, the maintenance? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4173.18s">That's</a> something that comes up often. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4176.24s">with</a> our buildings?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4310.879s">Were</a> you part of the writing team for the <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4314.081s">Middle</a> school application.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4317.907s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6688.177s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6689.042s">Turn</a> this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6690.783s">So</a> I did learn through your resume that you have middle school and high school experience, but we do have four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6696.869s">So</a> if you could talk some concerns you have, both your strengths with elementary are tying it in, or concerns of now heading a school system K through 12.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6821.171s">Can</a> I follow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6822.172s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6824.033s">So</a> about early childhood, a lot of surrounding towns are talking about a four-year-old full day, calling it K1, pre-K, K2. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6833.421s">So</a> I don't know if you have thoughts on that or if you see how that could work here in MedFed or if you've <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6839.983s">have</a> a plan?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6866.603s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6867.203s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.744s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.945s">Kritz.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8534.2s">You</a> had used the phrase you're an outsider with an insider view. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8540.308s">So</a> with that inside view, what would you say is the Medford Public Schools greatest strength and greatest weakness and how would you address the weakness?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8672.128s">Just</a> to follow up on that, I know that we've exchanged emails that I had met with the two community directors for Medford and Somerville, and that I was unaware that any student can audit a class that would be high school credit, not Tufts credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8686.095s">And</a> that the woman, Barbara Rugal, said she's had one most of the time, at most a year three. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8692.579s">And</a> that is something that they are eager to get more partnership going. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8697.161s">So</a> I'm not saying that.<h2><a href="../2018-03-20_3N-X2ResFqI/2018-03-20_3N-X2ResFqI.html">School Committee meeting March 19, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5111.453s">I</a> just want to share with people at home that the Medford Community Coalition had emailed the school committee and other members in central administration about suggestions they had for communication and safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5129.086s">So</a> I just want to clarify for them that one of their suggestions was <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5134.478s">to</a> find out if a training was happening with Alice, what's hopefully the timeline so we can say hopefully a professional development day in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5143.68s">But</a> this is just a short one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5145.38s">Yeah,</a> an intro is March 21st and then further on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5148.801s">Their</a> other suggestion was about the safety advisory committee that we had spoken about that is going to fall under the building and grounds subcommittee, which I chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5157.962s">And</a> we did set a date, thank God, for Doodle. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5161.195s">So</a> our safety advisory committee first meeting will be Thursday night, March 22nd from 7 to 9 at the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5169.902s">It</a> will be posted tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5171.524s">Everyone</a> is welcome to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5175.087s">And</a> then their other suggestion was just having streamlined communication, which is something that is being addressed and working on with central administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5184.234s">So</a> I want to thank the Method Community Coalition for giving us those great suggestions.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5196.256s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5196.656s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5241.789s">I</a> can second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5242.47s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5528.55s">And</a> I guess we'll find out more once we go through training. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5534.033s">But</a> a friend of mine works in a different district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5536.923s">She</a> was only trained once for ALICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5540.525s">So</a> it's almost, I don't think you'd have to use a professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5543.987s">It</a> would be for new hires, maybe during their new hire orientation, they would be trained for ALICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5549.21s">She</a> was trained once three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5550.611s">She's</a> still a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5551.531s">So</a> I don't know if it's something that you have to be trained, it's the same training year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5557.114s">So</a> that's something we can look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5558.475s">So</a> it might not be, it could be part of that week of orientation for new teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5564.765s">Because</a> I don't, but we'll have to clarify if you have to be retrained every year.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5626.386s">So</a> the meeting when you were in Colorado, the chief supported it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5631.688s">A</a> young man who was an EMT spoke about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5635.289s">And</a> a mother of three children who professionally is an ALICE trainer spoke very eloquently about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5641.932s">So</a> that's how it came.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5998.364s">So</a> I know we at the Roberts have an adjustment Councilor that is great and works nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6006.75s">So</a> she does the social, emotional well-being part. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6010.053s">Are</a> you suggesting a guidance council for elementary for more academic part? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6014.217s">I'm</a> just not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6015.298s">Just</a> to think of staffing.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6053.384s">Does</a> the high school have adjustment Councilors?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6058.806s">And</a> who does the adjustment Councilors, what department does it fall under? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6061.727s">Special</a> education. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6062.687s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6063.248s">So</a> that's another budget that we'll hear about.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3123.391s">One</a> literacy?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3154.035s">So</a> that almost makes up the difference? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3155.596s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3156.277s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3157.598s">And</a> then with the other options, so the plan is not to pick renaissance this year, but to try the <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3169.072s">Fountas,</a> Pinnell, are the words their way next year to pilot?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3197.437s">Okay,</a> and then the comments, were they from a survey that all the grade one teachers took? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3201.922s">I</a> don't know where the comments came from.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3208.605s">And</a> all the grade one teachers were part of the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3211.626s">Every</a> single one of them, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3212.587s">Oh,</a> that's great.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3220.971s">So</a> we don't have to move yet on Renaissance, because from the comments, it doesn't seem like it's supported by many teachers.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3246.803s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3247.744s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3248.004s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3248.724s">You're</a> welcome.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=270.807s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=271.388s">So</a> for those of you who were not at our last meeting, Cheryl Rodriguez, a mother from the Roberts, had come to explain to us that she was applying for a CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=281.475s">Community</a> Preservation Act grant for the Roberts Playground surface area, which is very torn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=287.36s">It</a> would fall under both recreation and open space of the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=291.323s">The</a> other two categories are affordable housing and historical site. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=296.147s">So</a> she was looking for us to support her in her round two of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=300.75s">She</a> made it through the first round. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=301.891s">Cheryl's</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=302.512s">I'm</a> not making sure everything I'm saying is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=306.275s">So</a> it was moved to our subcommittee where we, the three of us, it was, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=311.171s">Kathy,</a> myself, and Erin, and that we recommend that the school committee allows her to move forward with looking for these CPA funds for the Roberts.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1540.047s">But</a> I'm saying when a teacher takes this, the way to do it, the AD English isn't going to be part of this package. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1547.091s">They</a> have to go to the website and look up the AD regulations?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1575.98s">Right,</a> but I'm saying if you have a checklist and all the forms that you need are part of this package, wouldn't the ADA regulations make sense just to have them part of this package so you don't have to go to a computer to look up the regulations?

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5763.95s">for</a> a minute just to make a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5767.712s">Kathy,</a> I spoke to Kathy, a parent emailed that there is currently not a behaviorist at the Glen Elementary, our middle school, and there are children who are on IVs who have it in their IV for behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5780.14s">So</a> I know you're interviewing currently, but if there's something we can do to help get it moving, I don't know if we can subcontract with the company until someone's hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5792.297s">But</a> the parent is very concerned that there's not a behaviorist at that school.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5859.929s">And</a> I'm unclear of the roles of everyone, but in the McGlynn, they said the adjustment Councilor is doing some of what a behaviorist would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5867.811s">So</a> is the adjustment Councilor the same schooling as a behaviorist? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5871.351s">OK,</a> so a BCBA is an analyst.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5913.63s">And</a> is there a shortage of behaviorists in our area?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5979.947s">Is</a> our salary comparable to areas around us for our behaviorists?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5985.161s">And</a> have you had any leads?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5996.083s">And</a> in the meantime, you're confident that kids are all getting their services met, that we don't need a subcontractor for behaviors?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6022.488s">So</a> the three that we have, one's full-time at the Roberts, one's shared between the Andrews and the Columbus? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6027.793s">Excuse</a> me.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6079.743s">We</a> have Island Buckley's up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6082.024s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6083.084s">So</a> then has the one that's housed at the Columbus or the one that's housed at the Roberts gone to the McGlynn?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6103.082s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6103.422s">So</a> just so we're all on the same page, what I'm hearing is that the one at the Roberts is at the Roberts, doesn't go anywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6110.064s">The</a> one at the Andrews and the Columbus only goes to the Andrews and the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6113.245s">There</a> must be one at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6114.245s">I</a> didn't know anything about that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6116.346s">So</a> that the McGlynn doesn't have a behaviorist, that the person, the kid's IEPs, what they're asking, the adjustment Councilor is doing what typically the behaviorist would be doing.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6175.512s">But</a> I don't know how we can help. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6176.733s">I</a> mean, it's been a few months since the person left, and I'm just wondering, what can we do to attract people here better?<h2><a href="../2017-10-20_c9BkgpEV0c8/2017-10-20_c9BkgpEV0c8.html">Medford Mayoral and School Committee Candidates Forum 10/12/17</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5425.922s">And</a> the same with that in the EL classes, are we looking for September of 2018 to <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5431.885s">move</a> half the EL to the Andrews?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5451.42s">And</a> then, I don't know, because it's been 20 months, so it might have happened before I was on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5457.125s">I</a> was assigned to the Roberts for my children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5459.367s">And</a> then I did not choose the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5461.369s">I</a> love the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5462.15s">I</a> can't say enough about Mr. Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5464.071s">But</a> then I get to pick middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5465.833s">Why</a> don't we just assign <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5468.522s">families</a> to one or the other middle school, so you don't have kids who are on a wait list.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5492.82s">But</a> I don't choose elementary, so weren't they built with the memo?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5556.264s">Right,</a> but it's not, to the family at home with a preschooler, no one thinks that we're a choice system. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5563.409s">Everyone</a> thinks you go to the school closest to your house.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5569.534s">You</a> grant them.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5619.692s">I</a> know, but we're not, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5621.413s">Selling</a> ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5622.334s">I</a> don't go in with my four-year-old and say Roberts number one Columbus number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5627.417s">I</a> don't there's really not a choice system So let's know unless you make the request you're going to write your school or you register your child.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5645.97s">Right,</a> who are in the know to write a letter or an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5649.192s">But</a> when you go to register your child, it doesn't say you get to choose the elementary school you want to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5653.954s">They</a> say to me, you live on Morgan Ave, you go to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5656.976s">And</a> unless you are informed or active on Facebook Medford Moms, you don't know that you can choose what school to go to.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5676.822s">Right,</a> but if we are, if for middle school you get a choice, one or two, but we don't get that for elementary school, I'm just saying then why do we give a choice at the middle school?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5695.5s">Not</a> if we do a random lottery for kids going to middle school.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5714.905s">No,</a> because you said, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5717.117s">The</a> McGlynn used to be the choice school, and they had over-enrollment.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5973.474s">When</a> was the last time you redistricted? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5975.275s">One</a> at a time please.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6693.973s">With</a> the federal funding, you said they had to be schools with a similar student population. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6698.277s">Not</a> federal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6699.358s">What</a> did you say about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6700.319s">Oh,</a> state. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6701.039s">State,</a> sorry, not federal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6702.601s">But</a> how does the Andrews have 20% low and reduced?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6709.567s">But</a> 20% to 44% for that subgroup is pretty big.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7189.47s">Can</a> I just say, is Lumiere less than 150 units?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7193.153s">So</a> is Lumiere one of those addresses? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7194.675s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7194.835s">I</a> just don't know what the address is.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7244.656s">Can</a> we just go back to the buildings, just because I don't know the addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7247.978s">So</a> 100 Rivers Edge Drive, where's that?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7258.766s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7259.027s">3,600</a> Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7260.127s">Is</a> that behind the old Malden Mall? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7262.829s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7263.39s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7265.757s">And</a> that 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7288.496s">And</a> then the boat that's station landing, and then Riverside Ave.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7295.834s">Near</a> La Conte Rink, is that?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8061.812s">Kristina,</a> just on the first page, the third paragraph, the last one, the undistributed unemployment, is that one employee, or is that a number of employees?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8072.854s">Okay,</a> and is that, so it's 72,000, is that accurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8078.496s">Is</a> that a typical year for unemployment?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8318.424s">From</a> our Mustang Seors, keep on galloping!

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1410.817s">What</a> page? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1411.497s">I</a> can't hear you, Erin.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2052.796s">with</a> enrollment, and I don't know if this might be for Diane Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2057.876s">For</a> last year, we have last year district enrollment for 9.916 compared to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2063.218s">So</a> the only for the high school vocational last year was 13.65, this year is 13.50, so that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2071.7s">The</a> Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School were 9.46, now we're 9.38. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2076.161s">The</a> one that I'm just curious if you have any insight is the total for the four elementary last year were 18.92, and this year was 16.08, a difference of 284. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2086.444s">Is</a> that something with our demographics or I don't know if that seems like such a big bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2096.783s">The</a> 16th.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2101.285s">I</a> can't hear anybody.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2106.827s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2107.847s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2108.208s">You</a> got it.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2586.764s">We</a> found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2587.604s">It</a> was the missing kindergarten column.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4567.736s">I</a> feel like we're at two different meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4569.598s">What</a> was the answer?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4820.693s">Christine,</a> do you have an estimate of how many of our school children take buses? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4825.594s">Or</a> could you get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4826.615s">I'm</a> curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4827.395s">You</a> know, at the Roberts, I try to encourage as many parents because it's such a traffic nightmare of how many students use our buses.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4884.236s">next</a> few weeks
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4894.587s">But</a> five of mine take the bus, and I filled out five forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4897.949s">So</a> there is a form with the child's name on it in each of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4901.292s">So</a> I'm just curious of what percent of each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4904.674s">I</a> understand that some kids take it two mornings a week and three afternoons a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4908.336s">But</a> even if we got an estimate of numbers, that'd be great.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4913.119s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5354.593s">So</a> is that the list you use when you make the robocalls from school grades?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5359.538s">So</a> that's what I think Kathy's asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5361.72s">So</a> does the parent just go online and change the information or do they call the school secretary?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5829.045s">So</a> when you, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5831.906s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5832.106s">Mestone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5833.046s">So</a> when you came here to the Parent Information Center to enroll your children, were they all set to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5838.248s">Yes,</a> they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5838.848s">So</a> then what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5839.929s">I'm</a> just confused of how it all went down.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5887.324s">So</a> I don't know the law, but isn't it wherever you lie your head the most is where you go to school? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5893.207s">But</a> it seems like the court order isn't live.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8697.802s">He's</a> laughing because he knows.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8701.245s">I</a> can't.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8706.028s">So</a> I just remember when the dress code came up between the Andrews and the McGlenn and how they were so different. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8712.252s">So</a> in the handbook at the elementary, like every elementary has their own handbook, the two middle school have their own handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8718.957s">Will</a> this just be cut and pasted into it, or is this like an addendum to the part that it already speaks about the dress code in the different handbooks?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8924.737s">So</a> the current ones are all getting removed.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8927.217s">The</a> current ones are all being removed and this will be the same.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10954.176s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10957.946s">I</a> just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10958.867s">I</a> was surprised at the under the behavior system that all the information now that we have at our fingertips that there were 278 suspensions and I was just hoping you could give me a report at some time in the near future if that's <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10974.482s">One</a> student who may have been suspended 10 times, or that's 270 individual students that were suspended once. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10980.425s">I</a> was just surprised at that number.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11001.973s">Yeah,</a> I don't even know where it's right.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5982.463s">Mustone,</a> I was just wondering about the English language learner summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5987.6s">So</a> out of the newcomers at the Roberts and the newcomers at middle school and the newcomers at the high school, what percent would you say take advantage of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5994.949s">Because</a> that, I think, is a great program.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6005.349s">In</a> lunch and transportation, I would think you could get a hundred percent.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6034.479s">And</a> then on the special ed program, the last part is there's approximately 142 students requiring the various services. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6041.505s">Do</a> all 142 take advantage of these programs?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6058.136s">So</a> can I make a motion if Kathy could tell us what percent comes and if Trotter could tell us what percent comes to the... Sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6066.865s">Just</a> maybe if they're not 100%, maybe there's a way to outreach more to get more people to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6071.69s">Okay.</a>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3037.307s">Right,</a> but we've always heard that the Andrews was like our IT school to go to, but this is Sabbath and McGlynn.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3045.992s">So</a> even if we cut it in half, it still seems like it's substantially more.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3084.209s">Is</a> anyone else shocked though? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3085.909s">I'm</a> assuming that it's, we took a snapshot at about the same time at each school, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3091.75s">People</a> work, they probably worked seven to three in school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3095.471s">So</a> as a parent who's now worried about kids in their device usage at school as well as home, it seems <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3102.776s">So</a> the percentage-wise goes from 1% to 67%. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3106.861s">That</a> seems like a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3108.924s">And</a> I'm not an IT person, so I don't know what I'm missing.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3173.305s">Yeah,</a> we can we can get some comment Because then on page 8 from the beginning Finding one that we're paying internet connection at the high school and at the McGlynn And I know that I have heard that <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3188.564s">At</a> the Andrews, it's very slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3190.965s">They're</a> connection a lot of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3193.067s">So</a> why isn't a finding for the Andrews as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3195.828s">I</a> guess it would have been helpful to have a Tech Edge person here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3198.47s">So</a> we can bring them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3199.711s">We</a> can bring them in.

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5838.923s">All</a> right, so there's not any <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5841.968s">number</a> or specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5844.23s">So,</a> Kathy, I guess I can speak to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5845.571s">It's</a> legal.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5847.452s">My</a> fifth grader last year was in a classroom that had a full-time parent, the lead teacher, and then a part-time parent when the child was pulled in.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5913.647s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5914.967s">So</a> I can only talk about my Tegan's fourth grade year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5917.729s">So</a> she had one full-time para who helped four students in her class. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5923.453s">And</a> then the para came in part-time with a student that was pulled in for certain classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5927.515s">So</a> a teacher asked me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5929.871s">at</a> the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5931.452s">So</a> how many, so there's no number of like, you could have 10 kids who have, it would help to have a parent in one class with one?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5970.603s">Okay,</a> so then, I guess because this budget is all new to me, so if you come, I don't know, when you do your placements in August, so will there be maybe a possibility to be hiring more paras if a class or a grade has that many more needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5987.642s">Or</a> like is what we have as Paris done?

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=3470.311s">We</a> only pay for the bus if they were at the charter school was in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=3476.896s">So</a> if you're in Malden, you'd pay for the bus in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=3479.679s">We</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=3480.099s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nRt_3AXXILY/2025-03-21_nRt_3AXXILY.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Feb. 1, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4155.425s">I</a> think what Paulette was saying about parents being concerned, as a parent with five at the Roberts, I can say we have wonderful teachers, a dedicated principal, vice principal, and that I hope that you coming to the school will reassure parents that their education is still top notch in this test, however the equation <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4173.973s">it</a> doesn't reflect what the kids are getting in the classroom, because they've all had a great education with superb teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4180.575s">So</a> I want to reassure the people that this test is not what the Roberts is about.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=5581.388s">I</a> just, I don't know what number nine school choice costs refer to.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6123.283s">What's</a> the program that most of the kids from Medford go to Minuteman for currently?
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6138.16s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6138.78s">And</a> then, so if we chose not, the kids chose not to go to Midland, but they want to go to horticulture, that would be Essex agricultural.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_-NVTJszOr_U/2025-03-21_-NVTJszOr_U.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 25, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1518.274s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2597.516s">Miss</a> Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2599.158s">Thank</a> you both for being here, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2600.399s">Caldwell.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2600.959s">I</a> just wanted to see if you could just speak about how great it would be to have a full-time aide while you roll out this K through 2 grant program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2611.147s">It</a> seems like there's a lot of writing, which is hard to do with 20 kids with one adult.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4991.39s">And</a> the only thing that I want to ask about is that parents of preschoolers <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5003.205s">had</a> said it's difficult to learn the community or the culture, that information meetings are helpful, but it'd be almost nicer if they could go in during the school day to see a classroom in action where their child actually would be with the size, the teacher, the feel of the school.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_C0nvMKTnl38/2025-03-21_C0nvMKTnl38.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 11, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4336.929s">I</a> just want to, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4338.802s">Paulette,</a> I feel the same way about the kids at the Roberts because that's before my children are presently and they have friends who are the newcomers program. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4347.306s">And</a> Mr. Bellson, correct me if I'm wrong, a lot of times they've stayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4351.609s">So</a> they've come out of the newcomers program and come into our classrooms that they don't get shifted to the Brooks or the Columbus.
 <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4362.285s">So</a> I was just going to say, they don't all get shifted out.
