<h2><a href="../2025-10-30_sQqMa0Ysceo/2025-10-30_sQqMa0Ysceo.html">Medford Happenings Episode 29 Michael Marks and Robert Penta</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=222.128s">Yeah,</a> I mean, when I first got on the council, the council was known as the People's Forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=230.512s">It</a> truly was the only place in the city that residents can go up, and at the time it was once a week, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=238.575s">which</a> I think many people prefer that over every other week now, and residents could come up on a host of issues that impacted their daily life, and we as a council would open up, allow them to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=253.068s">You</a> know, we had rules regarding time, but if someone took their time out of their schedule to come up there, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=259.334s">We</a> were very gracious with allowing people to speak, and we never shut off people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=265.337s">I</a> think Bob can attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=267.198s">We</a> let people vent, and sometimes they just wanted to come up and vent, but we gave them a forum, and I think that's what's lacking now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=275.583s">Residents</a> are frustrated because they don't have a forum to speak, and when you get to speak, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=282.106s">You're</a> cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=283.067s">You're</a> rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=284.868s">Members</a> of the council, certain members, are very rude and condescending. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=289.793s">And</a> they really make people feel like they don't want to hear what they have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=294.897s">And</a> when you get rid of the only forum in the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=298.38s">I</a> think that says a lot that people have nowhere else to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=302.803s">And</a> in my opinion, if I was back in the council, that would be the first thing I would fight for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=309.587s">Increase</a> public participation, allowing residents to get up and vent any of their concerns, and make it truly the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=320.775s">And</a> that was, as you remember, Bob, Bob Mayorko used to say that all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=325.458s">This</a> is the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=327.439s">And,</a> you know, I always remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=329.14s">And</a> I said, you know what, this is the one place they get to come up and speak and be heard and, you know, by their elected officials and give them the opportunity.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=387.025s">And</a> if I could just add, John, they're using the agenda against residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=393.426s">And</a> when I say that, you could be on the agenda and not be heard for four or five hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=399.827s">And</a> to me, if you have a group of residents that come up all on the same issue, there's no reason that would have never happened under our watch, myself or Bob Penter or the other members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=411.616s">If</a> we knew there was a group of people there, we would always suspend the rules and allow them to speak first. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=418.08s">They</a> weren't waiting four or five hours to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=420.983s">Now</a> it's being used, the council agenda is being used as a tool to stifle people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=426.687s">And</a> that again is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=429.27s">In</a> my opinion, these are the things that we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=432.593s">There</a> were a host of changes that were made to the council rules, in my opinion, that do not benefit residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=441.5s">and</a> allow for public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=443.381s">And</a> the new council that comes in, hopefully, will change a lot of those rules back to allow for more public participation, allow for people to get up there in a timely fashion and speak, and move the issues along. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=456.59s">And</a> that's not happening right now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=524.465s">So</a> the major concern I hear right now, and there's a lot to zoning, if people don't know or not aware, zoning, in my opinion, is the lifeblood of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=535.773s">That's</a> the backbone of a community, how it's zoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=540.536s">And</a> I think what's currently happening right now is <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=543.358s">The</a> push from six members of the council, excluding George Scapelli, he's been very vocal about being opposed, not to zoning changes, but to the elimination of single family districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=558.707s">That's</a> going to have such a major impact on the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=563.85s">If</a> you look at the Lawrence estates, if you look at North Method, if you look throughout the community that have single family neighborhoods, the Brooks estates, and all of a sudden now zoning for single families is going to be gone and you're going to allow up to three, four, five units in each lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=583.763s">That</a> makes for high density housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=586.546s">It</a> makes for increased traffic, increased congestion, increased lack of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=594.052s">There's</a> a host of concerns that everyone in this community should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=599.737s">And</a> that's not to say we don't need additional housing, and in particular affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=605.679s">I</a> think Chapter 40B, which is the state law that provides for building with affordable housing, that does increase the stock of affordable housing in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=618.904s">Does</a> it do enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=620.365s">That's</a> up for debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=621.845s">But</a> right now, to change the fabric of this community, and let me just say, John, it doesn't just change single family areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=629.408s">I</a> live in Wellington, and it changes two family areas as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=634.489s">So</a> if you look at South Method, if you look at Wellington, Haines Square that has a lot of two families, they're talking about changing a two family into a four to six family. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=646.233s">And</a> think about it, that just doesn't impact your neighborhood, that impacts infrastructure, water and sewer, that impacts school size, class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=658.12s">There's</a> a lot of ramifications right now that I think every, that's the most pressing issue, I think every resident in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=667.089s">should</a> be concerned and should really pay attention to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=671.691s">And</a> in my opinion, I was elected 26 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=675.452s">By</a> far, this is probably the most important, crucial issue that faces this community right now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=838.418s">Can</a> I just add one thing, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=841.261s">Sure,</a> Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=841.942s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=842.622s">just</a> because it's important to know, I think, for the viewing audience, that this zoning initiative was on the fast track. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=851.545s">And</a> there were countless meetings and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=854.226s">And</a> people have spoken up that they were not just opposed to it, but they thought it required more investigation and more community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=866.149s">And</a> it wasn't until the election started to approach that this current city council, six members, put it on hold temporarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=876.613s">And</a> when I say temporarily, I mean temporarily, until after the election's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=882.215s">And</a> in my opinion, if we reelect six of those members, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=886.717s">This</a> zoning is going to fly through. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=888.378s">The</a> very fabric of the city is going to change a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=893.002s">So</a> we have a unique opportunity to stand up and say, you know what, we don't support this current zoning change. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=899.868s">We</a> do support taking a look at zoning and how we can improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=903.571s">But</a> we don't support this current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=905.631s">And</a> the only way I tell people all the time to send a message is to look at the candidates right now that are talking about, hey, let's take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=915.074s">Let's</a> carefully approach this zoning and see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=919.294s">And</a> if you look at George Scarpelli, Rick Caraviello, Patrick Lurken, Paul Donato Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=924.976s">has</a> spoken about it, Melody Tringali, Nate Merritt, Nick <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=933.279s">They've</a> all spoken about it, saying that they're definitely going to review this and take a much longer approach to make sure every neighborhood's accounted for when any change, and every input is accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=949.588s">So</a> I think that's key. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=951.109s">And</a> when I tell people, because we still get calls, Bob Penter can attest to this, I get calls all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=957.513s">And</a> I'll say what you probably do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=959.655s">If</a> people say, Mike, what do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=961.056s">And</a> I tell them, I say, you get the government you deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=964.599s">So</a> if you want to reelect the same people, you're going to get this, especially the zoning, jammed down your throat.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1043.9s">John,</a> not to belabor it, but one other point because this is an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1050.082s">Back</a> several years ago when I was on the council, there was the housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1055.303s">This</a> plan was commissioned by the city and we brought in a private consultant and they brought up creative ways in order for us to create more affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1065.405s">And</a> one of the major pieces was to look at, I believe at the time, there were some 300 and something odd lots in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1074.752s">And</a> most of them were under the buildable size that you can do in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1081.658s">And</a> at the time, the housing production plan was going to take these lots, either purchase the city or approach people that own these odd lots that can't build, and turn them into buildable lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1094.508s">for</a> affordable housing and give an incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1097.832s">And</a> so you're talking about a massive project, which would be another 300 or 400 additional affordable housing in the city on lots that are already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1109.745s">People</a> can actually sell their lot off if I had a little piece of lot and build affordable housing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1116.107s">And</a> there's been no consideration by this current council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1119.408s">They</a> only want to come in and create high density housing and just jam things into people's neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1125.49s">That's</a> not a way of doing it, John.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1175.971s">So</a> I understand this is somewhat of a contentious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1180.375s">And</a> when I was on the council, I was the first member of the council to bring forth a petition to be sent to the state legislature for a charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1192.488s">And</a> believe it or not, it passed four to three, I believe, at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1196.33s">It</a> went up to the statehouse and sat in the, I think it was the home rule or local affairs committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1203.054s">I</a> think it was the local affairs committee and sat there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1205.476s">And</a> we finally reached out after it was there for months and come to find out the chairman of the committee said he didn't think that the four to three vote was enough to move that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1217.382s">And,</a> you know, it's a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1219.863s">We</a> speak to the residents, you know, initiate this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1224.724s">But</a> needless to say, it died within the statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1229.925s">You</a> know, I support the two years worth of work that was done by a lot of good people in this community that sat. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1238.028s">They</a> had countless hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1239.968s">They</a> met with countless people, countless boards and commissions, and came out with what I think a good working document and something that, is it perfect? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1250.771s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1252.352s">But</a> at this point, I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1256.053s">And</a> I think we have a decent document to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1259.534s">And</a> for instance, WAD representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1262.215s">I've</a> always supported that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1264.236s">I</a> think it's important to make sure that every neighborhood, every ward has someone that you can say, hey, that's my city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1273.02s">I</a> see him three times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1274.921s">He</a> lives in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1276.742s">I</a> see him at Stop and Shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1279.623s">It's</a> really bringing the city back to a real small neighborhood level. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1284.465s">And</a> I think it's a good form of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1286.867s">So</a> I support most of what's in there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1291.051s">Am</a> I happy with everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1292.472s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1293.213s">But</a> this also calls for a periodic review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1299.138s">It</a> hasn't been looked at in 39 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1302.14s">and</a> I think this is a good start and hopefully it is just the starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1307.081s">So</a> I'm going to support it and I'm telling people that I know to give it a shot and then we can always look to tweak and improve going forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1356.638s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1357.939s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1359.56s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1360.28s">Does</a> that still work? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1361.601s">Point</a> of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1362.722s">Yeah,</a> it still works. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1364.082s">You</a> see how I got Bob to stop talking quick? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1366.704s">No,</a> but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1368.345s">Right</a> away, it went in his head. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1369.586s">He</a> said, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1370.606s">Yeah,</a> good memories, Michael.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1373.848s">So</a> I'm not advocating to increase the budget line for Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1379.431s">It</a> could be done very simply. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1380.872s">Right</a> now, councils make, on an average, $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1382.953s">The</a> large councils make $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1385.775s">The</a> ward councils make $15,000, $17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1389.997s">I'm</a> not advocating to give them additional money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1392.599s">I</a> just think it's a better form of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1394.38s">So</a> I don't want people to believe I want to increase their salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1398.062s">That's</a> not what I want.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1845.687s">Yeah,</a> I think it's great to propose new things in the community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1852.551s">I</a> think everyone would like a new high school, a new fire headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1858.415s">Even</a> our elementaries and middle schools now are 25 years old and they're getting up there to an age and doing a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1867.24s">I</a> think what you have to do is make a case for it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1870.862s">And</a> if we need a new high school, you have to say, what is enrollment like? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1875.565s">Do</a> we anticipate enrollment increasing? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1878.387s">That</a> high school was built for, I think, 3,500 or 4,000 students, or maybe even more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1883.771s">It's</a> at less than half capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1886.012s">right</a> now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1886.992s">We</a> just got a few years back school building assistance money, millions of dollars, like Councilor Penter said, to do science labs and so forth and rehab the high school pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1898.357s">And</a> I know they put a new roof on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1900.758s">And</a> we got 90% on the dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1904.199s">I</a> was on the school committee when we actually proposed going from neighborhood schools to centralized schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1911.062s">And</a> at the time, that was a huge issue because people liked having the neighborhood feel, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1916.346s">Your</a> kids walk to school, everything's within the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1920.049s">It</a> was a tough decision, but it was one that I think was warranted at the time because of the age and condition of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1927.374s">We</a> were able to give our kids state-of-the-art facilities in these schools now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1931.817s">So</a> I think, honestly, more due diligence needs to be had regarding the need for a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1938.622s">And</a> as Councilor Penta mentioned, there's a lot of needs out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1942.784s">And</a> I think looking at a new high school, you're talking anywhere from $200 million to maybe $300 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1949.867s">And</a> then displacing kids throughout the course of a whole school year and maybe even longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1957.53s">So</a> there's a lot to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1960.01s">It</a> sounds great, but I think, honestly, we need to see what type of reimbursement, if any. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1965.454s">You</a> know, if you work for the state, and Bedford just got $20 million from you, and then they're coming back saying, you know what, the $20 million you gave us, we're going to rip that down for the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1978.224s">to</a> build a brand new school and say, we just gave you 20 million 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1983.266s">Now</a> you want to rip it down? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1984.866s">So</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1986.207s">I</a> think there's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1987.767s">I'm</a> not opposed to a new school, but I really think that we haven't done our homework.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2257.637s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2257.918s">So</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2259.058s">Traffic</a> calming, when I was on the council, I'd probably say it was my number one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2265.822s">And</a> I fought hard to make sure our crosswalks were relined every year and so forth, to use thermoplastic rather than paint, because it lasts five years and paint fades away after a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2279.05s">So</a> you had a hard time on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2280.611s">Yeah,</a> there are a lot of issues, but one issue, John, that no one talks about, and it has to do with roads and sidewalks, is right now we have roughly 730-odd streets in the community, of which more than half are private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2297.672s">And</a> on a private way, the city will not typically get involved with the repair of a sidewalk, the cutting of a tree, the maintenance of a road, and you pay the same tax as everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2310.095s">So</a> if I happen to live on a private way, I don't get any of those services, but I pay the same tax as the next person. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2321.458s">And</a> to me, that has to be a number one priority that every street in this city is treated the same, whether you're private or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2331.242s">If</a> the city has to accept all the private ways as regular roads, they have to go through a process in order to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2340.006s">And</a> there's no reason when people would call me up and say, hey, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2343.328s">How</a> come they won't plow my street? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2345.188s">Or</a> how come they won't fix a pothole or cut this tree down? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2349.05s">And</a> I say, well, you live on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2352.011s">That's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2353.651s">It's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2356.191s">I</a> agree with Bob with the bump outs and everything else that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2359.592s">In</a> order to get federal and state money, Barbara will remember, when we did projects in the city and got federal and state money, which was good, it always came with string attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2371.214s">And</a> it was like on High Street, when we had to do away with all the parking, when we did all the different <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2378.675s">road</a> safety concerns, we went up to the Brooks School and they made us put a bike lane there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2384.257s">And</a> the bike lane led to nowhere, which was one of my big gripes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2388.618s">So</a> all of a sudden you have a bike lane and then it ends when you get to the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2394.92s">You're</a> on your bike and you're like, what do I do next? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2397.381s">Now</a> I'm mixed in with traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2399.782s">So</a> there's a lot of things that we don't put an emphasis, there's zero dollars in our budget <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2407.164s">to</a> repave streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2408.845s">Zero.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2410.226s">All</a> the money comes from whatever the state gives us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2415.268s">So</a> there is zero money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2416.989s">So</a> if we wanted to get serious, there should be a line item to pave a certain number of our 730 streets every year in order to, you know, make the changes that we want.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2494.977s">John,</a> the city implemented a pilot program probably 10 years ago for permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2502.44s">10</a> years ago, and we're still under the very same pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2507.302s">It's</a> the longest pilot program in the history of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2513.184s">It</a> shows you that we, not even a crawl, we're at a snail's pace in this city to get anything done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2520.227s">You</a> know, it's really sad.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2550.86s">Go</a> on, street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2553.021s">We</a> do street sweeping twice a year in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2556.423s">Surrounding</a> communities do it weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2558.845s">There's</a> no reason why we do our thoroughfares, but the neighborhoods, I live near Wellington, the debris that flows up from Dunkin' Donuts and all the stores down there, it's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2573.493s">There's</a> no reason why we can't have a street sweeping program, really.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2646.789s">Well,</a> when I was a member of the council, myself, Bob Penter and the rest of the councilors, we did a tour of all the fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2654.537s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2655.852s">I</a> would venture to say that there's not one council except for George Scarpelli that's been in all our fire stations now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2664.422s">And</a> really, many of them were in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2666.984s">They're</a> 90, 100 years old, some of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2671.213s">And,</a> you know, many of them lack just the basic amenities, like the showers and the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2676.977s">And</a> these are places where we're telling a brave man and woman that spent 24 hours a day, you know, back to back days. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2686.904s">you</a> know, when you go in the kitchen, you know, is very close to the apparatus, which, you know, leads to a lot of different concerns, health concerns, fire safety equipment that they use, their coats and so forth, need the proper cleaning after a fire for the soot and everything else because of the carcinogens and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2709.623s">So</a> there's a lot of issues that really need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2713.046s">And</a> when it comes time <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2716.148s">You</a> know, I've always supported our brave men and women in the fire and the police, and they're out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2722.172s">When</a> you need someone, they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2724.474s">When</a> you have a concern, the fire department's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2727.195s">When</a> you have a concern, the police department's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2729.697s">Our</a> DPW, I mean, you could go through the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2732.999s">You</a> know, our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2735.161s">We</a> have a lot of good municipal employees, but unfortunately, I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2741.785s">A</a> lot of their concerns are not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2745.49s">And</a> even when it comes to properly paying them, I think there's a lot that can be done to, sometimes you can't show it monetarily, but you show it in other ways that you're appreciative of what they do for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2761.627s">And</a> part of it is giving them a facility which they can be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2764.95s">Equipment,</a> cars, trucks, everything they can be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2769.974s">So</a> that's where I stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2772.036s">I've</a> always been a big advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2774.718s">Those</a> are difficult jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2776.419s">In</a> this day and age, they're even more difficult.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3091.658s">John,</a> can I add one thing, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3093.618s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3094.679s">Can</a> I add just one quick thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3096.64s">You</a> know, I think we have to remember, we elect Congress people to go up and work on national issues for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3102.982s">We</a> elect our U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3104.223s">senator</a> to go up and work on national issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3107.226s">We</a> represent our council to work on local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3112.151s">And</a> as far as I'm concerned right now, this present council is more concerned about working on national issues and has forgotten about local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3121.701s">So</a> in my opinion, on November 4th, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3124.243s">If</a> you're looking for a council that's going to reunite and take back and work on local issues and make that a number one priority, you have to look at Melanie Tringali, Nate Merritt, Nick Giurullo, George Scapelli, Rick Caraviello, Patrick Clerkin, Paul Donato Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3142.637s">Those</a> are the people that are going to protect our neighborhoods and put Method first and work on local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3149.302s">And</a> just my last point, John, I really want to thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3154.165s">and</a> your team for providing one of the only local access programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3160.009s">I</a> know you work with Bruce Patterson, who's been awesome to work with, Paul Garrity, yourself, Marco Cronali. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3169.535s">What</a> you guys are doing, really, I can't thank you enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3173.518s">We</a> don't have a local paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3175.319s">We</a> have no other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3176.64s">We</a> have a council that doesn't work for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3179.762s">Your</a> show is doing yeoman's work and just getting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3183.885s">Like</a> you said, this is a show for the city, for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3187.307s">There's</a> nothing more to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3189.388s">And</a> you welcome everyone on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3190.909s">If</a> they don't take advantage, that's their problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3193.891s">You</a> welcome everyone on your show. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3196.092s">And</a> I want to thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3317.405s">Go</a> on the Charter Review Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3321.043s">The</a> Charter Review Committee, comprised of residents of this community, spent two years of their life working to put together the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3329.729s">Whether</a> you like it or not, it's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3331.311s">Two</a> years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3332.171s">They</a> finally got all their recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3334.433s">They</a> went up to the council, and the president of the council told the two chairmen, when they were going to go up there and speak after countless meetings, two years worth of work, you have two minutes to sum up what you did in two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3348.583s">That's</a> a disgrace.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_E3nlU10YCrs/2024-11-19_E3nlU10YCrs.html">City Council 07-19-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7112.416s">I</a> would just ask if one of my colleagues would be kind enough to suspend the rules to allow residents that took time out of their busy schedule <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7122.786s">in</a> the middle of the summer, waiting for two hours, that we would allot them a little more than two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7129.039s">So</a> if we could suspend the rules.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7140.95s">Thank</a> you, and I appreciate that, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7144.691s">Michael</a> Marks for the record, 37 Wellington Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7149.453s">It's</a> been seven months since I've appeared before this body and in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7159.436s">And</a> the reason why I'm here tonight is because of the petition that is before us, which I believe strongly will hurt many, many people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7173.748s">And</a> that's the reason why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7178.311s">You</a> know, we've had discussions before this body for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7183.015s">And</a> some of the council has brought up tonight about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7187.368s">And</a> I can recall being part of subcommittees that have met 15 to 20 times to discuss snow shoveling ordinances or leaf blower ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7204.515s">And</a> here we have an issue of a prop two and a half override that's gonna cost the average taxpayer an additional 600 from the increase we just received in June on our taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7220.246s">And</a> have we had one subcommittee or committee of the whole to discuss this particular petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7230.494s">Have</a> we had one? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7233.324s">So</a> we haven't had one. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7235.57s">So</a> when it gets brought up about process, I would agree that there has been no process. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7242.295s">And</a> that is a major, major concern for me and many other people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7247.96s">I</a> appreciate the dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7249.441s">I</a> know there's people on both sides and I appreciate the dialogue and I can see both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7254.765s">But</a> I think many of the comments that have been made tonight, which I will reiterate some of them because my colleagues have already put out great comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7264.156s">is</a> the first is how much should a realistic budget be for the complete operations in the city of method? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7273.302s">Can</a> anyone behind this real that's in favor of this 12 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7278.378s">state</a> tonight, what is a realistic operational budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7282.699s">Because</a> if you're running a business, you know what your realistic operational budget is to run a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7289.521s">So</a> what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7291.022s">Can</a> anyone behind the reel tell me what the realistic operational budget for this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7299.001s">It's</a> a tough question, believe me, I know it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7301.803s">So</a> we haven't answered that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7304.485s">What</a> is a realistic budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7306.306s">Is</a> 12 million on top of this budget realistic? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7309.288s">Is</a> this gonna bring us to where we need to be, the promised land? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7316.372s">I</a> don't believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7318.834s">The</a> second point is, can anyone behind this reel <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7325.373s">refer</a> to any budgetary study that outlines the complete financial needs of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7333.5s">Can</a> anyone tell us <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7337.432s">of</a> a budgetary study I'd like, and I'm asking this as a question not, not to be facetious, I'm asking I'd like to know, because in my 20 years on the council, I can tell you firsthand, I was never part of any budgetary discussion regarding the operational needs of this community so I'd like to hear from the council because I think that's an important question.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7372.542s">Right,</a> and I think that's an important question that needs to be answered before we put the cot before the horse, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7381.309s">And</a> these are the things I think needed to be vetted out before we say, well, let's just let the voters decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7387.695s">I</a> think as the leaders in this community, we all look up to you as leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7392.659s">These</a> are the questions I think that need to be answered before we take the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7398.103s">When</a> is the last time a complete and independent audit has been done of all city functions? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7411.327s">The</a> reason why I ask is because when I was a member of the council, this council has always been on record asking for an independent audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7420.925s">And</a> we used to always state that an independent audit is not done by the same firm that's been hired by the administration for the past 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7430.451s">That</a> is not an independent audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7432.753s">And</a> I think members behind this reel could probably appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7437.676s">So</a> I think truly, if we're gonna move in a direction, and I'm not opposed to having these discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7442.739s">I</a> think this is healthy to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7445.141s">Put</a> it on the table, discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7447.373s">But</a> I think this information has to be on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7450.595s">Have</a> we had an independent audit? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7452.417s">The</a> answer is no. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7454.298s">The</a> answer is no. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7456.76s">So</a> when we look at, are there ways we can cut costs? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7459.782s">Are</a> there ways that we can work more efficiently? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7463.024s">There</a> absolutely is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7464.425s">Are</a> there things that we're doing that may be duplicate in nature? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7468.388s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7470.244s">And</a> council and I brought up one in particular about duplicate positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7474.505s">So</a> there's a lot of that that hasn't been looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7477.705s">You</a> know, when we say let's look at the charter, everyone's on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7481.726s">And</a> I was the first person to offer having the charter be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7485.807s">I</a> offered about seven or eight years ago before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7489.007s">And</a> it was sent to the state legislature and it died. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7491.648s">But</a> everyone wants to review the charter because it's the operational framework, how this city works. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7498.129s">And</a> it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7499.841s">You</a> wouldn't run a business and not change a business plan for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7503.965s">You'd</a> be out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7505.887s">This</a> city is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7507.749s">Now</a> we're running on a budget, like Councilor Knight said, that hasn't changed in 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7514.635s">Yes,</a> it increases every year, but the physical budget itself hasn't changed in 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7522.612s">and</a> throwing more money into the budget is not gonna solve any problems at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7528.798s">It's</a> not gonna solve anything at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7535.884s">The</a> following three questions need to be answered in order to support this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7543.378s">The</a> first one, and I think we've got somewhat of an answer is, what will the average increase be? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7549.241s">And</a> I think we heard tonight, we're looking at roughly 550,000 based on an assessed value of 650. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7556.964s">So</a> that could be seven or $800 depending on your assessed value. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7563.447s">Coupled</a> with the increase we just received <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7569.845s">when</a> the council and the mayor voted for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7574.008s">So</a> the 550 is one portion of an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7579.151s">The</a> other portion, you just approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7582.673s">So</a> when we look at the numbers, I think we have to put it in perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7586.255s">It's</a> not 550. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7586.776s">For</a> many of us, it's well over $1,000 that the increase may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7592.259s">Well</a> over $1,000.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7606.777s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7607.718s">I</a> think he said I was smart, so he can yell out any time he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7610.322s">I</a> think that's what he said.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7617.162s">No,</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7620.004s">But</a> this is a very important issue for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7623.126s">I'm</a> coming up here on behalf of the residents that reached out to me, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7628.009s">That's</a> why you haven't seen me in seven months. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7630.831s">This</a> is a huge, huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7633.293s">And</a> I would appreciate maybe if we could suspend the rules because <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7636.917s">I</a> don't feel like I've had five minutes and I feel rushed already.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7640.858s">I've</a> had seven minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7641.698s">I'm</a> already over. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7642.458s">Will</a> someone suspend the rules to allow residents to speak before the podium?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7648.44s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7648.68s">But,</a> but not fully, not fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7651.301s">I</a> think we were all, you know, listening to many speeches tonight and we'd like to be able to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7656.842s">It's</a> important. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7657.642s">There's</a> only, there's a dozen people. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7661.065s">There's</a> a dozen people in the audience.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7684.717s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7685.077s">Well,</a> I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7686.298s">I'd</a> like to finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7686.998s">I</a> only have a few more minutes left. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7688.499s">I</a> really appreciate finishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7691.02s">So</a> as we were mentioning, the 550 is not a realistic number for most residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7698.364s">So</a> that's question number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7699.805s">What</a> actually will this cost the residents of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7706.508s">There</a> was a comment made tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7708.929s">Each</a> year, we're doing more with less. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7713.412s">That</a> comment can't be furthest from the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7717.183s">as</a> a taxpayer for 30 years in this community, 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7721.204s">This</a> is my 30th year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7722.885s">Taxes</a> have gone up each and every year for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7726.446s">So</a> I don't know how we're doing more with less. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7729.968s">The</a> city is getting more money each and every year from the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7735.129s">It</a> may be not spent wisely, but they're getting more money each and every year from the taxpayers of this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7765.662s">Well,</a> as Councilor Wright said, I think it's a spending issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7768.803s">So</a> I think that's what I'm trying to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7773.244s">The</a> other question is, what impact will this have, this tax increase on our most vulnerable residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7780.006s">And</a> I think that's the key and that's actually why I'm up here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7783.347s">So</a> when we talk about seniors on fixed incomes, which my colleagues mentioned, we don't wanna address that, but truly people are making decisions whether they eat, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7795.31s">or</a> take medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7797.173s">And</a> maybe members behind this reel don't see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7800.698s">You</a> don't experience it, but it's happening in our community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7804.984s">I'll</a> tell you firsthand, it's happening in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7807.948s">And</a> we're asking residents to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7811.809s">So</a> I just want people to be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7815.092s">What</a> about the young families that paid top dollar for their home and brought in this community recently and have to decide whether their child will play sports, whether they'll go on vacation, whether they'll save for their college tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7830.805s">These</a> are the decisions that have to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7834.488s">So</a> it's easy to say, hey, look what 12 million will do for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7839.703s">But</a> what's the collateral damage to that 12 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7843.888s">It's</a> the seniors on fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7846.01s">It's</a> the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7847.391s">It's</a> the renters that Councilor Caraviello has mentioned in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7852.136s">Many</a> people, many landlords are going to pass this on to the renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7856.501s">And</a> that's what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7858.512s">And</a> as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, what about the seniors in this community that brought their home 25, 30, 40 years ago in a property rich, like Councilor Caraviello says, and income poor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7872.278s">$500,</a> I would submit to you, is a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7877.981s">It's</a> a lot of money for people on fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7883.396s">So</a> I think, you know, when you talk about a cavalier, cavalier saying that, well, it's only 500, it's only 550. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7891.121s">And,</a> you know, I think you gotta be mindful of who is living in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7896.465s">And</a> my last point, and I appreciate the time, believe me, and I don't wanna take up any more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7901.729s">We're</a> in a time of uncertainty. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7903.79s">We're</a> talking about inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7905.431s">We're</a> talking about recession. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7907.813s">And</a> here we want to raise additional taxes on top of taxes we just raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7914.7s">How</a> blindsided is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7916.882s">We</a> have to be living under a rock to say now is a good time to increase taxes again a second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7927.437s">So</a> I think this is what you're hearing from the community, at least what I'm hearing from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7931.898s">Maybe</a> the council's tone deaf, certain members of the council, but this is what I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7937.2s">Yeah,</a> we all have a wishlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7938.721s">Streets</a> should be done and so forth and more teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7941.982s">We</a> all have a wishlist, but we have to work within the confines of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7947.924s">And</a> when we start pricing people out of this community, it's not a community I want to be part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7956.227s">I</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7958.72s">For</a> your time, I thank you for your consideration, and I would only ask when you make your vote, make sure that those three subjects regarding the impact of people, regarding the cost, regarding how it's gonna affect each and every resident becomes part of your consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7977.029s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE/2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE.html">City Council 12-21-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=528.114s">It</a> was an honor and a privilege to serve with Paulette Vander Kloof for the six years I was on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=536.995s">Paulette,</a> don't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=539.516s">During</a> that period of time, Mr. President, the school committee ushered in what we refer to still after 20 something years, the brand new schools in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=550.342s">And</a> that was a very trying time as a member of Vanderkloot remembers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=555.706s">It</a> was a lot of time and effort put into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=558.668s">And</a> the one thing, Mr. President, I do remember is Paulette Vanderkloot gave birth to her daughter on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=569.817s">Is</a> that not correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=572.479s">And,</a> you know, being a politician, I wanted to try to outdo Paulette. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=579.148s">And</a> I missed it by about six hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=582.31s">My</a> wife gave birth to our twins the night before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=587.112s">And</a> I still resent that, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=588.413s">I</a> don't know how you held off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=590.374s">I</a> don't know what food you were eating, but you did a great job holding off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=594.576s">And</a> the other point I have to mention, Mr. President, that I still resent to this day, is that Paulette Van der Kloot stole <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=603.501s">George</a> Scarpelli's slogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=606.463s">Give</a> a hoot vote, Scarpelli was the original slogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=612.026s">And</a> that was stolen by Paulette. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=613.807s">And</a> I hope someday she recognizes that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=617.169s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1011.907s">And</a> if you can give a brief synopsis, I believe we have someone from the mayor's office on.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1291.97s">Chair</a> awaits the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1292.931s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1293.971s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1295.533s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1308.704s">Right,</a> but we had a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1310.265s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1310.906s">Which</a> questions were asked of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1314.591s">And</a> I think we should at least get those questions answered before we go through the whole process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1321.056s">But</a> I had one question regarding frontline workers and first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1326.039s">And</a> we were told by the city administration that there may be a salary limitation for those workers to receive APA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1339.289s">And</a> I was wondering if that question has been answered, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1416.423s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1416.963s">So</a> from what I'm hearing tonight, that would not be a reason that frontline workers and first responders would not be able to attain some upper money <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1426.214s">for</a> being on the front lines during the past 22 months of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1431.716s">So</a> that's encouraging to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1433.596s">I</a> just hope the administration falls through, Mr. President, taking care of those workers, as I mentioned during the Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1441.099s">We're</a> talking about workers that work at a convenience store. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1445.66s">that</a> were in the front line, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1447.401s">We're</a> talking about workers at stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1449.721s">We're</a> talking about workers that worked in a doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1453.362s">We're</a> talking about postal workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1455.763s">We're</a> talking about police, fire, EMTs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1459.784s">So</a> I just hope, Mr. President, with this $49 million the city's receiving from the federal government, that we put our money where our mouth is and take care of those workers, Mr. President, that put their life on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1475.182s">and</a> put their family's life on the line to make sure we could function as a community and as a society. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1481.824s">So</a> I would hope the administration steps forward on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1486.146s">Amendment</a> O, as I mentioned, Mr. President, it says that this is a CAF 12, which is the federal funds manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1494.648s">I</a> don't believe that it's a CAF 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1500.75s">I</a> would say that's more of a CAF <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1503.687s">15,</a> Mr. President, based on that salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1506.948s">And</a> I don't know if that's an error that was made by the administration, but if they can also talk to that, Mr. President, I'd be curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1514.889s">Nina,</a> can you answer that question?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1549.919s">So</a> that is an error that we're being asked to vote on, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1554.861s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1555.421s">And</a> that's an important change, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1558.447s">And</a> the last point, Mr. President, I would like to bring up, and I brought this up during the Committee of the Whole meeting, so I've been very consistent on bringing up this issue, is the fact that we still have department heads in this community, non-union department heads, who for the past 22 months have not received a step raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1581.829s">And</a> I think the question was offered by Vice President Knight about whether that's contractual or not and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1589.015s">But</a> here we have a number of upper positions, Mr. President, at salaries that far exceed some of our department heads, existing department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1602.977s">So</a> it's a tough pill to swallow when we're asking to bring in new positions, Mr. President, at a higher salary range while existing employees, existing department heads did not get their step raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1621.202s">And</a> we heard money was tight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1624.503s">And</a> now we have $49 million of federal funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1630.392s">and</a> we have commitments out there to every non-union department head that they should receive their step raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1639.595s">So</a> I have a real tough time, Mr. President, voting for new positions for ARPA at a higher salary range without taking care of existing employees in this building that have been in here every day fighting through the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1659.383s">And</a> that's an important distinction, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1662.064s">We</a> should take care of the workers we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1664.526s">And</a> as I stated at the community hall meeting, if we don't address frontline workers, first responders, as part of this ARPA funding, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1678.115s">And</a> if we don't take care of city employees, current city employees, I will not support this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1684.537s">I</a> don't care how critical the administration says it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1687.358s">They've</a> been sitting on this paper for the past four months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1691.18s">We</a> don't even have a federal funds manager, someone to oversee all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1696.021s">They</a> could have put a federal funds manager, the first position on several months back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1702.806s">And</a> now we're being told this is critical.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2357.074s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2357.975s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2358.995s">Any</a> further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2361.035s">Mr.</a> President, just a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2363.116s">The</a> fire department has been without a contract, I believe, for close to two years now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2598.152s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2598.932s">Before</a> you call the roll, I'd like to go on record, Mr. President, stating that I will not be supporting this position until we find out about other city employees that have not received their step raises, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2609.415s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2610.275s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2738.895s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2739.796s">I</a> will not be voting on this position as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2743.338s">I</a> just find it ironic, Mr. President, that when these positions were put forth for spending of ARPA money to assist in COVID needs in the community, that the administration was at the table, the Office of Community Development was at the table, and the Board of Health was at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2764.26s">who</a> was not at the table, Mr. President, that would equally have needs for COVID spending, the Council on Aging was not at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2773.908s">Police</a> and fire, first responders in this community were not at the table to seek what their needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2781.094s">The</a> building department, DPW, the Office of Diversity, Mr. President, was not at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2790.119s">So</a> in a sense of fairness, Mr. President, when we talk about not having a plan, as Councilor Falco mentions, he's absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2800.844s">Again,</a> here we are going forward without a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2805.627s">I'm</a> having deja vu. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2807.628s">Two</a> weeks ago, they asked us to vote to extend contracts so the city administration could take parking enforcement in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2817.119s">And</a> this council said, what's the plan that you have to take over this program January 5th of next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2824.245s">And</a> the administration says, we don't have a plan.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2841.398s">I</a> understand there's a need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2844.734s">but</a> there's also a need to follow a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2847.795s">There's</a> also a need to include all stakeholders, Mr. President, and that's currently not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2855.737s">When</a> you have three department heads sitting around a table and omitting the other 10 department heads that have similar needs, I have a concern with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2864.499s">When</a> you're bringing in people off the street at a higher salary, Mr. President, then counting workers, I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2872.787s">When</a> people aren't getting step raises and this council votes to bring people off the street at a higher salary, I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2882.51s">And</a> we can always put things off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2884.571s">You</a> know, I hear people fighting for people and people fight for this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2888.793s">When</a> push comes to shove, they bury their head in the sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2895.258s">And</a> this is the exact issue right now when we talk about first responders and we talk about frontline workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2901.16s">Again,</a> we allow the administration to go off without a plan, and we refuse, Mr. President, to address the current needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2912.124s">It's</a> a sad state of affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2914.245s">Let</a> me tell you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2915.805s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3293.528s">You</a> should stay home then.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3296.31s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3298.091s">We'll</a> be soon enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3298.932s">All</a> right.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3904.486s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, as I stated from the outset, this is the truly the only one position Mr. President, the federal funds manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3913.431s">that</a> should have been put on first. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3915.332s">This</a> is how you get the ball rolling to then have your public meetings and input from stakeholders to then establish what you wanna do in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3925.879s">So</a> we're kind of putting the horse before the cart by doing this after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3930.362s">So</a> I support this one position, Mr. President, getting the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3936.425s">I</a> still find it troubling that tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3940.704s">We</a> have the Board of Health Director, who's the highest health official in the city, saying, I need a laundry list of positions because we're concerned about the increase in COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3953.593s">And</a> we have members of this council tonight picking and choosing from the Board of Health Director saying, I need these positions, they're vital, choosing only to put on positions that currently have someone in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3970.188s">If</a> there's no one in the position, Mr. President, members of this council are saying, we're tabling it for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3977.814s">And</a> then the health director saying, no, I need this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3982.132s">So</a> it makes no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3984.314s">And</a> that's what happens when you do piecemeal, like Councilor Scarpelli said, when you don't have a plan, you make decisions, Mr. President, not based on anything other than knee-jerk reactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3995.985s">And</a> that's what this council's doing now, knee-jerk reactions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4001.19s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4001.63s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4424.848s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4426.769s">And</a> this has been a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4430.11s">The</a> connectivity, I think, is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4433.411s">It</a> adds a safety element for pedestrians, cyclists, that I think will serve a purpose that has been needed in this community for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4445.676s">It'll</a> connect the east side of Medford into Medford Square and far beyond, Mr. President, in a safe fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4453.552s">The</a> one concern in the neighborhood meetings that I attended back some time ago, probably close to two years ago, maybe even longer than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4461.595s">time</a> flies, is that we're now introducing a bike path slash pedestrian path within feet from the rear doors of many residents on Clippership Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4477.965s">And</a> that was a major concern at the time of many property owners in that area that, you know, that support the project, but we're also concerned that now we're introducing <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4490.981s">people,</a> bikes, foot walkers that have never been in that area before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4497.403s">And</a> they were concerned about safety, public safety and rightfully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4502.144s">So</a> I was wondering, I noticed in the correspondence we received, it said the purpose of the easement is to install, construct, operate, maintain, repair the recreational non-motorized bicycle pedestrian trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4517.369s">but</a> it doesn't talk about who is actually going to provide the public safety and patrol that particular area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4526.651s">Now</a> that we're introducing people along the river back there, that was never a path. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4534.633s">So</a> I didn't know if the woman from DCI can answer that question or someone from the city administration, but I have a concern about the patrolling and the safety <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4546.877s">of</a> that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4549.038s">And</a> will it be lit, Mr. President, at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4552.94s">We</a> all took, at least I know I did, a tour of the whole area along the water back there, and it's a dark, isolated area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4561.685s">And</a> I wanna make sure when we do this, I support this 1,000%, but I wanna make sure we're not introducing a public safety concern as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4571.19s">So</a> I would ask the representative from DCR or someone from the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4576.473s">to</a> talk about safety and security of people using the path, as well as the direct above us.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4659.235s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4660.276s">So</a> Mr. President, just so I understand, so there is a commitment that public safety will be provided either by the city of Medford or by state police when this is finally built out and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4674.586s">So</a> there is a commitment in that part of safety will be enforced, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4680.31s">If</a> I understood that right, I think that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4682.051s">Am</a> I correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6410.442s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6413.244s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6416.087s">I</a> truly believe we shouldn't recognize anyone if they're not here for over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6430.472s">that</a> you can get in a disagreement and an argument with that was so nice that you didn't realize you were arguing with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6438.595s">Really,</a> John was nice about everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6441.417s">I</a> don't ever remember a bad word said about John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6445.958s">And</a> John, I refer to as someone that walks soft but carried a big stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6453.522s">And</a> this council, over the six years John served, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6457.734s">made</a> some major changes to things that people in the public may not know or didn't receive press, but it was John Falco that revamped our whole budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6469.993s">It</a> was John Falco's expertise in budgeting and finance that led to major changes on how we review the budget and how we as a council request the administration to present the budget to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6484.121s">And</a> that was thanks to John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6486.342s">And</a> that wasn't press, that was anything other than John wanting to do the right thing and making the process transparent, which leads to my other point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6496.608s">It</a> was John Falco <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6498.65s">during</a> this COVID period for the last 22 months that stood up and said, we need to still operate government. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6505.391s">We</a> still need to have transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6507.412s">We</a> still need to include the community, even though we may not have open forums or forums people can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6514.953s">And</a> it was John that led the charge to make sure in our Committee of the Whole meetings and subcommittee meetings that may not be on the floor were taped and televised live. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6526.339s">That</a> was john Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6527.62s">Now</a> that didn't get a ton of fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6529.821s">But</a> when you talk about transparency, john just didn't talk the talk he walked the walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6535.243s">And</a> that was a major change of this council, and it led to boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6540.611s">and</a> other entities in the community fall in suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6543.633s">So</a> for those two reasons, Mr. President, I wanna thank John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6547.415s">I</a> know this is not the last we're gonna see of John in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6550.977s">And</a> he's a great family man, as we can see from his family and three sons and his wife in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6557.481s">And</a> John, it was a pleasure serving with you for the past six years.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8495.618s">Beautiful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8496.299s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8496.979s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8497.778s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8498.678s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8499.678s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8529.056s">This</a> is bittersweet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8531.958s">It's</a> been a long run and I've enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8535.7s">You</a> know, tonight's go around with all the Councilors, I would recommend for the next council, try doing that once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8548.808s">Try</a> turning to your colleague and saying, thank you for doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8552.39s">Thank</a> you for doing that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8587.745s">talk</a> issues out has changed over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8591.387s">My</a> temperament has changed, believe it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8596.17s">But</a> one thing that hasn't changed is my love for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8603.735s">And</a> I will forever be grateful for the honor and privilege to serve the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8614.55s">for</a> the past three decades, 26 years altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8620.374s">You</a> know, when people put their trust and confidence in you, it's probably the highest form of respect someone can show, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8629.541s">Someone</a> that takes the time to go to the poll and say, I'm with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8633.584s">Someone</a> to put up a launch sign, someone to donate money in tough times. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8638.608s">And</a> that always meant so much to me that <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8643.199s">Why</a> would all these people put their trust and confidence in me? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8646.601s">I</a> never realized it until it dawned on me that we're all in this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8656.388s">We</a> have a great community here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8659.771s">And</a> what makes the community is its residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8663.133s">It's</a> not the city of Medford, it's its residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8666.295s">It's</a> the people that live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8667.715s">It's</a> the people that care. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8670.116s">And,</a> you know, I truly believe that what makes us a great community is a community that's united. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8680.559s">And</a> there are going to be many issues that may separate us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8682.999s">There</a> are going to be many issues that we may have differences of agreement on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8686.78s">But</a> I think the one thing we can agree upon is that we want to move this city forward and we love this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8693.873s">And</a> I think we're at that point now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8698.117s">I</a> wanna thank my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8701.18s">I</a> have my three children here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8702.981s">I</a> didn't have kids when I first ran for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8707.426s">And</a> it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8709.067s">I</a> have three children here tonight, my son, Evan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8718.061s">who's</a> finishing up his studies at UMass Amherst. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8722.643s">My</a> daughter Olivia, who just took her test and is now a registered dietician. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8733.426s">And</a> my oldest, my daughter Gianna, who is a first grade teacher.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8750.679s">And</a> I just wanna thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8752.42s">I</a> wanna thank for being there for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8755.982s">I</a> wanna thank for allowing me to participate at the fullest. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8761.224s">I</a> gave this job my everything for almost three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8765.546s">And</a> no matter what people say, and I don't have to tell my colleagues, it takes from your family life. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8771.376s">But</a> I signed up for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8772.476s">I'm</a> not, I wouldn't change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8774.497s">I</a> signed up for it, but my family was there every inch of the way through good times and bad times. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8781.4s">And</a> I want to thank my three kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8783.78s">My</a> biggest supporter, my rock, my wife Lisa is at home tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8788.942s">Anyone</a> that knows my wife Lisa knows that she's not one for the limelight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8793.884s">She</a> never has, never will. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8795.944s">She's</a> always been consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8798.035s">And</a> the one reason why I was able to do what I did for so many years and do the research and study and do the things that I needed to do and be at events and everything a politician does is because I had that rock at my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8814.166s">I</a> had the foundation, the beacon that my wife served as raising the children and being the supportive wife and mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8824.594s">And</a> without that, I wouldn't be anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8828.7s">So</a> I'd like to thank my wife, Lisa.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8835.926s">My</a> mother started me off with family values back 55 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8842.871s">And</a> it was her guidance over the years that shaped how I voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8851.778s">And</a> I never realized that until I took a step back and said, this was my mother that <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8857.924s">gave</a> me these particular values. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8859.465s">This</a> was my mother that raised four children as a single parent and did her best to give us a roof over our head and provide the opportunities that she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8871.775s">And</a> I will forever be grateful for my mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8878.478s">and</a> her support over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8880.099s">I</a> wanna thank my in-laws, Linda and Vincenzo Federico. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8883.462s">If</a> you ever came to one of my fundraisers, they used to make the best thick pizzellis, not the thin ones, the best thick pizzellis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8891.649s">And</a> when you came in the door, I'd go to shake a hand and they would go right over to my in-laws and get their pizzellis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8898.888s">And</a> I think most people were there to get the pizzellis, which was fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8902.929s">It</a> was fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8904.309s">And</a> I just want to thank my in-laws, Linda, Machenzo, Federico, for the many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8909.951s">I</a> want to thank all the volunteers in the community that served on boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8915.192s">Talk</a> about being behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8917.092s">Talk</a> about volunteering, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8920.688s">This</a> is the very heartbeat of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8923.129s">It's</a> the volunteers that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8925.129s">It's</a> the people that are doing this, not for any praise, but because they love the community because they want to do better in the community, and they want to see our city progress forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8935.612s">So</a> I'd like to thank all the countless volunteers that I've been involved with over the past 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8941.633s">I</a> want to thank the countless community groups, civic organizations that we all come in contact with on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8951.661s">And</a> as Councilor Falco alluded to, this was never about me, honestly, and I still feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8960.968s">Someone</a> just looked up at the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8963.694s">I</a> got a lot of pages ahead of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8966.115s">I</a> got a lot of, I got a page for each year, so just bear with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8973.858s">But</a> I want to recognize at this point, I've never done this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8977.619s">I</a> want to recognize the city workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8979.86s">The</a> city workers are the heartbeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8982.201s">They're</a> the lifeline of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8984.462s">And</a> they get very little recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8986.943s">And</a> they do tremendous work on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8990.724s">This</a> city doesn't operate by chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8993.457s">It's</a> because of the hundreds and not thousands of city employees that make this city function. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8999.721s">And</a> I'd like to take the time to recognize an office we deal with on a consistent basis, the city clerk in the registrar voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9009.268s">I'd</a> like to recognize Clerk Herbise, who has been the city clerk for the last several years, and probably one of

href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9050.357s">People</a> would ask me, what is that guy doing in the corner? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9054.079s">So</a> he's the city messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9055.379s">He's</a> a very important job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9057.86s">And</a> Larry, I consider you a friend. <a

href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9070.583s">Commissioner</a> Paul Moki, a gentleman that's been in this community a number of years and handles the day-to-day operations of every building function, every permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9081.085s">It's</a> a giant job, and Paul Moki has done a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9084.485s">I'd</a> like to thank Amy Tanaglia, Dennis McDonald, Jeff Fago, Kenny Lanzilli, Mike Malabar, and Paul Smith in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9097.288s">I'd</a> like to thank Director

href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9120.842s">I've</a> probably bothered Steve Tenaglia over my 26-year career than anyone else in the community. <a

working on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9137.43s">And</a> no matter how big the crack was in the sidewalk or the hole in the street, you were out there when we called. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9143.953s">You</a> made things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9145.413s">And</a> Steve, I will always be grateful for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9149.811s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9151.332s">I</a> want to thank Mike Nestor, the park foreman that keeps our

href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9189.636s">The</a> first responders, as I spoke about tonight, Chief Jack Buckley, Patrol Union Representative Hal McGilvery, and all the brave men and women of the police department, our first responders that have done a tremendous job protecting the life and property of residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9208.828s">It's</a> a thankless job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9210.665s">but</a> it's a very important job in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9213.326s">The</a> fire department, I'd like to thank incoming chief John Friedman. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9218.228s">And</a> I'd like to thank union president Eddie Buckley on his many years of support and camaraderie. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9226.51s">I</a> have to say, and I don't like to show favoritism, but the fire department, I consider them all brothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9234.393s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9235.373s">I</a> never met a bunch of gentlemen that, and women, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9240.215s">that</a> really cared for this community, that stepped up when needed, and I will ever be grateful for the fire department in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9254.024s">My</a> one regret <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9255.725s">Um,</a> and I have several is that we never acted upon a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9262.55s">And</a> I would ask my colleagues, uh, as they move forward that we keep the commitment we gave to the fire department like we did with the police department to create a brand new state of the art fire headquarters and training facility <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9277.3s">that</a> they all so well deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9280.441s">Um,</a> so I hope that commitment is kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9282.581s">I</a> want to thank the health department director, Marianne O'Connor, uh, over the last 22 months, who has done yeoman's work with providing, um, health service in this community during covid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9294.864s">I</a> want to thank veteran service director, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9297.305s">Michael</a> Durham, who in my opinion, over the last few years, has done so much work to put veterans on the radar in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9307.434s">Give</a> veterans a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9309.196s">Make</a> sure that you're out there looking for the services that veterans may not be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9314.221s">Mike</a> would be the first to step forward and have the ability and knowledge to get things done and accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9321.407s">And</a> I want to thank Mike Durham for his years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9326.25s">Farmer</a> City employees that I had the privilege to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9330.752s">If</a> I miss some, I apologize, but the ones that come to mind, Farmer City Clerk Ed Finn, Farmer Mayor Michael McGlynn, Farmer City Solicitor Mark Rumley, who I consider a dear friend and advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9345.718s">former</a> DPW Commissioner Paul Gere, former Budget Director Richard Lee, former Fire Chief Larry Sands, former Fire Chief Frank Gilberti, former Police Chief Leo Sacco, former Board of Health Director Karen Rose, former Treasure Collector Fred Pompeo Jr., <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9363.725s">former</a> superintendent of schools that I served with, Roy Belson, and former superintendent of schools, Phil DeVoe that I served with as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9371.112s">I'd</a> like to thank my fellow colleagues on the school committee that I served with for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9379.439s">We,</a> as I mentioned tonight, I was part of building the new schools and talk about going from a process where we had neighborhood schools to centralized schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9390.978s">It</a> was probably one of the biggest contentious issues in this city's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9395.4s">But</a> as a school committee, we rolled up our sleeves, we had our public meetings, and we were able to build centralized schools, state-of-the-art schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9405.365s">And</a> that I am very proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9406.986s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues that I serve with, Lena DiGentimasso, who talk about a fighter, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9413.753s">There's</a> someone that served three decades, never ran for any other office, but always cared about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9421.258s">And</a> I'll never forget when we were building the new schools, we had to go look at the old schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9426.662s">And</a> I was behind every ladder to the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9429.715s">following</a> Linda Gigentomaso with her high heels, climbing the ladder to get to the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9436.439s">This</a> is the dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9438.4s">Jack</a> Buckley. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9439.66s">Jack</a> Buckley, when I served with him, Jack was a very intelligent man. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9444.323s">And</a> I was very young of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9447.664s">And</a> he used to always say during the meetings, the TQM approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9452.067s">And</a> I'd be like, wow, TQM, this is something big. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9455.168s">And</a> he'd say it all the time, total quality management. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9459.159s">And</a> 25 years later, I have still not forgotten what TQM stands for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9465.422s">And</a> that was the type of Jack Buckley was in charge of the building of the schools project. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9469.783s">That</a> was the type of dedication Jack had and his business acumen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9473.972s">that</a> that's where he came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9476.233s">And</a> it's funny how the little things stick with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9479.193s">And</a> that was one thing that stuck with me with Jack Buckley, Paul Van der Kloot, who we recognize tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9484.655s">I</a> served with Paulette for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9487.235s">Bob</a> Skerry, Bob Emmett Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9489.616s">I</a> served with Beth Fuller, who was the best knitter in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9493.898s">would</a> be at committee meetings and she'd knit a blanket while we were sitting there actually just listening, she would knit a blanket. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9502.072s">I</a> always felt that I wasn't doing enough with my time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9505.478s">She</a> made me feel guilty. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9507.822s">Ed</a> Nolan, who's a great firefighter, and I happen to have the opportunity to serve with Ed Nolan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9514.624s">And</a> last but not least, Bill Brady, who was a great school committee member and a tenacious advocate for the children of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9525.066s">Former</a> colleagues on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9527.547s">My</a> colleague here, Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9528.987s">You</a> know, when I first got on the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9533.02s">I'll</a> be honest with you, I was intimidated by him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9536.482s">He</a> was rough and gruff, but as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I come to know a gentleman that only cared and loved about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9547.768s">His</a> delivery may be a little questionable once in a while, but he cared about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9554.732s">Bob</a> always told me, stand up for your beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9557.633s">You</a> can never go wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9559.4s">And</a> I would advise anyone coming into public office, that's the number one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9564.722s">Stand</a> up for what you believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9565.902s">You</a> can never ever go wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9568.803s">Never.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9569.923s">Robert</a> Mayorko, no disregard to you, Mr. President, but the best president I ever served with on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9579.046s">He</a> coined the phrase, at least he takes credit for it, that this city council is the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9585.949s">And</a> that always stuck with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9587.889s">because</a> if you had an issue, there's nowhere else to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9593.053s">And</a> this has to be the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9595.955s">I</a> would ask my colleagues to always keep that microphone open for whoever wants to come up on the public participation, whoever wants to speak on no matter what the issue may be, this has to maintain itself as the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9610.285s">Otherwise</a> we will lose confidence in government and that's the last thing we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9616.349s">Paul</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9618.899s">You</a> know, when Paul got on the council, it dawned on me immediately when we were debating whether or not to allow Wendy's on Middlesex Ave, which was my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9632.489s">And</a> we were debating it back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9634.37s">And</a> I'll never forget, Paul Camuso said to the representatives from Wendy's, all the higher ups were here, all the bigwigs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9641.235s">And</a> he said, we have to have more fine dining like Wendy's in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9648.757s">And</a> I said we're going to be for a long ride with this guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9654.361s">Stephanie</a> machini Burke, I mean, Stephanie's had a long run in this community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9659.945s">I</a> had the opportunity to serve a number of years, became mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9666.493s">was</a> responsible for the police station and a brand new library and has done yeoman's work pushing this community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9674.117s">Brianna</a> Lungo-Curran was the current mayor and I served with for 18 years and I wish her well in the future years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9682.622s">Fred</a> Dello Russo, the last person to ever let you down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9690.246s">That's</a> a little joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9691.927s">That's</a> a little joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9695.737s">Fred</a> Dello Russo gave a perspective of business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9699.34s">Every</a> Councilor has their own perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9701.301s">And</a> that's why you have to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9702.502s">And</a> you may get in arguments, but everyone has their own ideas and their own perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9706.705s">And</a> Fred came from a chamber of commerce and a business perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9710.468s">And</a> that was always helpful for me because he was a business minded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9716.132s">Bill</a> Carr Sr. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9717.513s">I</a> remember his slogan, nothing changes if nothing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9724.182s">But</a> when I looked at the slogan, I said, well, how basic, but when you think about it, nothing changes if nothing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9730.343s">And</a> he was absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9732.124s">And</a> I'll never forget that slogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9734.344s">And</a> I consider Bill Carr a good friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9737.745s">Jim</a> DiGiacomo, I had the opportunity to serve one term with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9741.226s">And</a> Jim was an excellent city councilor and a real people person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9746.807s">Macarena.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9747.928s">I</a> served just a short period of time when one council stepped down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9752.41s">Macarena</a> took over for about 10 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9755.071s">And</a> he was a man of commitment and dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9760.253s">And</a> I wish Mac well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9766.075s">State</a> Rep Paul Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9769.717s">Paul</a> got off the council to run for state rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9772.798s">That's</a> when I got on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9776.234s">No</a> one has done more to bring in local aid than Paul Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9781.136s">Paul</a> Donato's name is synonymous with local aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9785.858s">I</a> mean, I don't wanna go through the laundry list, but just take a walk into Chevalier Auditorium and look at the brand new seats and look at the air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9794.621s">And</a> that wasn't done for any other reason than we have an advocate in the state house, Paul Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9801.464s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9804.175s">A</a> little known fact about Paul Donato, and I hope you don't mind me sharing this, because I know you're not a vain person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9813.643s">Paul</a> Donato was one of the original signees on methods incorporation papers in 1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9822.03s">1892,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9830.185s">And</a> I want to thank you for your many, many years of service, Representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9836.047s">And</a> I consider you a friend as well, Representative Donato, and always will be supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9842.369s">My</a> present colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9844.609s">And</a> we have the two newest colleagues, Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9850.871s">With</a> COVID, we didn't have a real opportunity to get to know each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9858.607s">or</a> know where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9861.549s">And</a> I think that may have been some of maybe, I don't wanna say tension, but maybe some of the misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9869.113s">And</a> I know you both have great intentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9873.275s">I</a> know both of you will move this city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9878.258s">I</a> would ask that you just take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9880.979s">And</a> as I tell everyone, God gave us two ears, do twice as much listening than speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9888.063s">And</a> I take that to myself, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9890.285s">That's</a> no reflection on anyone, but listen, because you learn so much when you listen and hear what people have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9897.112s">And</a> I want to thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9898.594s">Anyone</a> that throws their hat in the ring to run for public office, I think is an admirable cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9906.882s">And</a> anyone willing to do that, especially at a young age. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9910.77s">I've</a> always preached in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9912.991s">I've</a> supported wide representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9914.953s">I've</a> supported initiatives to get people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9918.595s">Even</a> though I ran for office, I want to see more people get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9922.097s">So</a> I'm glad that we have young people in this community as my neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9927.802s">Justin,</a> while a lot of people don't know, he's my neighbor right across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9932.488s">He</a> called me up several months back and said, Mike, I'm running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9937.234s">And</a> I said, oh, you moved out of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9939.377s">And</a> he said, no, I'm running for Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9942.714s">And</a> a funny fact is that when I moved to Wellington Road some 30 years ago, I got a phone call from Angelo Morata. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9951.656s">And</a> that may not sound familiar from a lot of people, but he said, I just want you to know, and I didn't know him from a hole in the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9958.778s">So</a> I just want you to know that I was the original resident on Wellington Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9965.521s">and</a> I am therefore the original councilor on Wellington Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9969.506s">So</a> Justin, just so you know, I am the original city councilor on Wellington Road and don't ever forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9977.356s">And</a> don't ever forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9980.79s">I'd</a> like to thank my colleagues, Council beers Council morale for their dedicated service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9987.456s">I'd</a> like to thank Councilor Falco, who I stated earlier, made meetings, more transparent in this community, made the budget process, a far better process in this community, and just <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10003.769s">lent</a> a sense of calmness to this council that I am appreciative for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10008.552s">And</a> I wanna thank you for all your years of service and years of commitment to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10017.258s">Adam</a> Knight, I mean, who's done more for working families? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10020.861s">I</a> didn't know half about what he was talking about unions and about living wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10025.484s">But</a> it was Adam Knight that brought the issues up and Adam Knight that fought for the unions in this community and fought for working families. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10034.607s">It</a> made sure that they were at the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10036.848s">And</a> there were many issues that I learned about listening to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10042.09s">And</a> I have to say, I will forever be thankful for opening my eyes up to those issues in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10050.893s">Talk</a> about a parliamentarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10053.332s">I</a> mean, when he first got on the council, I said, oh, this kid's in for trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10056.554s">Oh,</a> I'm gonna get him until he start calling rule seven, section 1630. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10059.996s">So</a> what's this guy doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10063.057s">But</a> when did he learn this stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10064.678s">And</a> sure enough, he was the parliamentarian and I have to give him credit that he picked up on that second nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10071.002s">Maybe</a> it's his legislative experience and his commitment to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10076.084s">But</a> I wanna thank you for your friendship and years of service as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10081.707s">George</a> Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10084.332s">I</a> mean, I refer to him as Coach Scarpelli because George has done more for youth sports in this community than anyone in the history of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10095.074s">And</a> I'm not just saying that because he's sitting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10097.535s">You</a> know, George to me, George was working with underprivileged students before there were people working with underprivileged students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10109.197s">George</a> was the one that reached across the aisle. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10111.778s">George</a> was the one <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10114.453s">that</a> lent himself to getting out there and looking for those in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10120.135s">So</a> I refer to George as coach Scarpelli because George, the Councilor, yes, great counsel, good friend, great advocate, but it's George Scarpelli, the man. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10132.48s">And</a> I think it says a lot about a person that's involved in a community behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10140.171s">You</a> know, and then gets involved maybe in politics or do something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10144.272s">So,</a> George, I wanna thank you for your many years of service to this community, but also to the youth and the disenfranchised and to the people that didn't have a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10156.255s">You</a> stood up, Councilor Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10158.595s">It</a> was you that stood up and made sure that this happened in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10162.776s">It</a> made sure that everyone felt welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10165.517s">And</a> I wanna thank you and I'll forever be beholden, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10172.5s">Council</a> President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10176.001s">I've</a> had more people say, when you talk, why do you say Mr. President all the time? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10180.341s">And</a> I say, that's out of deference and respect to Council President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10186.062s">You</a> know, talk about someone that's been involved in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10190.963s">I</a> mean, Rick Caraviello was involved in the community back 45 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10196.604s">I</a> remember when I first ran for public office, it was Rick Caraviello <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10202.237s">that</a> was sponsoring students, that was giving out part of all the civic organizations, giving out certificates and scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10212.039s">It</a> was Rick Caraviello that worked with families, that worked with families that had food insecurities and still does to today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10222.782s">He</a> didn't stop it when he became a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10225.677s">It</a> was Rick Caraviello was out in the community and he kept on doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10229.402s">And</a> that says a lot about a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10231.945s">He</a> didn't drop and say, ah, now I'm a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10234.789s">He</a> kept on doing what he always knew and that's helping people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10240.417s">You</a> wanna talk about helping people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10243.107s">You</a> turn around and it was Councilor Caraviello who led the charge to make sure veterans that were in need of home repair, that maybe couldn't afford to fix a leaky roof or add a handicap ramp to their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10258.32s">It</a> was Councilor Caraviello without any fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10261.202s">He</a> wasn't looking for any fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10262.523s">It</a> was Councilor Caraviello that stood up and made sure these things happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10268.35s">And</a> I will forever be grateful for your leadership over the many years, and I consider every one of my colleagues a friend, and I hope we maintain our friendships. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10282.801s">At</a> this particular point, I know I'm getting long-winded, but I wouldn't be myself if I didn't mention my friends for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10291.537s">And</a> this is probably where I get into a lot of trouble, but I'd like to recognize to the best of my ability, people that have been with me for three decades, or very close to three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10303.7s">And</a> people that put their trust in me, and I still don't understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10310.903s">But</a> people I consider my friends, and people that have been with me for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10315.384s">I</a> wanna thank in the front row, Bill and Jeannie Wilder, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10320.379s">been</a> with me for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10325.942s">I</a> want to thank Jim Silva. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10328.122s">I</a> want to thank Ray Cipriani, who's in the front row. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10333.885s">I</a> want to thank Ray Scarfo, John Puccio, John Pompeo, Gwen Blackburn, Bill Polcari, Bill Carr Jr., Henry Milleran, Charlie Cohen, Tony D'Antonio, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10349.711s">Mo</a> Sheehan, Mark Frangillo, Marsha and Dennis Karen, Gus Napoli, Milva Ricci, Maureen Kaczynski, Sharon Diesso, who's in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10365.88s">Johnny</a> Amari, the mayor of Salt Medford, the Mahoney family. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10370.579s">the</a> Cangiano family, the Albanese family, the Bailey family, Steve Ionesa, Marie Rizzo, Joanne Crotty, Marianne Howell, Betty Rawson, Diane Incanieri, Alan Maturana, Andrew Castagnetti, who is in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10389.785s">Anthony</a> Crescenti, who is in

Federico, and Howie Cohen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10410.398s">If</a> I miss some people, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10415.638s">I</a> wanna welcome the incoming members of the council, Justin and Kit Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10421.342s">I</a> wish you good luck in the upcoming two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10426.585s">I'm</a> proud to be part of such a great and welcoming and inclusive community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10432.168s">I</a> wanna wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10437.732s">May</a> God bless our nation and may God bless the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10442.474s">So</a> long for now.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_LV3E3edqaKU/2024-11-19_LV3E3edqaKU.html">City Council 12-14-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=890.932s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=894.493s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=896.146s">Ellen,</a> if you could just clarify, out of the 6,500 properties that are above the break-even point, do you have a breakdown on what type of classification those properties are? <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=911.013s">If</a> I live in a two-family, am I eligible if I own a two-family?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=968.303s">So</a> just so I understand, how are we counting? <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=971.665s">If</a> someone has a two family and they live on half the two family and they rent the other side, that rental would not be considered, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1020.648s">Right,</a> and is that state statute or is that just how each community handles it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1055.875s">Right,</a> I'm just trying to figure out what the number that 6,500 is compromised of.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1068.979s">The</a> breakeven number, the number of properties that are above the breakeven point.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1100.312s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1101.473s">So</a> someone has a three family, they rent out two of the units, they're still eligible for a residential exemption.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1112.649s">Even</a> though it becomes a moneymaker, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1115.891s">I</a> mean, the property is now a moneymaking property and not a residential type situation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1167.182s">We</a> all know the cost savings would <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1169.795s">probably</a> not be passed on to the renters, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1173.02s">If</a> someone received a residential exemption, I'm sure they're not gonna lower the rents based on what exemption they're receiving.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1191.863s">We</a> would hope that's the case, but I don't think it's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1195.384s">I</a> support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1197.165s">I</a> support having this reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1201.067s">I've</a> mentioned in the past <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1202.758s">that</a> because this affects a number of property owners that currently live in their property, they would pay a higher rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1211.162s">That's</a> one reason why in the past I did not support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1215.864s">But</a> I think at some point we're getting close to a number that may make sense in this community to give people, you said $636 savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1226.828s">And</a> this economy would go a long way to assisting those people, seniors and people on fixed incomes and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1234.951s">So</a> I think, you know, maybe not this go around, but eventually I think we're going to hit that point where this makes all but sense to support in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1246.696s">And</a> if you look at the surrounding communities that probably have a higher rate of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1254.828s">non-owner</a> occupied, it makes sense for them, like Malden and Cambridge and Chelsea and Everett, it probably makes sense for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1264.251s">I</a> don't think we're quite at that point quite yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1268.112s">So</a> that's why I will not be supporting this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1271.253s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1751.794s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1755.957s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1757.238s">And</a> I want to thank Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1760.922s">He's</a> been consistent over the past 19 years about bringing this residential exemption forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1769.609s">And</a> I want to thank him because I think I'll speak just for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1776.555s">I</a> won't speak for anyone else behind the real. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1778.911s">I</a> think the intention of this particular general law has great merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1786.494s">However,</a> in our community at this particular point, due to the breakeven point, it leaves thousands of people that live in owner-occupied property to pay a higher tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1801.866s">And</a> I just find that unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1804.108s">And</a> even though it benefits the majority, which Mr. Cassidy is correct, it may benefit the 80% that will receive a property reduction, tax reduction, I am concerned equally <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1818.382s">about</a> the 20% that live in their property that may be property rich because they bought their home 40 years ago and their assessed value is over the $705,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1829.865s">However,</a> they're going to pay a higher tax because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1838.476s">You</a> know, so I still have a concern with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1841.239s">The</a> numbers, if we were talking, you know, a handful of people that were above the threshold, it would make that decision much easier for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1851.449s">But</a> when you're talking thousands of people in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1855.172s">that</a> are above the threshold will pay a higher amount, I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1861.215s">And</a> I hope Mr. Cassidy can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1864.277s">And</a> I'm hoping someday I'll be joining him on the other side of the real advocating for this and pushing for this at the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1873.401s">And,</a> you know, so I want to thank him for his advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1877.146s">Anything</a> that helps seniors and people on fixed incomes, I think is a worthy cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1883.074s">And</a> I know this is why Mr. Castagnetti has pushed this for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1888.781s">So</a> I just wanted to thank him, but that is my reasoning, Mr. Castagnetti, that I will not be supporting this tonight because it leaves out far too many residents that I think are in the same boat, that deserve some tax relief, and that will only experience a tax increase with this change. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1911.359s">And</a> I'm not willing to do that at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1913.501s">But</a> I thank you for your advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=1915.843s">Thank</a> you, Councilmember Max.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_rk0Z0EFoxP4/2024-11-19_rk0Z0EFoxP4.html">City Council 12-07-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1186.418s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and Faye, I wanna welcome you to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1189.72s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1190.381s">You</a> have a very large endeavor before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1194.184s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1194.765s">And</a> I wish you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1195.766s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1197.859s">The</a> question I have, the first one is very basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1201.38s">When</a> do we anticipate for the city of Medford to officially take over parking responsibilities?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1217.283s">So</a> we don't have when this contract, because it was a 10-year contract.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1226.073s">The</a> way I understand it was the 10-year with at year seven, the option to renew for three years.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1254.909s">Okay</a> my understanding is that it was a 10-year contract with a <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1258.772s">option</a> to renew on year seven, which we're at right now at the end of December. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1263.033s">So</a> the contract, as far as I know, ends January 1st, 2022.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1271.976s">So</a> is it safe to say that they will no longer be providing any type of resident permit parking or business enforcement as of January 6th, 2022?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1288.042s">Okay,</a> so we don't officially know when the city is going to take this over.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1320.641s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1321.681s">And</a> I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1322.622s">I</a> know you've only been here six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1323.782s">So</a> that's correct.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1335.948s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1337.188s">So</a> just a point of information that on the last contract, that happened to be part of the last contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1344.572s">And</a> when we were presented with the contract, it was then Mayor McGlynn at the time, he asked us, I believe it was a 10 year contract, but if you say seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1354.576s">It</a> is seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1356.097s">That's</a> fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1358.098s">And</a> the one, honestly, one regret I have in public office for all the years I've served, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1366.22s">was</a> the fact that I voted on that contract prior to knowing, let me just say, prior to knowing what the actual program rollout was gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1378.817s">And</a> if I had the hindsight before I took the vote, knowing that the mayor was going to do kiosk on the streets, and the mayor wasn't gonna take it in-house, and the mayor was gonna do a number of things that were outside of the original recommendations by the committee that he formed, I wouldn't have voted on the actual terms of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1402.106s">And</a> I think what we're facing here again tonight, to be quite frank, is the administration coming to us saying that they're allowed to do a three-year contract on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1412.091s">They</a> don't need the approval of the Medford City Council, but we wanna extend it to five years because it makes more financial sense to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1422.117s">And</a> I don't doubt that, and I don't question that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1424.798s">What</a> I do question is that the longer we extend the contract, the longer this council
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1490.743s">And</a> I don't doubt that for a second, Faye. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1493.064s">I</a> guess what I'm trying to say is that we really don't know, other than the two contracts that you're asking us to approve tonight, we really don't know what this parking program consists of. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1505.415s">other</a> than the fact that we did receive a report back so many months ago from the Parking Policy and Enforcement Commission who did Yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1515.22s">I</a> know there's a couple of the co-chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1517.642s">Jim</a> Silver is in the audience, Mari Carroll, and they did Yeoman's work putting together a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1524.345s">So</a> in many of the recommendations, they put together a laundry list of recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1529.769s">So</a> I just want to caution my fellow colleagues that a vote on this tonight, asking for a five-year contract, the vehicle end of it may be a little different because it's strictly vehicles, but the agreement number two, which deals with the management system, hardware, enforcement money, and so forth, really gets into the nuts and bolts of how to run a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1556.467s">And</a> I've been down this avenue once before, and I just want to caution my colleagues that I think we're going down this avenue again prematurely, even though you need this to take place to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1569.697s">I</a> understand your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1572.138s">from</a> my standpoint as someone that fielded the calls and someone that ultimately had some responsibility in the last program as someone that voted for the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1582.921s">I</a> regret doing so because of the many things that I did not support in the rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1589.222s">And</a> it's unfortunate that you have to vote for this and then hope that you are in line with the rollout because you may be in total disagreement with the rollout, but then your name is going to get associated with <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1602.062s">Well,</a> you supported it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1604.305s">So</a> I just want to caution my colleagues on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1607.268s">And,</a> you know, they'll do what they like, but I just want to caution them on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1613.136s">Fay,</a> I don't expect you to answer this, but <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1617.94s">Oh,</a> maybe you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1619.962s">As</a> Councilor Falco mentioned, there were $350,000 put in last year's budget for the creation of a parking management program in the city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1660.844s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1662.008s">So</a> during the budget deliberations, I asked the then Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, was this figure of 350,000 just a placeholder, or do you really think you can run a parking program in the city of this size? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1680.175s">with</a> 900 and I think it's 87 business meters and hundreds of permit parking streets, which someday may go up to the full number of 750 odd streets that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1691.819s">Do</a> you feel he could run a full fledged program? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1695.761s">And</a> he unequivocally said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1698.222s">And</a> this was a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1701.583s">Knowing</a> we're already six months into the fiscal year, what would you envision <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1708.387s">a</a> full-fledged parking program cost in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1713.153s">Given</a> that any thought, do you have any idea?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1738.546s">Right,</a> right, but again, from an administrative standpoint, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1742.7s">If</a> I were gonna say, you know what, we're gonna take parking in-house and we're gonna do it in-house moving forward January 6th, you would think you would have an idea of an actual cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1758.266s">You</a> think you would have an idea, is this program something that's self-sustaining? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1762.108s">Could</a> the city run this program based on the revenue they bring in? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1768.244s">you</a> know, what the actual cost may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1771.045s">So</a> I think it's hard for me to understand that the mayor said, you know what, we're moving forward with the parking program in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1779.406s">I</a> just have no idea how much it's gonna cost.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1792.047s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1792.587s">And</a> you've been on board for six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1794.368s">This</a> has been in process for almost two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1797.609s">So</a> just so you know, this has been in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1800.03s">I</a> know you've only been here a month and a half, but this has been in process for almost two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1805.311s">And</a> the report was issued by the commission that the mayor put forward almost nine months ago with a lot of different recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1813.974s">I'm</a> just a little troubled at this point that we don't know when the program may start. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1819.376s">I</a> mean, we're three weeks before the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1821.896s">four</a> weeks before it's gonna end. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1823.898s">We</a> don't know when it's gonna start. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1825.759s">We</a> don't have a plan to roll out the program as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1830.443s">We</a> don't know what the actual costs may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1833.586s">So</a> it may be cost prohibitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1835.587s">Maybe</a> if we looked at this six months ago.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1839.971s">If</a> I could just finish.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1846.628s">Okay,</a> well, I'm just saying, we don't know that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1854.89s">You</a> couldn't tell me when the program's gonna start, you couldn't tell me what's gonna cost, but now you're sure of that it's not gonna cost labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1861.632s">I</a> could just finish.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1864.713s">That</a> wasn't a question, I'm speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1866.253s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1866.773s">And</a> I'd appreciate it if I have the ability to finish my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1870.834s">Sure,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1871.054s">Because</a> it throws my comments off when I get, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1874.055s">interrupted.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1875.016s">And</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1878.297s">So</a> I guess the concern I have at this particular point is that we're moving forward on a parking program that residents have been accustomed to for the past seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1890.909s">And</a> come January 6th, Mr. President, there's no one behind this rail that's gonna be able to tell any resident or any business owner that currently gets enforcement that that enforcement is gonna be continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1906.035s">There's</a> not one person behind this rail that can state that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1909.757s">And</a> that is a real concern of mine at this particular point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1915.622s">So</a> I want to make that known. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1917.723s">I</a> want to make it known back in the budget, when I brought it before the chief of staff at that point, that we weren't fully funding this program and that we were setting it up for failure at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1929.646s">He</a> said it was only a placeholder. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1931.527s">So</a> I just want to let that be known too, Mr. President, that there was an ample funding in the budget, even for a six month program, if we start in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1944.55s">The</a> other point, Mr. President, I want to raise is the Parking Policy and Enforcement Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1950.473s">Their</a> report that was issued to the mayor in March, and I believe formally came out in April, came out with a laundry list of recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1959.855s">Section</a> 2.1 had a laundry list summary of recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1964.459s">And</a> some of the recommendations that were made by this commission over the last nine months, I think should have been at least reviewed by the administration and potentially worked on by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1979.851s">And</a> I'm not sure if Faith can speak to any of this tonight, and I don't expect you to, but there were a number of recommendations, Mr. President, that spoke about GLX parking recommendations in the Hillside and South Method area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1996.652s">that</a> the city should be working on, including business parking as well in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2003.538s">Pursuing</a> meters, not kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2006.06s">The</a> commission recommended a cost-benefit analysis on refurbishing the kiosk, replacing kiosks, or investing in new meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2015.621s">Now,</a> over the last nine months, I assume some of that work could have taken place, and I'm not sure if it did or didn't, but I'd like to hear from the administration over the last nine months if any of these recommendations were actually worked on <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2032.9s">that</a> were put forth by the mayor's commission on parking policy and enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2037.141s">There</a> was another recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2039.681s">As</a> we all know, Medford has 31% of our roads are private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2045.422s">And</a> a private way is the city is empowered to enforce safety violations like hydrants and handicap spots, but otherwise not permitted to enforce parking on private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2061.365s">So</a> if you have a third of the roads that the city can't do enforcement on, those residents deserve some type of plan before this gets rolled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2073.9s">They</a> also deserve the right to be at the table to make sure their concerns are heard, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2083.253s">The</a> recommendations that were offered by the commission, bullet six under 2.1, was to create a communication plan for residents living on private ways to clearly outline the city's traffic and parking safety enforcement responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2100.576s">So</a> based on the GLX parking recommendations for the hillside assault method and the businesses in that district, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2109.945s">Whether</a> or not the city was going to pursue the meters or kiosks, fix the existing ones, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2117.107s">replaced</a> existing ones or add new meters, and then the creation of a communication plan for residents living on private ways, I think are very important items that this administration has nine months to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2131.335s">And</a> Faye, I don't know if you are familiar with that or if the interim chief of staff is familiar, but I'd like to know if there's been any action on the commission's recommendations.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2368.748s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2370.3s">So</a> Mr. President, and thank you for your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2372.221s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2374.782s">Currently</a> right now, the parking enforcement office does not handle every street for permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2382.984s">We</a> don't have citywide permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2385.265s">So</a> it's my understanding and members of the commissioner here, but their recommendation was to look into citywide permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2395.788s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2398.214s">You</a> know what we're asking now is to have Faye. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2403.822s">and</a> her team, which is Faye, right, it's Faye, to expand from a model that is already established, that already has a manager, underlings that do the enforcement, underlings that do the maintenance of the machines, systems already set up, and now we're asking Faye to take over a whole system and also increase the system by adding more than half the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2432.943s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2433.203s">So,</a> so phase, not going to do what Park Methods doing phase going to do almost double the parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2440.552s">If</a> we go citywide permit parking, then what currently exists right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2445.322s">Also,</a> when we rolled out the plan back so many years ago, it was somewhat of a pilot program because we only did certain business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2453.984s">How</a> do you start parking enforcement and say, okay, for West Method, we're gonna enforce, but certain parts of Salem Street, we're not gonna enforce the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2464.807s">And</a> we're gonna allow people to park in front of your business with no fear of getting a ticket, because there's no meters, but this other business, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2473.133s">You</a> know, they may lose potential business because they have meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2477.818s">So</a> it was never rolled out fairly in my opinion, and it was only partly rolled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2483.584s">Now</a> we're going to ask, because I assume this is going to be rolled out citywide, now we're going to ask Faye and her team of Faye. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2491.272s">to</a> roll out business parking citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2495.234s">So</a> we're gonna almost double the work again, or maybe close to it, on doing business parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2504.14s">So</a> I think what we're doing right now is adding a lot more to face plate than even our current vendor had on their plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2513.706s">And</a> I don't think it's realistic at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2517.528s">I</a> don't understand how we're gonna get a program off and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2521.48s">My</a> layman's opinion, Fay, you have a lot more experience, but my layman's opinion, to get a program like this up and running in the community at the current capacity, to take it in-house, I think you'd be talking three, four, five months to get it up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2536.821s">a</a> full-fledged program, my own opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2539.423s">You</a> can tell me otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2541.684s">Also,</a> Mr. President, as part of the recommendations by the commission, they brought up a valid point that Councilor Scarpelli brought up some while back, and it was regarding outstanding money owed to Park Method and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2560.345s">And</a> one of the recommendations under 2.1 bullet three was to pursue action as allowed in the contract with Republic Parking to collect the $1.6 to $2 million outstanding parking fees owed to park method program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2578.178s">And</a> bullet point four was for the city to work to collect a minimum of 50% of the outstanding fees owed to PAC method. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2586.766s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2587.066s">Because</a> it's in the city's best interest to collect those fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2591.511s">Has</a> there been any movement on the collection of these fees over the past nine months since the recommendation of the commission?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2852.223s">know</a> what's been discussed and also to know that if we're talking about transitioning from one to another, there's been no transition happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2865.168s">And,</a> you know, to be here three or four weeks, and I'm not saying you Faye, so don't take this personally, but to come before us three or four weeks before <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2874.508s">we're</a> supposed to start a new program and have all these unanswered questions, I think is being disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2882.229s">Because</a> this work should have been taking place over the last nine months to a year, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2888.651s">This</a> work should have been really undertaken during that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2892.531s">And</a> now is when you come before us saying, this is what we plan on doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2896.192s">This</a> is what the costs will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2897.772s">This</a> is when we plan on taking the program over. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2901.733s">I</a> understand you've been here six weeks, but I'm not hearing any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2905.457s">And</a> I just want to make sure that we're not setting ourselves up for failure come January 6th, when people expect a small transition to the city enforcement, because that's what they've been hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2918.088s">The</a> city's going to undertake the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2920.13s">We're</a> taking it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2922.452s">And</a> when that transition doesn't happen and it's not smooth, I think people are gonna be concerned and members of the council are gonna feel the phone calls and say, well, you supported this program, you voted for the contract, why did you allow this, this and this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2937.24s">And</a> I just wanna make sure, I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer, but I wanna make sure that the residents of this community are well aware when this will take place <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2949.115s">how</a> it will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2950.676s">And</a> you talk about in community involvement, it's three weeks prior to this going live. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2956.819s">I</a> mean, even if you got community involvement, you know, are you gonna take the recommendations from the community or is it just to say we had a community meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2967.245s">And</a> I know that's not the case, but it seems to me sometimes, you know, you have a community meeting just to have a community meeting and say, well, we did that, we done that, we solicited input. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2978.911s">So</a> in order to have meaningful input and having business owners, the chamber, and other vested interests in the community be part of the conversation and able to affect change, I don't think the leeway and time given is enough, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2998.324s">I</a> don't think it's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2999.504s">I</a> think this should have started many months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3004.226s">You</a> know, I wish the program well, but I don't see it happening, Mr. President, come January 6th or even several months after January 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3015.729s">And</a> I think there's a lot of questions that were posed or recommendations by the Enforcement Commission that was appointed by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3024.252s">that</a> really haven't been properly vetted, haven't been properly looked at, and in my opinion, sets us back even further in getting a full-fledged parking program in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3040.312s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3041.173s">I</a> want to thank... I just want to... I'm not critical of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3044.395s">I</a> wish you well, but there are a lot of things that I think led up to this moment and where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3052.181s">And</a> there's so many unknowns right now, and I think there should be more of an indication on a path <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3058.884s">in</a> a general direction and something to look at and say, this is what we believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3062.908s">We're</a> going to go to meters now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3064.49s">We</a> don't like the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3065.991s">We're</a> taking it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3067.453s">We're</a> doing zone parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3070.336s">We're</a> doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3071.537s">I</a> think there should have been more of a plan presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3074.82s">before</a> you come to the council and say, we want an extension of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3080.081s">We</a> want more than three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3081.841s">So</a> if you set up a program that I'm not proud of, why would I want to give you five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3087.543s">Why</a> would I want to give you 10 years on that program? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3089.483s">I</a> want to give you the least amount of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3091.463s">And</a> the state allows you to do three years on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3094.524s">Why</a> would I want to extend that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3096.264s">So</a> to me, I think we're safer as a council saying, take the three years that you have the option without a vote on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3104.206s">And</a> then in a few years, come back and we'll take a look at it and see how successful what has been offered policies and procedures and how this is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3113.671s">And</a> then maybe you go for five or 10 year plan after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3117.253s">So</a> that would be my recommendation to members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3120.715s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President for indulging.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3539.556s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3542.977s">I</a> was hoping those weren't the words.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3545.286s">I</a> was hoping those weren't the words we were gonna hear tonight because I had a sneaky suspicion, Mr. President, that the mayor could move forward with a three-year contract on her own. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3557.757s">Doesn't</a> need to come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3560.019s">Can</a> start this program on her own right now, move forward three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3564.783s">No</a> one's making anyone wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3567.49s">But</a> bringing the council into it to extend it to five years, Mr. President, all of a sudden creates a scapegoat that, oh, if the council doesn't approve the five years, we may not be able to get parking enforcement up and running because the council is standing in the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3584.087s">Meanwhile,</a> it's three weeks, Mr. President, before this program should take effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3589.152s">Three</a> weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3590.453s">So</a> I would caution my colleagues, Mr. President, that we shouldn't be listed as a scapegoat here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3596.996s">The</a> mayor has the authority to move forward on a three-year contract and should do so if they believe for one second that this program will not be a smooth transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3608.08s">That</a> is up to the administration if they want to move forward, Mr. President, not up to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3613.923s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3676.077s">So</a> if you don't get the vote tonight for five years, this program will be seamless and you'll keep on moving forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3711.885s">Right,</a> so you don't have what the cost difference is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3715.05s">I</a> provided the three and the five year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3720.852s">Right,</a> but no one knows how much more it's gonna cost, if indeed it will cost more. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3725.314s">To</a> me, again, Mr. President, honestly, with all due respect, I will not support this tonight because the administration can move forward with the three-year contract on their own, Mr. President, and I wish them well doing so, but this council does not know how this program's gonna run, and I don't see how anyone behind this reel can vote on allowing this to take place <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3751.187s">without</a> the proper protocols in place to safeguard the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3756.048s">And</a> even though we may not be responsible, as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, for the nuts and bolts of creating policy and procedure and so forth, you're allowing for the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3766.611s">So</a> you're allowing for the five-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3768.831s">Therefore,</a> you are giving the green light to go ahead on whatever results from this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3773.892s">Whatever</a> the results are, you're allowing that to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3777.333s">So</a> I guess you can say indirectly you are responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3781.279s">And</a> that's how I see it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3782.781s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3914.853s">I</a> just think that- Mr. President, if I could just follow up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3918.794s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3920.034s">I</a> appreciate the vice president's comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3922.276s">I</a> think he hit the nail on the head when he said we shouldn't be talking about this program failing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3928.801s">What</a> program? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3931.283s">What</a> plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3933.305s">Show</a> me one paper that has a plan or a program of anything regarding parking enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3941.271s">Show</a> it to me tonight and I'll vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3943.813s">There's</a> not one plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3947.322s">laid</a> out, other than the fact that they want to sign a couple of contracts, which I agree that stuff, they said it right, that stuff is needed to set up a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3957.852s">But</a> with three to four weeks out, and there's not one piece of paper in front of me to say how they're going to operate a parking program in this community, not one piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3969.543s">So</a> you're right, I can't speak to failure because I can't see what's gonna fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3973.526s">There's</a> nothing here to make an educated, informed decision on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3979.497s">And</a> that's what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3980.838s">We're</a> here, Mr. President, to be the safeguard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3984.339s">And,</a> you know, as Council Vice President mentioned, you know, I don't want to blow my own horn, Mr. President, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3991.142s">It</a> was back many, many, many years ago, many years ago, when this city did zero enforcement and they wanted to build a parking garage on Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4002.086s">We</a> all remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4004.41s">after</a> the old one came into disrepair and had to be taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4009.793s">And</a> the reason why this council said we weren't gonna move forward a parking garage is because we truly couldn't understand the parking needs in this community because people could park anywhere they wanted in any of our business districts for eight to 10 hours, take the bus into town and never pay a nickel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4028.488s">And</a> at the time, members of this council said, how are we going to establish a pay to park garage? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4034.81s">where</a> you could park anywhere in the city and not ever be in fear of getting a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4039.092s">It's</a> not gonna work having to pay to park garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4042.034s">So</a> our recommendation was put together a parking management program in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4048.317s">Then</a> we would consider a parking garage in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4051.358s">And</a> that's exactly what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4053.459s">And</a> then at the time, Mayor McGlynn, who we didn't see eye to eye on anything, Mr. President, appointed me to the parking commission <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4061.383s">to</a> oversee parking enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4064.624s">And</a> that's why it was established. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4066.644s">So</a> we can have people sitting behind this rail, looking in the sky and doing whatever they want, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4072.345s">But</a> that's how it was implemented in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4076.406s">And</a> I wanna make sure that we're not just here to do a quick rush to judgment, Mr. President, that we do our homework and due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4084.668s">I'm</a> not gonna be behind this rail in three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4087.028s">So</a> I can go like this and brush my hands off. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4089.669s">But</a> I want to make sure this community is not left out in the lurch. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4093.473s">And</a> right now, what we're hearing right now from the administration, there's no plan for parking enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4100.701s">And</a> I'm not prepared to vote tonight, Mr. President, on giving an extension to a contract that doesn't present any facts, figures, dollars amount, dollar amount, nothing at all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4111.984s">Maybe</a> other members of the council who wanna stick their head in the sand once again could do so, but I'm not gonna do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4118.845s">That's</a> not how I operate.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5050.186s">When</a> you talk about hardware that's going to be purchased, what assumptions are being made in regards to the type of enforcement that we're going to do in this community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5080.177s">So</a> I'm thinking more of a basic, G-Tech provides a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5086.201s">Naturally,</a> they don't know what type of program we wanna run in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5091.292s">Correct,</a> so it's something that we have to explain to them, hey, we're looking to do X, Y, and Z. Correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5098.036s">So</a> in order to explain to them what we're trying to do, I assume the city has some assumptions on what type of enforcement we'd like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5107.822s">Are</a> we doing citywide enforcement? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5110.765s">Are</a> we going to be doing kiosks, meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5113.567s">Are</a> we going to be doing overnight parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5117.83s">What</a> type of enforcement? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5118.971s">So</a> I'd like to know what type of assumptions are being made based on the purchase of this hardware.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5148.333s">Right,</a> so how many handheld devices are we gonna purchase? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5152.474s">One</a> per parking control specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5155.515s">So</a> an assumption's made that we're gonna have how many parking enforcement clerks?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5162.937s">You're</a> gonna have five, and that will cover us citywide?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5167.378s">And</a> that will cover us 24-7 in permit parking and so forth?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5172.859s">And</a> that will cover us on weekends?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5177.155s">Okay,</a> and the readers on the back of the vehicles now that do the plate readers that do the... Are you talking about LPR? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5186.0s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5186.86s">Those</a> plate readers, are we gonna continue the same process that Park Medford is using or are we gonna do something different?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5266.046s">So</a> that was just excellent information because I think you're letting us in on what we're gonna eventually do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5274.553s">And</a> it seems like now we're carrying out what currently is there and eventually you may move on.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5309.346s">And</a> one of the biggest concerns we've had over the last couple of years is signage in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5315.543s">And</a> even the mocking of spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5317.884s">If</a> you go clearly you'll see and even in the square and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5321.705s">There's</a> no delineation between spaces, and so I've noticed that in some areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5325.846s">Yes,</a> right, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5326.966s">So,</a> so there's a large concern with that is that something that you're working in conjunction with DPW now to take a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5334.742s">because</a> they do signage and responsible for markings and so forth?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5353.008s">Okay,</a> and regarding resident permit parking citywide,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5373.147s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5373.827s">And</a> what about regarding making sure every business district has kiosks or parking meters <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5380.992s">and</a> not just select business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5382.834s">So</a> is that for parity? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5384.656s">Is</a> that, is that something we're going to be looking at to make sure?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5480.01s">Mr.</a> President, were there two separate agreements? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5483.996s">I</a> think it would be wise to take two separate votes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5487.641s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5507.922s">I'd</a> like my vote to reflect, Mr. President, the records that I am in opposition based on the fact that I think there should be a three-year contract, which the mayor is allowed to do unilaterally and not involve this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5522.15s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6008.493s">And</a> what about appeals? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6009.794s">Are</a> we doing anything on appeals?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6020.627s">One</a> person does the appeals? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6021.988s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6022.989s">And</a> that's enough to handle that in the city?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7416.962s">Marianne,</a> how long will these positions be funded for with the APA money? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7421.266s">APA's</a> three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7422.467s">Three</a> years? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7424.154s">And</a> is there any thought after the three years if these positions will be kept on or?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7442.56s">And</a> my other question, this may be a question for the interim chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7446.921s">As</a> part of the APA funding, I was under the impression that frontline workers and first responders <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7453.33s">could</a> receive enumeration for their work during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7458.734s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7477.738s">Well,</a> I guess my concern is that, you know, we're two years into COVID now, and if there's funding available for first responders and frontline workers, you know, the people that worked at CVS during the toughest of times, you know, our fire police, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7494.168s">EMT</a> workers, people that work at Stop and Shop and any other stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7498.632s">I</a> think really we should do our best to free up some of that money and make sure whatever we dole out is done pretty immediate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7506.938s">So</a> I would hope that's something the city administration is looking at and will take care of the first responders and frontline workers as soon as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7516.705s">Is</a> it the intent of the administration to dole that money out to those workers?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7594.19s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7595.552s">I</a> just want to make sure there's a commitment from the city administration to move forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7600.598s">I've</a> read in the newspaper and seen on local news that there are many surrounding communities that are moving forward currently right now with frontline workers and first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7611.378s">And</a> I would hope that we're in the process as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7613.92s">And</a> I realize there's a process to doing so, but I just want to make sure the commitment's there because, you know, we relied on these frontline workers and first responders for the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7626.412s">And</a> these are the people in the community that aren't making large corporate salaries and put their life on the line to make sure that we had food and medicine and everything else access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7639.615s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate that we now take care of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7643.836s">And</a> I'd really like to see some action on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7646.677s">So</a> maybe if you can go back to the mayor and let her know that members of this council would like to see that happen.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7655.297s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7886.853s">It's</a> insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7887.574s">I</a> never get to speak at this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7890.45s">Unbelievable.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7923.09s">No,</a> you are a disruption, Adam.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=8023.928s">Mr.</a> President, December 28th, I believe we have a council meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=8032.673s">Is</a> it a regularly scheduled meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=8034.314s">If</a> not, I'd like to ask that we cancel the regularly scheduled meeting of December 28th.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_Cs57SkaizpQ/2024-11-19_Cs57SkaizpQ.html">City Council 11-23-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=544.172s">Thank</a> you Mr. President, I want to thank you for co-sponsoring this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=549.256s">I</a> offer this resolution tonight Mr. President to get some clarification on some recent happenings within the City Clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=561.825s">and</a> the registrar voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=565.129s">As</a> you may or may not be aware, the election process this year, during both the preliminary election and the general election in November, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=577.49s">were</a> called into question regarding the review of voter list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=583.632s">And</a> it's my belief that the Secretary of State's office, in particular the election division, was reviewing a list that was submitted by the city back a few months ago to inactivate a number of registered voters in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=607.352s">Now,</a> that process, I am not aware of where it stands, and that's the reason why I'm offering this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=615.318s">However,</a> what I am aware, and not through any formal communication from <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=621.476s">the</a> city administration is that there is currently an external third party audit that's being taken place, I guess, as we speak by an external party of which I believe it was initiated by KP Law, who is a vendor, nothing more than a vendor for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=651.621s">So</a> I'm not quite sure the KP law has the authority to initiate an audit on a department within <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=663.366s">city</a> government here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=665.207s">That's</a> the first question I would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=668.289s">And</a> secondly, the extent of what this audit is going to involve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=672.793s">I'm</a> under the impression it involves the city clerk's office slightly, mostly the registrar voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=682.641s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, where we are responsible for hiring of the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=691.067s">The</a> city clerk in his capacity is not only the city clerk, he's also the chief election officer under our charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=699.713s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate that we as the hiring authority <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=704.957s">find</a> out why KP Law, a contractor that works for the city authorized an external party to come in and do an audit of the city clerk's slash registrar voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=722.213s">So</a> at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that we have a committee of the whole meeting to bring us up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=730.307s">I</a> would assume, and I wasn't privy to any of these meetings that were held over the last couple of weeks, but I would assume we would have to invite someone from the city administration and they would be aware of who actually should be invited and who took part in these meetings that were held that the Medford City Council was not privy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=756.061s">Mr.</a> President, in order to ask the questions I have, I won't ask them tonight, but I have a laundry list of questions on where this audit stands, why it was initiated, by who, for what purpose, Mr. President, and the list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=772.24s">So</a> that's what I'm gonna put in the form of a motion that we set up a committee of the whole meeting within the next, and I realize it's the holiday, but maybe sometime after Thanksgiving, Mr. President, if we could set that up, a committee of the whole meeting to discuss the ongoing audit that's being done in the clerk slash elections department.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=795.345s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=911.386s">And</a> I appreciate that update. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=913.508s">And</a> I know you weren't part of all the meetings that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=917.591s">However,</a> to me, the larger issue is how does a vendor, this is a vendor, initiate an audit of a city department? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=931.723s">I</a> don't think there's any precedent anywhere that a vendor would have that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=936.695s">So</a> that's my first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=939.823s">Who</a> and what capacity does KP law have to initiate <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=947.648s">I</a> call it an audit, you could call it a review.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=953.933s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=954.674s">So</a> that would be my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=958.757s">And</a> prior to anything happening, Mr. President, where the only authority that we have for hiring in this community, out of the hundreds of positions, we're responsible for the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=973.542s">One</a> position, we're not even responsible for the people that work within the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=980.188s">We</a> have no hiring authority over the people that actually work for the city clerk, but our one responsibility is the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=989.877s">And</a> he runs the day-to-day operations of the clerk's office and is responsible for the oversight of the registrar of voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1000.637s">How</a> are we not brought into the conversation when a review slash audit is requested by a vendor, as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, that may not even be a vendor because we slashed them from the budget in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1023.317s">So</a> there's a lot that needs to be answered, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1026.538s">I</a> hope we can get those answers answered tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1030.159s">We</a> had Mr. Salt up here tonight talking about, you know, who authorized private investigators to follow around DPW workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1042.102s">Was</a> that in the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1043.402s">These</a> are questions, Mr. President, that we need answered as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1048.443s">and</a> they're very important questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1050.225s">This</a> is one of them, Mr. President, and I would hope we set up that meeting immediately.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1057.612s">It</a> will be next week, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1059.694s">A</a> second question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1061.815s">We</a> pay our own city solicitor, Solicitor Kim Scanlon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1068.286s">who</a> served as assistant city solicitor for a number of years, a very capable attorney, very knowledgeable of city ordinances, city charter, but yet we have a private vendor that comes in and starts investigating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1088.071s">I</a> won't call it an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1090.232s">I</a> know they get a little antsy when we say investigation, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1096.282s">but</a> hires two clerks to come in and do a review slash audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1103.966s">Where's</a> our city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1106.007s">That's</a> supposed to be the oversight, the legal oversight for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1113.35s">Was</a> this signed off by the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1118.768s">So</a> I, right, so you can see where this is going, Mr. President, that we can have a rogue entity that has nothing to do with this community other than the fact that they're a hired vendor, stop auditing and investigating departments and employees and policies and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1141.748s">It</a> makes no sense at all, no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1148.091s">And</a> I realized this is a touchy subject because some of this was initiated because of an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1155.976s">And</a> the people that are running this community ran in that election and they have to probably recuse themselves from being involved in any review, which I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1170.008s">but</a> we don't leave it up to a vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1172.45s">We</a> don't leave it up to a vendor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1174.951s">That</a> makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1176.592s">So</a> really, I hope next week, I appreciate that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1180.815s">I</a> appreciate everything you've done on this issue to keep me as one member of the council informed to the best of your ability, but we really need answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1190.122s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2420.998s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2422.7s">Recently,</a> we lost a very good city employee, longtime DPW Director Brian Kearns, resigned from his position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2433.207s">Mr.</a> President, if anyone knew Brian, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2437.91s">knew</a> he was a dedicated worker in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2441.613s">He</a> was dedicated to doing his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2445.515s">He</a> was relentless when it came to supporting his fellow DPW workers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2454.021s">Brian,</a> in my opinion, probably had the toughest department head position in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2461.505s">From</a> my standpoint, I would probably contact Brian or his office with 90% of the calls that I received, because they dealt with DPW in some fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2475.372s">Brian</a> oversaw the pox. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2480.068s">highway</a> which included sidewalks and streets, the cemetery workers, water and sewer, forestry, and the list goes on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2490.113s">He</a> really did tremendous work with little funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2496.036s">And</a> that has been a topic of discussion by this council for a number of years to get more boots on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2503.8s">And</a> we've been somewhat successful, but not quite to the level that the residents in this community expect from a full-fledged DPW department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2517.166s">But</a> it wasn't because of Brian Kerins. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2519.587s">It</a> was Brian Kerins that was the glue to this operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2523.689s">and</a> kept it going for years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2526.873s">I</a> think it's sad to see Brian resign right before a major street sweep. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2535.172s">which</a> is kind of a big deal in this city and a big deal with DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2539.373s">I</a> think it's sad to see Brian resign right before a winter, which DPW plays an instrumental role in clearing our streets for public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2551.516s">I</a> think it's sad to see Mr. President, a department head with so much firsthand knowledge of the inner workings of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2561.745s">And</a> Brian knew every one of the 763 roads in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2567.508s">He</a> knew the infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2569.128s">He</a> was familiar with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2571.309s">And</a> that's going to be very difficult to replace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2574.45s">Extremely</a> difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2575.931s">We</a> know firsthand because there are a number of open positions that the city administration is trying to fill now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2582.954s">And</a> we hear far too often that there's just not the candidates out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2588.116s">There's</a> not the knowledge base that would be required in some of these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2593.359s">And</a> the director of DPW is definitely one of those positions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2599.537s">I</a> just want to thank him for his many years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2603.32s">No</a> matter when we had our meetings, Mr. President, whether it was this two Saturday, three Saturdays ago in the pouring rain, Brian Kearns was the first to show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2614.987s">He</a> was the first department head, Mr. President, to show up during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2620.1s">I</a> give him a lot of credit for that, Mr. President, because it was voluntary, whether you want to come on Zoom or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2626.823s">And</a> he was the first department to come up here and provide a little normality for, at least for the residents, and I believe for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2635.627s">So</a> I want to thank him for that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2638.228s">He</a> was always outgoing, someone that would tell you a good story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2642.47s">And</a> really, when you gave him things to work on, he got them done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2649.547s">He</a> got them done, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2651.749s">And</a> I want to thank him for all his years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2655.593s">I</a> know he doesn't live in the community, but I hope that this is not a loss that we hear from Mr. Kearns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2662.099s">And</a> it would have been great to have some type of transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2666.503s">You</a> know, when you have someone that's in a role of that importance, it's nice to hand it off to someone else, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2676.598s">And</a> I don't know if you can fill those shoes and how long will it take and how long will it take to bring someone up to snuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2684.824s">You</a> know, I just think it's a big loss for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2689.188s">And</a> I wish that it didn't work out this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2693.01s">I</a> wish Brian was still on with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2696.053s">However,</a> that wasn't my decision, but I want to thank him for his years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2699.715s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3081.362s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll, just to, if we can send Brian a citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3087.345s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3089.206s">And</a> to respond to Rick, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3093.866s">Rick,</a> Rick, because I think everyone that comes up to the podium ask questions that we can answer or try to answer deserves some type of response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3105.161s">It's</a> my understanding from the communication that I received from the city administration that Brian was asked to resign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3112.653s">and</a> he did indeed resign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3114.654s">That's</a> my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3116.795s">So</a> he stepped down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3118.636s">So</a> that's how it, I don't know for what purpose he was asked, you know, that I don't know, but that's my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3127.641s">And</a> I stand to be corrected if it's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3130.022s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3508.966s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3509.946s">I'm</a> just a little confused that the resolution reads that the Board of Health meet to reconsider the city's mask regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3519.642s">And</a> now you're saying just to clarify how they got to the point of what they've already done in their last meeting?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3541.293s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3542.174s">So</a> you're asking them to reconsider mass mandates <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3545.349s">in</a> local restaurants and businesses throughout the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3552.796s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3553.197s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3553.437s">I</a> just, I just want to make sure because the language I'm reading is very different than what you just stated.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3570.336s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3584.21s">I</a> and I think anyone should be held accountable and actually for a period of time we were having a board of health director appear before the Medford City Council, giving us, if not week weekly updates, you know, bi weekly updates, Mr. President, and that hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3602.207s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong, maybe in five, six months, seven months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3607.312s">And</a> I haven't heard any outcry from members of this council saying, where are our updates? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3613.696s">What's</a> going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3615.577s">In</a> the past, we heard we have to follow the science. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3619.28s">They</a> follow the science, and people are still upset because they want to make sure everyone has a mask no matter where they go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3628.005s">So</a> for a period of time, you need a mask to walk into a restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3634.395s">I</a> have to have my mask when I walk into Carol's, but as soon as I sit down, I take my mask off and I sit there and I eat for two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3644.899s">Not</a> sure what that science is, but that was the mandate that was out there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3652.702s">Now</a> I think we're at a situation right now where the board of health deems that a mask is not required in businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3661.077s">And</a> we're hearing that people wanna bring it back again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3666.139s">And</a> if we're gonna follow the science, let's follow it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3670.44s">Let's</a> be consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3672.601s">And</a> so I just wanna make sure we're consistent, Mr. President, whatever we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3679.043s">City</a> Hall, you still have to wear a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3682.504s">I</a> don't know where that science is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3683.944s">So</a> it's safe for me to go out to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3685.845s">When</a> I come in City Hall, I have to wear a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3688.145s">There's</a> giant auditorium here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3690.712s">where</a> you could social distance, you have to wear a mask, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3695.339s">Makes</a> no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3698.424s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3699.52s">Council</a> Member Rao.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3906.203s">So,</a> Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3908.165s">Council</a> Member Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3909.126s">So</a> I think we have to be mindful, right, that for the past almost two years, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3915.401s">every</a> business in this community has followed the rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3920.603s">No</a> matter how difficult it may have been for that establishment, they've followed the rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3927.165s">Now</a> the Board of Health is stating that it's all right to go into a restaurant without a mask on, according to their recommendations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3936.468s">It's</a> very different than City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3938.929s">You</a> know, City Hall doesn't even have to open the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3942.931s">You</a> know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3944.453s">The</a> money comes in through taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3946.154s">They</a> don't have to worry about opening the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3948.875s">It's</a> the local businesses that have to turn the key, get employees to come in and provide a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3957.76s">And</a> I think the more that we make it difficult for businesses to operate, Mr. President, it makes it increasingly difficult for people to make a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3967.926s">We're</a> going on almost two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3970.755s">So</a> in my opinion, I'm not gonna support this tonight, because I'm not gonna revisit anything that goes against the Board of Health's recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3978.704s">They</a> came up with their recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3980.706s">Now,</a> there are people in this community that feel that that's not the right recommendation, then don't go out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3988.054s">Don't</a> go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3988.834s">It</a> may sound insensitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3990.855s">Don't</a> go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3991.735s">I</a> had my two injections. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3993.496s">I</a> had my two shots. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3994.677s">My</a> whole family did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3996.137s">And</a> months later, we all were stricken with COVID, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=3999.398s">And</a> it wasn't because I didn't wear a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4001.599s">And</a> it wasn't because I didn't take the precautions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4004.54s">It's</a> because we really don't know about this virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4007.041s">We</a> really don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4009.402s">And</a> I think it's unfair to subject businesses, local mom-and-pop businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4014.704s">We're</a> not talking about Target or some of the big franchises. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4018.846s">We're</a> talking about local mom-and-pop businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4021.567s">And</a> I think to send a message out that we want to go backwards again, Mr. President, and to question the Board of Health, I think is a misstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4031.071s">I</a> really do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4033.712s">And</a> so I won't be supporting this Mr. President tonight, because I think we're following the science right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4039.537s">And</a> I think the science tells us that, you know, they saw something on the news the other night that 95% of the beds in Massachusetts are occupied in our hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4050.685s">But</a> I think the number, don't quote me on this, but I think 17% of the beds out of the 95% were COVID related. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4058.251s">Everything</a> else was people catching up from surgeries they postponed or things that, ailments that they had that they weren't going to the hospital for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4067.378s">And</a> that's what's driving the numbers in the hospital now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4070.46s">So,</a> you know, I just think we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4073.963s">you</a> know, move on the best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4075.884s">And</a> I think this would send a terrible message to our businesses, hundreds of businesses in the community, that we want to take a step backwards, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4085.806s">And</a> in my opinion, there's no need to at this point.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3453.996s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3454.816s">In</a> your professional opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3457.151s">Would</a> an oversight of that nature just say it's regarding not having sufficient coverage? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3464.715s">So</a> it only has two inches compared to three inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3468.837s">Is</a> that sufficient in nature to ask for a termination of contract?

that keeps on giving. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4688.85s">You</a> know, it never ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4690.651s">They've</a> been blasting, as they said, for I think three or four years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4695.573s">And</a> there was a law for a period of time, and I guess there was some confusion whether the developer could build certain amount of parcels and so forth, and whether you could expand or not, and whether they had an access road. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4707.16s">And</a> there was a lot of different questions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4709.821s">But</a> the one thing surprises me, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4712.904s">and</a> I've been to a number of community development board meetings, board of appeals meetings, and I've seen them reject projects in this city, Mr. President, for not having enough frontage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4724.393s">Oh,</a> you're two feet short frontage, the project goes nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4727.996s">Oh,</a> you don't have, you're missing three parking spots, the project goes nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4732.96s">However,</a> Mr. President, you have a project that's taken four years of blasting in a neighborhood, and it goes through with flying colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4742.632s">Think</a> about the biggest impact that you can have on a residential area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4747.239s">It's</a> not missing a parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4749.263s">It's</a> not a foot of frontage that may be missing, but blasting, as Councilor Morell mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4756.712s">We</a> advised all the residents in the area at the time to make sure if they don't do it, to have someone videotape the interior of their property, walls, ceilings, so they could have at least some proof, ultimately, if something does happen and foundations are shook or altered, Mr. President, that they'd have some proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4780.28s">And</a> I would hope that many residents took that advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4784.003s">But</a> the recourse is probably not going to be much, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4791.067s">I</a> just think this has gone on far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4793.909s">I</a> do have to say, Mr. President, when it originally started the blasting, that they weren't even cordoning off the sidewalks appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4801.474s">And</a> there was flying debris <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4803.675s">They</a> put tops down and heavy, heavy tops down to stop some of the debris, but there were rocks I had residents that live across the street, send me some of the rocks and other debris that filter down onto Winthrop and across with them street, very dangerous situation that I have to say has alleviated itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4823.231s">And</a> I think the developers doing a much better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4826.814s">and</a> securing the area, in my opinion, from what I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4830.035s">But</a> originally, that wasn't the case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4832.135s">So</a> I would hope that, you know, to me, the blasting should have been done over a set period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4838.437s">The</a> city should have said, okay, this is what we're going to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4841.797s">Nothing</a> outside of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4843.158s">We're</a> giving you a two-week, three-week, whatever it is, time frame, and nothing outside, because this developer cannot blast without the city's approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4851.299s">And,</a> you know, to leave it car blanche and open-ended, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4854.435s">to</a> me, creates this angst in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4857.397s">And</a> that's what we're seeing now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4859.438s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4862.4s">Council</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4930.961s">So</a> the city engineer, I think you're talking on the other side, you're talking with the Boston school, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5082.733s">Just</a> if I could, while we're on that subject, I just want to thank resident Chris Donovan, who lives across the street, took it upon himself, Mr. President, to go and speak with the developer of that particular lot, and he was able to sit down <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5098.357s">with</a> the developer and get some improvements in front of the high school and along that stretch of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5104.481s">And</a> this was just a resident on his own that reached out and said, how come you're not giving anything back to the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5110.184s">You're</a> causing all this disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5112.225s">And</a> he was able to set up a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5114.066s">I</a> think he includes the city administration, but it was thanks to Chris Donovan for setting that up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5120.13s">I</a> just want to thank him personally.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5153.139s">Mr.</a> President, suspension of the rules to take paper 21-551, communications from city offices employees.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5273.816s">Mr.</a> President, I would appeal that we were missed not to congratulate our new position.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5951.747s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5954.216s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5954.977s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5959.323s">This</a> was an issue I raised in June, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5962.92s">when</a> we were going through the fiscal budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5966.201s">And</a> I noticed that the mayor was taking this in-house and the parking budget, I think consisted of 300 and I wanna say $65,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5976.266s">And</a> at the time I raised the question to the chief of staff stating that how can he run a full fledged parking program for that amount of money? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5987.17s">And</a> he more or less said that was a startup or, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5991.917s">a</a> place card within the budget to get the program off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5996.539s">And</a> from what I'm seeing right now Mr. President is, I'm not hearing about any public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6002.761s">I'm</a> not hearing as Councilor Falco mentioned about any stakeholder meetings with the business community, the Chamber of Commerce, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6009.723s">with</a> area residents, with area businesses, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6014.106s">And</a> I can recall the days I sat on the original parking enforcement committee, that it was open and notorious. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6023.133s">And</a> there were ample meetings for everyone to give input. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6026.996s">My</a> concern, Mr. President, is that when you take a program of this nature in-house, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6032.605s">and</a> take over citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6034.927s">And</a> I think that's the ultimate question that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6039.51s">Does</a> the mayor intend to start the program as it was left off by Park Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6046.515s">So</a> are we gonna be patrolling all the resident permit parking streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6051.058s">that</a> are currently patrolled by Park Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6053.881s">That</a> would be my first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6055.543s">The</a> second question is the administration, and I believe it was the previous administration, put together a consultant that they hired that came in regarding resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6071.971s">And</a> they made a recommendation that they were going to start off doing a pilot program in Salt Method and the hillside, which never happened, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6081.917s">But</a> that was a recommendation made by the consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6084.919s">So</a> are we going to move towards some type of citywide permit parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6090.523s">And</a> when will that take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6092.806s">You're</a> talking, you have to think about it when you do enforcement, and we met with, I think it was seven or eight communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6098.993s">Originally,</a> when we were thinking about taking it in house, and you have to remember, there's enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6105.802s">So</a> you got to hire enforcement officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6108.405s">There's</a> collections. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6109.946s">So</a> the same people that are doing enforcement are not the people that are doing collections. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6115.608s">You</a> can't have that in a program, someone that's giving out tickets and also collecting the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6120.65s">Who's</a> going to be doing the hearings? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6122.793s">That</a> that's a big part of any type of parking enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6127.978s">And</a> then you have a maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6130.381s">So,</a> you know, there are four distinct departments within parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6136.067s">I</a> don't hear any discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6138.449s">other</a> than the hiring of a head of parking, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6142.353s">I</a> think that's a first step, but I think that step should have happened, honestly, a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6147.738s">And</a> over this past year, working on the eventual taking over of the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6154.764s">I</a> don't see how you do that in a month and a half, two month span. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6158.748s">I</a> really don't see how this is gonna take off, Mr. President, and be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6164.375s">I</a> think residents were sold a bill of goods that were taking this over in-house, but there's no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6172.52s">You</a> know, show me a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6175.441s">I'm</a> not opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6177.082s">I</a> want to see a plan in place and give us something to look forward to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6181.364s">And</a> so those are the questions that I have, Mr. President, that I think need to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6187.266s">And,</a> you know, if we're looking at taking this on and if we're looking at having a full-fledged parking enforcement department, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6196.91s">Right</a> now, our parking, if you notice, we don't have kiosks in every business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6203.072s">So</a> there are some business districts that have kiosks, and those particular businesses are subjected to someone coming out, feeding the kiosk, or they're subjected to someone saying, I'm not going to go to that particular business, because I can go to this other business that provides the same service, and I don't have to pay for a kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6221.336s">So</a> there were some inequities in the original program and we were sold a bill of goods that that was phase one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6228.519s">Now</a> that was some 10 years ago, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6230.66s">That</a> was phase one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6232.161s">The</a> city never rolled out phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6235.443s">It's</a> like the street sweeping program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6237.644s">We're</a> still working on a pilot program for street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6241.645s">I</a> think we've had a pilot program since I've been on the council, 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6245.307s">We're</a> working on a pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6247.857s">I</a> think we're past the pilot program now, and this is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6251.839s">We</a> started off with a parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6253.92s">We</a> didn't implement it citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6255.821s">We</a> only did certain business districts, which made no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6260.563s">We</a> have kiosks now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6262.024s">Is</a> the mayor gonna go to meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6263.825s">We</a> heard the outcry when the kiosks were in the streets, that they were too complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6269.248s">There</a> were problems reading the screens and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6271.749s">Are</a> we going to a double-headed meter? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6274.965s">You</a> know, how is this program going to operate? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6277.127s">I</a> think people have the right to know, Mr. President, that if we're taking this in house, so, um, you know, I'm not gonna be on the council when this gets rolled out, but I could tell members that are new to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6288.677s">You</a> probably remember, Mr. President, that the angst that was out in the community when this was given to an outside entity <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6296.755s">and</a> allowed them to come in, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6299.337s">There</a> was a lot of angst in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6301.478s">There</a> was a lot of unknowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6303.86s">We</a> had to revamp the program a million times, Mr. President, to deal with resident permit parking, to deal with overnight parking, to deal with, you know, people that wanted to run into a store for five minutes, but had to feed the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6320.171s">And,</a> you know, they put meters in certain areas to try to resolve that, but not in every area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6326.636s">You</a> have to look at signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6328.157s">That's</a> a huge issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6330.699s">When</a> we looked at this years ago, one of the larger issues, believe it or not, was signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6336.663s">Because</a> our signage in the city is not consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6341.026s">Go</a> anywhere, it's not consistent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6343.989s">And</a> then mapping out the parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6346.931s">The</a> city's not gonna take that on and map out the 1,200 parking spots in the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6353.148s">They</a> don't have the capability of doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6355.35s">These</a> are the things that really should be underway now that actually should be happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6360.313s">These</a> are the things that we should be talking about, who's going to be mapping out the spots, are we going to meet and so we, you know, in the mayor point to the committee, they did yeoman's work, they came back with a great report, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6373.123s">But</a> is that the working document that we're working off to create this program? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6379.193s">I</a> had a member that served on that committee that came to me and said, geez, after all that service, I didn't even know they hired a parking enforcement director. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6387.818s">I</a> spent all that time putting all this together, all these hours, and no one had the common courtesy to say, hey, you're on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6393.98s">We</a> hired a parking enforcement director. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6397.061s">So</a> I think there's a lot of what ifs with this program, and the residents deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6401.743s">And</a> I thank my colleague, Councilor Falco, for bringing this up.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6524.429s">Councilor</a> Matz. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6525.43s">Just</a> a word of caution to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6528.499s">It</a> was probably the worst vote I ever took on this council in 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6533.523s">But</a> after making the recommendation, sitting on a committee, a parking enforcement committee, for two years, I was appointed by Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6540.589s">I</a> sat on it with Chief Sacco, Gwen Blackburn, Ron DeFranco, business owner in the community, and a number of residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6550.037s">We</a> spent two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6551.819s">We</a> presented the paper to the Mayor McGlynn at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6556.525s">And</a> I'll never forget the meeting we had, Mayor McGlynn came out and did everything opposite of our recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6565.246s">And</a> I remember to this day, Mr. President, and because I didn't want to look like I was anti, I went along with it after sitting after two years, Mr. President, saying that we should take the program in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6577.189s">Why</a> not take it in-house so we have control? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6580.149s">And</a> after this many years, I think what we found out was you lose control when you do an outside <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6585.97s">parking</a> agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6587.153s">And</a> I think we found that out the hard way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6589.297s">The</a> second thing, Mr. President, why not get the lion's share of the revenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6593.005s">80%</a> of the money was going out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6596.38s">It</a> made no sense when we can use it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6598.641s">We</a> talk about all the time that we'd like to have other revenue streams. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6602.041s">That</a> would have been a perfect revenue stream, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6605.082s">And</a> the recommendation after meeting with all these communities was to put double head meters, Mr. President, that had the technology to be able to call in if you're inside a restaurant and update the meter or use a credit card or so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6620.946s">And</a> it had all the latest technologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6623.926s">And</a> the mayor decided to use kiosk <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6626.567s">which</a> we were told over and over again, are typically used in parking lots and not on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6633.393s">And</a> we were told, secondly, they won't accept dollar bills because of the rain and the moisture. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6639.698s">They</a> mess up the machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6641.38s">And</a> we were told a lot of reasons not to use kiosks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6645.543s">So</a> I would just caution my colleagues, eventually when the administration comes out with their recommendations, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6651.592s">It'll</a> be you that gets blamed when things don't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6654.855s">So</a> don't just go along to get along. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6656.918s">And</a> that was my mistake, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6658.84s">And</a> I regret it till this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6660.201s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8190.453s">Mr.</a> President, I wanna thank my colleagues for their comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8194.196s">I</a> believe it was in January of this year that this council offered a council citation, recognizing for his over three decades of service to the citizens of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8210.367s">And</a> now we're recognizing him for his untimely passing, Mr. President, which is a true shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8218.683s">You</a> know, when you think about Officer Butts, you know, what comes to mind to me is community policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8227.649s">He</a> was like having a family member on the Method Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8233.158s">I've</a> never had a family member of the Medford Police Department, but Billy Butts was like having an older brother on the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8240.446s">He</a> cared about everyone that he came in contact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8244.691s">He</a> went the extra mile, Mr. President, to make sure that things were taken care of and that people didn't get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8253.16s">You</a> know, and when I say hurt, I mean physically hurt, but he was the type of guy that would try to iron out situations without having them escalate and grow, and he was good at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8264.028s">He</a> was really good at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8266.089s">And,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8267.94s">you</a> know, when you talk about community policing, he was the type of police officer that you'd imagine back in the 30s and 40s in the city that would go around to each door in the business district and shake it to see if they were locked after hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8284.444s">I</a> mean, he was truly that type of officer that, you know, really, I think you don't come by nowadays. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8291.885s">And</a> he had that special gift of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8295.306s">and</a> being able to communicate with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8297.588s">And</a> you always felt comfortable with Billy Butts. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8300.87s">He</a> always had a smile, although he looked kind of intimidating that, you know, if you did the wrong thing, it'd take care of you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8308.174s">But</a> he always had a smile on his face, a good word to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8313.838s">And,</a> you know, someone that passes before their time, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8319.1s">uh,</a> is an awful, awful tragedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8322.004s">And</a> truly, Billy Butts is a tragedy, Mr. President, because <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8327.415s">As</a> I said, in this day and age, you don't find police officers that have that skill of communication, the skill of community building, of community policing, old-fashioned policing, which I like to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8343.845s">When</a> an officer knew your name and you felt a tie with the police department, Mr. President, it wasn't just a car driving through the neighbor, but you knew it was Officer Butts, and he'd pull over and talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8357.443s">And</a> that was the type of officer he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8359.524s">And</a> honestly, as Council Scarpelli mentioned, he's a true friend and it's a great loss for this community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8529.226s">On</a> that note, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8530.727s">And</a> a little sprinkle of insanity too.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_IC6Elh6AwZY/2024-11-19_IC6Elh6AwZY.html">City Council 10-19-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=274.998s">So,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=277.759s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=278.519s">So</a> just if I could, Mr. President, a majority of this council last week voted for plan C, which was the most disruptive change to our polling places, added eight new precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=295.625s">Plan</a> A is the least disruptive and plan B was what I would consider a middle of the road adding <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=304.093s">award</a> nine to the Wellington area with some slight disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=309.539s">So</a> I just want the record to reflect that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=312.102s">So</a> we're going from the most disruptive, which a majority of this council voted for now to no change at all, more or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=319.27s">So</a> I just want the record to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=322.313s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=323.114s">Do</a> we have a motion on the floor?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1518.18s">The</a> chair recognizes Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1520.021s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and first I'd like to state that parking on a sidewalk is illegal in the community, it needs to be enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1529.884s">So</a> that's the first thing, parking on a sidewalk is illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1533.885s">Secondly,</a> Mr. President, I believe I was the one that offered the motion back before the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1540.207s">to</a> have the administration go out and take a look at the sidewalks and curbing and the condition of that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1549.69s">Not</a> to pass the buck, but all we can do is make recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1554.751s">So</a> even if we vote tonight to have your street repaved, every sidewalk fixed, all the curbing, it does not mean it's gonna take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1562.593s">It</a> has to be the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1565.054s">So</a> just so you know, that's what we're up against. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1567.496s">So</a> we can offer all the resolutions we want, but ultimately the day-to-day operations of the city and where the streets get done is up to the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1577.886s">So</a> the fact that you said that you see all these streets getting done and so forth, that is not this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1585.813s">That's</a> the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1586.894s">Excuse</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1591.738s">The</a> city administration know the council is the only open forum but you know I would highly recommend that residents reach out to the city administration and let them know the concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1601.787s">I'm</a> sure we'll all reiterate it tonight here, but I just want people to be aware that the buy in has to be from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1610.692s">It</a> was this council that offered the ordinance was actually my ordinance that reduce the speed in the city from 30 to 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1618.697s">And</a> that was done through city ordinance, which we have control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1622.359s">So</a> the council did take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1624.253s">when</a> we heard about the speeding throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1627.836s">This</a> council did take action on a number of issues, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1631.779s">being</a> not speed bumps, but raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1636.563s">They're</a> more effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1637.984s">And</a> we started a pilot program back some years ago, and we did one on Winthrop Street, close to Boston Ave, and there was supposed to be a number of other raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1647.912s">This</a> would be an ideal place for- <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1651.235s">for</a> a raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1653.076s">However,</a> the city has failed to act on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1657.158s">So</a> it wasn't this council, the council made recommendations, the city has failed to offer these traffic calming approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1663.821s">So</a> this council, in my opinion, has been very proactive, talking about curbing, widening sidewalks to reduce speed, lowering the speed limit, which we did, and tried to get ahead of the cut through traffic and the speeding that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1679.516s">I</a> think we all agree that something in the area needs to take place and I'm sure my other council colleagues will make comment as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1686.619s">But</a> I just want the residents to know that if it was up to this council, it'd be done next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1691.881s">Unfortunately,</a> it's not up to this council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2053.465s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2054.766s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2056.287s">Mr.</a> President, we also just got a correspondence from the mayor stating that the safe routes to schools at the Brooks was recently completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2065.492s">And</a> I would challenge that, Mr. President, because I don't think creating one route to a school, which there was some improvements made along High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2075.378s">without</a> a doubt, some great improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2078.019s">But</a> clearly, when you look in the neighborhood, I grew up off Irving Street, so I'm very familiar with the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2084.323s">And</a> I can tell you firsthand, Mr. President, many of those roads have been neglected for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2090.646s">And</a> I think what you're seeing right now is a culmination of many years of neglect. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2097.589s">And</a> by no means would you consider this safe routes to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2101.291s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2306.911s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2308.132s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2310.193s">Councilor</a> Bears is correct, but the city does have linkage funding that we can use for infrastructure improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2317.619s">The</a> city does have water and sewer enterprise account money, well over $6 million in surplus money that can be used for drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2326.965s">That's</a> what the money's there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2328.126s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2329.167s">And</a> so there is money available to attend to these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2333.77s">It's</a> the fact that there's no plan currently in the community to address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2339.475s">So</a> if residents can look and say, here's the list of projects that are on the list and your project is scheduled for this, this and this, then they'd have some type of idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2347.941s">But</a> as we heard already from residents that are going to see click fix or reporting it to the city administration, they don't even get a call back. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2356.448s">So</a> I think part of the disconnect is that there's nowhere to go to find where you are if you are on a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2362.872s">And</a> secondly, what may be available because there is funding available. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2367.975s">We</a> just got, I think it was Councilor Falco mentioned about the $48 million in the different uses that we're getting from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2375.48s">And</a> one is for road and infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2379.362s">$48</a> million, and there's no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2382.064s">You</a> know, Councilor Falco could talk about it better than I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2386.026s">There's</a> currently no plan, but this is the money that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2389.168s">The</a> 6 million in water and sewer enterprise account is your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2393.39s">It's</a> an over-assessment for water and sewer, not to address sidewalks, but infrastructure, because the sidewalks is probably the cheapest thing, doing the drainage and so forth is the most expensive, but we have money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2406.317s">So</a> some of it is a disconnect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2409.3s">So</a> I don't want residents to believe that we're never going to be able to get through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2413.364s">There's</a> money available. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2414.725s">It's</a> a matter of having a plan and working methodically through the plan.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3203.747s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3204.447s">I</a> wanna thank President Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3208.51s">And</a> as you mentioned, Mr. President, this was brought up over a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3213.579s">And</a> we have yet to receive any type of response from the city administration or any action regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3220.305s">This</a> is a very important public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3223.648s">It</a> may not seem so, but these construction companies, these utility companies are coming into this community and they're running roughshod across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3235.058s">They</a> really are. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3235.999s">They're</a> working at their own pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3238.921s">They're</a> putting their equipment wherever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3241.403s">and</a> to the neglect of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3245.266s">And</a> there's no oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3246.907s">There's</a> no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3248.167s">And</a> that's a concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3249.908s">And</a> because of all the construction, it's happening everywhere in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3254.291s">So</a> I would hope that the city administration act pretty quickly on these public safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3259.614s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=500.202s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=503.263s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=504.724s">And,</a> um, just for a little bit of, uh, background on this, I actually sat on the council when there was a pushback some 16, 17 years ago, uh, to consolidate the number of billboards that existed throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=524.427s">and</a> many of which abutted neighborhoods, uh, as we all are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=529.551s">And</a> the push back then was to kind of centrally focus, uh, the billboards along 93 and take them out of the neighborhood areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=540.699s">And</a> I believe the agreement that was passed some years ago was very successful in taking out some of that blight in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=548.883s">And</a> at the time, residents were very happy with the agreement that was struck by then Mayor McGlynn and some of the big billboard advertising companies at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=563.609s">Ron</a> Roberto has been in this community for a hundred years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=568.955s">I</a> know you're not that old, Ron, but he's been an establishment in this community for 100 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=574.957s">He's</a> been a tremendous business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=578.018s">He's</a> been a tremendous advocate for social service programs in our community and someone that I look up to, Mr. President, as a business leader in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=591.942s">So</a> I just want that to be known, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=594.303s">The</a> question I had to Mr. Yano, he mentioned the $25,000 in linkage and seven hours of public service messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=603.45s">I</a> was just wondering, does that differ from the current agreement that is in place now?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=617.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=618.013s">So,</a> so, uh, can you state what the original agreement is and when does that, was that a 20 year agreement? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=624.197s">And</a> when does that end?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=652.944s">So</a> that expires in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=654.385s">So</a> when you talk about the $25,000 linkage, is it just for this sign or is it for other signs included?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=667.316s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=669.658s">So</a> the seven hours of public service is in addition to hours that are being done right now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=681.543s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=682.164s">Are</a> you able to tell us how many public service hours have been messaged on that board since its inception?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=720.523s">Mr.</a> Clerk, Mr. President, as part of this report, I would ask that we receive an update on the public service messages that are going out by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=730.947s">I</a> want to make sure if they're allotting, it's a very expensive endeavor if anyone ever put something up on a billboard, and I want to make sure that we're using it to benefit our local civic groups as well as our sports teams and any other messaging, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=747.132s">So</a> I want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=750.213s">I</a> have, as my colleague stated, I have no problem upgrading to a digital board. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=755.296s">You</a> know, that's the wave of technology, and it's the latest and greatest. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=761.279s">The</a> illuminants are less than what's out there now, so that's always been a concern with the Butters and neighborhood, and the fact that it's gonna be shut off after, did you say 11, Mr. Yano? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=776.406s">Yeah,</a> they go dark from 11 to 5 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=779.763s">11</a> to 5 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=780.784s">The</a> city does not pay for a nickel of the electricity that's paid by the property owner, and we get $25,000 in linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=788.826s">So</a> to me, this is a win-win, Mr. President, and I will support it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=792.548s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=792.988s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1121.212s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1122.233s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1124.013s">This</a> has been a long arduous process over the last year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1132.295s">Countless</a> meetings, hundreds of hours, Mr. President, meetings, the hiring of a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1139.797s">And</a> I believe what we have now is a good working document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1144.923s">One</a> in which requires additional stakeholder input. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1149.567s">Um,</a> and that is going to take place over a period of time with the offices of the community development board, as well as what this method city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1158.193s">So</a> there's much room for discussion and change. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1161.796s">This</a> was a starter document that we put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1165.659s">Uh,</a> it hasn't been looked at in probably 30 something years, the zoning in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1170.923s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1171.483s">It</a> was long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1172.844s">The</a> one request I would have, Mr. President, and I've had a number of residents reach out to me asking me to summarize the major changes, um, in this particular document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1184.072s">And</a> I know we have a red line, the blue line copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1187.935s">And,</a> uh, unless you've been working with this document, uh, for the past year and a half, um, to me, it's zoning is pretty complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1196.701s">I</a> think it's one of the most complex issues that I've had to deal with at my tenure on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1202.064s">And</a> at this point, I would ask that if we go back to our consultant and see if he can put together a brief summary of the major changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1215.089s">There</a> was a lot of technical changes, and I don't think at this point the technical changes we have to summarize, but the major changes <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1223.983s">uh,</a> that, uh, you know, and I, and I guess that's open for interpretation, but the major changes to this, Mr. President, if he could put together just a brief summary, so residents can look at it rather than going through a hundred page document, uh, look at it and say, okay, this is impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1240.528s">That's</a> impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1241.588s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1242.068s">I</a> don't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1243.009s">I</a> should research this further. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1244.549s">I</a> don't need to research it further. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1246.57s">Um,</a> and at least, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1247.97s">uh,</a> give them a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1250.972s">Uh,</a> you know, we've all sat through hundreds of hours meetings, uh, and most residents haven't had that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1257.876s">Uh,</a> no, what I say, they should, uh, you know, uh, have been that involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1262.86s">That's</a> why they elect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1263.88s">But,</a> uh, it's important that, uh, they have a thumbnail cursory of what transpired <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1270.344s">through</a> this work of this council over the last year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1273.307s">So</a> I would respectfully ask that be part of Council Vice President Knight's paper to move this forward to the community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1282.073s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1282.913s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2077.739s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2078.56s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2083.283s">I</a> can date this back to probably at least five or six years ago in the Dexter Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2090.367s">We</a> were getting a number of complaints back then for rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2094.549s">The</a> problem has shifted up to the heights around Carr Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2099.572s">to</a> Wellington and the Haines Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2102.935s">I'm</a> getting a ton of complaints, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2105.537s">Just</a> tonight, coming to the meeting, you know how it gets dark early, I put my car lights on in the driveway, and a good-sized rat walked by the garage door. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2115.971s">um,</a> and Wellington that was in my own driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2118.714s">Um,</a> you know, this is becoming a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2122.739s">And</a> in my discussions with the city recently, as of within the last week, because I've been asking about the baiting as councilor Falco mentioned, I was told by a city employee, they no longer bait <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2135.713s">the</a> catch basins in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2138.315s">They</a> do not use that as a process for controlling pest control in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2144.761s">I'm</a> not sure what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2146.863s">I</a> can tell you firsthand, when you call and say there's a problem with rats, the city comes out and they give you a leaflet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2155.138s">And</a> they leaflet all the doors in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2157.739s">And</a> they'll tell you, don't leave food out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2159.3s">Don't</a> put your barrels out too early. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2161.12s">Don't</a> leave a water source. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2162.461s">If</a> you're giving the birds water or squirrels, don't leave that out because rats are going to look for the water source. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2170.644s">You</a> know, if you're growing vegetables outside, make sure you have them contained and not a food source. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2176.747s">There's</a> a lot of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2179.968s">things</a> residents can do, Mr. President, but I don't believe the city has acted enough on behalf of its residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2187.331s">And</a> I've stated this in the past, and I need to be critical, Mr. President, because yes, this is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2192.933s">I</a> read an article recently in the Town Online that said how it's a not sure problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2199.355s">But</a> yes, it's a problem in other communities, but we're not doing enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2203.897s">And</a> I brought this up during budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2205.958s">I</a> believe, and I don't have the number in front of me, it was in between $10,000 to $15,000 that we spend citywide for pest control. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2216.302s">Anyone</a> that's called someone to do pest control, they'll come out your house, it's $300, $400 a whack to do an extermination around one home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2224.566s">Here</a> we have seven square miles with 15,000 homes, and we're spending $10,000 to $15,000 on pest control, and we have a rat problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2235.952s">It</a> just doesn't make sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2238.913s">And</a> I don't believe the city's taking it seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2241.574s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2245.195s">We</a> need to call for a meeting, Mr. President, pretty quickly to find out what the Board of Health's doing regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2252.318s">We're</a> bringing in as contractors, because clearly we don't have the bandwidth or the capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2258.9s">to</a> handle it internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2260.481s">And</a> secondly, Mr. President, as I stated before, and I'm not sure if the city's working on it or not, this council voted unanimously, uh, as part of, uh, the, uh, ordinance that we put together was to, uh, allow for a document that residents can sign that would release the city of Medford from any liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2279.936s">If</a> the city of Medford saw that they had, uh, you know, rat colonies on their property, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2285.92s">and</a> the resident was unable to afford it, or it was a non-owner occupied residency, that they could sign a form and have the city come in, because this is a public health crisis, no different than COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2302.096s">If</a> there's a large nest of one property, that affects everyone on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2306.941s">And</a> I believe it's the responsibility of the community as well as the city to step in, Mr. President, where need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2314.843s">And</a> we're at that point right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2316.624s">So</a> I would ask if the as an amendment to if the city administration has created that waiver form, I believe last I heard from the Board of Health, they were working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2328.007s">But</a> if they create a waiver form that would allow residents to free the city from liability and assist residents in the containment and the control of pests in this community, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2343.395s">rats,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2344.376s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2345.637s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2777.842s">Questions</a> from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2778.422s">Gale?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2779.523s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2780.584s">Council</a> Box? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2782.225s">Thanks</a> again, Senator. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2783.747s">I</a> appreciate all your time and effort on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2786.929s">So,</a> with Plan A, will we be able to address some of the concerns that were raised by this council regarding someone that may live up the heights and have to go down to the Roberts School to vote and not the Firefighters Club? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2802.801s">Will</a> we be able to address some of those issues within Plan A?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2806.184s">We</a> won't?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2847.493s">Plan</a> A is really no change at all, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2857.255s">Right,</a> right, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2858.495s">I</a> just want to make sure we're all on the same page, that's the way I understand it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2862.936s">So</a> plan A wouldn't address some of the concerns that this council has had. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2866.776s">I</a> know Councilor Falco mentioned it and I mentioned it at the last meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2871.268s">with</a> addressing some of the concerns of residents saying, why can't I vote at this precinct across the street from my house and I have to drive three miles? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2880.392s">So,</a> we can't address it with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2882.614s">Potentially,</a> we could address that with a plan B that creates the additional ward in the Wellington area and shift areas based on that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3487.346s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague for offering this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3493.611s">I</a> see this a little differently, Mr. President, and I'm not opposed to tax deferments in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3502.238s">I</a> think they could help some, but as what you heard tonight, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3507.603s">There's</a> less than a handful of people that actually choose to defer their taxes that are eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3516.471s">My</a> issue, Mr. President, is not deferring taxes, but keeping taxes affordable in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3524.822s">And</a> I think that's been a long, ongoing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3528.483s">And</a> the more residents I bump into, in particular, seniors on fixed incomes, Mr. President, they're concerned about the raising of taxes and the talk that's been out there in the community about potential Proposition 2.5 overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3545.49s">And</a> that scares a lot of seniors on fixed incomes, a lot of families that are struggling right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3552.957s">And</a> I think those are the conversations we should be having to assist the masses regarding taxes and allowing people to stay in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3563.287s">You</a> know, we hear all the buzzwords about affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3567.237s">But</a> when you keep on raising taxes and people can no longer live in the community, how affordable is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3574.545s">And</a> we can have all the discussions we want around deferments, but a deferment is a 5% tax on the tax that you're not paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3584.596s">So,</a> and that adds up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3586.978s">And</a> as we raise taxes every year, and God forbid there's a two and a half override, that 5% grows because of the additional tax burden that we're placing every year on residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3599.106s">So</a> I think if we're going to get serious about looking at this, the issue is not to look at deferments, even if we raise the limits, you know, and another half a dozen people took advantage, you know, that doesn't reach the masses in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3614.337s">It</a> doesn't reach the seniors that are struggling, Mr. President, not just with their tax bill, with their cable bill, Mr. President, with the cost of gas, with the cost of electricity, with the cost of oil, with everything going up simultaneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3629.663s">That's</a> what's hurting people right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3631.964s">So</a> I'd rather have the discussions on how are we going to keep our tax rate low? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3637.947s">How</a> are we going to look at other revenue sources? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3641.46s">Are</a> we talking about looking at generating other revenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3645.342s">As</a> our commercial property base shrinks, and it is, Mr. President, it's no secret, as it shrinks and they double the tax rate of residential, we are going to be shifting the burden, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but eventually to the residential taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3664.592s">So</a> they're going to pay a higher tax rate because of the shrinking commercial base in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3670.733s">These</a> are the discussions that the office of community development had, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3685.136s">So,</a> you know, I want to just make sure that we're sending the right message. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3691.05s">And</a> maybe this council should be sending a message that we want to entertain a proposition two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3697.673s">And</a> that would allow a lot of people in this community to rest assure that whatever is done is according to the state statute, which is below two and a half, Mr. President, even that to many seniors is a tough pill to swallow. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3715.895s">It's</a> between getting your medicine or paying your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3719.378s">Or</a> eating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3720.119s">Or</a> eating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3721.26s">And</a> that's a bitter pill to swallow, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3724.504s">And</a> we have a lot of seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3725.685s">I've</a> stated over and over again, we, Benford has a large percentage of seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3731.35s">So</a> you may have bought your house 40 years ago for $130,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3734.774s">Now</a> it's worth $850,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3739.717s">But</a> you're property rich and money poor, Mr. President, because you're living on a pension from 1970 or 1960. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3746.364s">And</a> it's not keeping up with the rate of inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3752.79s">And</a> this is what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3753.931s">I</a> hear it over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3756.544s">How</a> can we assist? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3757.765s">And</a> I tell people, in city government, it's inherent that, you know, that we have cost of living raises, we have contractual obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3765.629s">There's</a> a lot going on, a lot of moving parts in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3769.531s">And</a> I try to explain some of the modest increases that have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3773.252s">And</a> this council, year after year, votes, Mr. President, to shift the burden to commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3779.356s">But</a> eventually, the commercial businesses are saying, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3782.82s">I'm</a> not going to do business in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3784.102s">They're</a> crazy now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3785.223s">Their</a> tax rate's ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3786.865s">I'll</a> just go the next town over, and we'll set up shop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3791.211s">And</a> that's what we're seeing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3793.485s">And</a> it's unfortunate, and the burden is going to be flipped to the residential taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3798.609s">Do</a> we need to do things in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3801.571s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3802.172s">The</a> projects that we need to work on that are outside the scope of a budget, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3807.656s">And</a> those are the things we have to look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3810.117s">And</a> there are other avenues to address those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3813.4s">It's</a> not just looking at a Prop 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3817.023s">You</a> can look at debt exclusion, which is a one-time fixed cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3821.786s">for</a> a particular project that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3824.027s">So</a> I'm not saying we should never move ahead on projects that we need to do in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3828.47s">What</a> I'm saying is we have to be mindful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3830.592s">If</a> we're going to talk about keeping people in their homes and making method affordable, you can't do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3836.936s">You</a> can't raise taxes to the limit and then look at two and a half overrides and say, I'm for affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3843.52s">You're</a> talking out of both sides of your mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3846.542s">And</a> those are the discussions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3849.579s">Not</a> an attempt, which I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3852.181s">I</a> was the one that lowered the age for senior property tax exemption from 70 to 65. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3856.764s">That</a> was my resolution back many years ago, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3861.447s">Because</a> the need was out there in the community, and it still exists out there in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3866.771s">And</a> I hate to see people displaced because they can't afford to pay a property tax, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3873.355s">And</a> to me, a deferral is not the answer, especially when you keep raising taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3878.138s">That</a> is not the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3879.813s">Does</a> it help some? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3880.914s">It</a> may help some. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3882.396s">According</a> to the numbers, it doesn't look like it helps many in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3886.361s">I</a> also want people to be aware, Mr. President, the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3891.447s">There</a> is an exemption for persons with low or moderate income, and they should contact the assessor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3899.296s">If</a> that's a burden to you, there's an exemption by state statute that allows you to be exempt from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3905.581s">And</a> people should be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3906.722s">You'd</a> be surprised how many people are not aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3909.524s">They</a> don't know what the exemptions are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3913.166s">So</a> that's another thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3915.008s">There's</a> the seniors over 70, disabled veterans in our community, which is a tax exemption, persons that are blind, Mr. President, and over 65 with low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3925.291s">There's</a> all sorts of criteria with those, but you can contact the assessor's office and they can walk you through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3933.273s">So</a> I think we have to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3934.773s">I'm</a> not going to be on the council come January, but these are the discussions that I hope to leave with my colleagues to be mindful that there is other people out in the community that aren't as, uh, uh, you know, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3951.81s">in</a> a better predicament, Mr. President, that are living day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3956.511s">You</a> may not see them, you may not hear from them, but they're out there and they're struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3962.392s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4318.766s">Councilor</a> Marksley. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4320.106s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4322.067s">I</a> guess it's easy to always try to throw money at a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4327.131s">and</a> not look at what currently exists and how you can work more efficiently, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4332.755s">And,</a> you know, it's easy to go back to the well unless you've paid a tax, unless you had to make a decision between your mortgage or your food or your medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4345.903s">So</a> it's easy to talk in theory unless you actually lived that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4350.626s">And</a> there's people in our community living it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4354.15s">So</a> my concern, Mr. President, is not looking at a tax deferment that currently may assist a half a dozen people, and then if we change it, it assists a dozen people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4367.344s">That's</a> being disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4369.527s">That's</a> saying, oh, look what we're doing to assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4373.207s">The</a> issue is, Mr. President, the tax burden on our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4377.471s">That's</a> the issue, not deferring someone's taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4381.035s">How</a> magnanimous is that, that we'll keep on raising your taxes, may even go up over two and a half, but we'll let you defer it at 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4387.922s">I</a> don't hear anyone talking about the 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4391.526s">That</a> gets brushed under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4393.428s">At</a> 5%, we'll let you defer your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4396.37s">So</a> Mrs. McGlynn on High Street, we know you can't afford it, but on top of that, we're gonna charge you an additional 5% and we're gonna raise your taxes even higher than they were last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4410.302s">That's</a> how great we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4411.423s">That's</a> how much we care about the people on fixed incomes and the seniors and the families that are struggling right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4418.725s">So</a> I believe that, and I've seen this budget grow over the years, Mr. President, and city services have not gotten any better with the increase in budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4429.529s">So</a> it is a matter of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4431.75s">And</a> my priority would be to set a standard, Mr. President, when we talk about city services, that would be a standard that's set, that's currently not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4441.253s">We</a> have the money to operate this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4443.854s">There's</a> plenty of money to operate this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4447.71s">We</a> just have to work smarter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4449.732s">We</a> got to be more efficient and we have to rely on those that have given to this community over the years and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4457.258s">We're</a> not going to force you out of the community now because we want to all of a sudden address everything under the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4464.423s">And</a> if it takes a two and a half override, no one wants to talk about two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4471.069s">They'll</a> come to the one yard line, but they won't push it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4474.151s">No</a> one wants to talk about a two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4477.745s">But</a> if you listen carefully, you'll hear two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4483.147s">You'll</a> hear the mumblings of a two and a half override, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4489.009s">And</a> I don't want to be there in a year from now telling residents, I told you so. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4494.731s">That</a> was the intent from the beginning, a two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4500.453s">And</a> there's all this talk about affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4504.782s">How</a> affordable is it when you have to move out of the city because you can't afford your taxes, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4563.883s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4565.984s">And</a> like I said from the beginning, I support this and I've supported this and any other tax deferment and tax exemption for the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4574.346s">So</a> I've been consistent on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4575.886s">What</a> I've been advocating against Mr. President is the steady increase of taxes over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4582.608s">And</a> then the recent dialogue and discussion in this community about a prop two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4589.17s">That's</a> what's getting me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4591.772s">That's</a> what's getting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4592.993s">And</a> that's going to hurt a lot of good, hardworking people, a lot of seniors in this community, a lot of families that are struggling to make ends meet, sending their kids to school and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4603.343s">And</a> unless you're in that predicament, Mr. President, unless you've paid a tax, unless you've had to make a decision between food or medication or whether you're going to stay in your home, you really don't understand the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4617.074s">And</a> giving a tax deferment is not the solve-all that's going to help a few limited people, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4624.197s">That's</a> what it boils down to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4625.338s">But</a> if the council wants to spin their wheels on that and not talk about the larger issues on how we're going to operate a city, Mr. President, with the current infrastructure that we have and the current taxes that we have, then it's going to keep on going on and on, and it's going to be a never-ending race to the top, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4644.927s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6169.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6169.881s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6170.962s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6171.823s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Falco and Vice President Knight for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6177.749s">I've</a> known Joe for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6179.73s">When</a> I first got on the council, Joe used to come to that podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6184.033s">And</a> let me tell you, you couldn't meet a man that was more animated when it came to issues impacting not only the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6191.238s">He</a> was a strong advocate, as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, for his union members. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6197.042s">But</a> he was also a very strong advocate for the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6201.505s">And</a> he'd be the first to stand up and make sure that we had the appropriate apparatus out there to make sure residents were safe, make sure that the firefighters had the latest and greatest equipment to make sure that residents were safe, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6215.853s">And</a> he truly spent his time advocating, not just on the local level, but on the state level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6222.68s">He</a> was a fixture at the state house advocating for laws and additional funding, anything that would assist firefighters in their job, Mr. President, therefore making residents safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6234.331s">So</a> he will be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6236.213s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6700.067s">President,</a> can we take up public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6702.188s">We</a> do have someone in the audience that would like to speak on Riverside Ave.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6709.553s">Under</a> suspension?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6711.274s">Okay,</a> this is right on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6712.955s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6713.575s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6886.329s">Yes,</a> we have our resident Nate Merritt, Mr. President, from Riverside Ave that would like to address the issue of national grids work taking place at the corner of Locust and Riverside Ave.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7320.943s">We</a> have an item on our emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7325.508s">This</a> was a level one leak that they were aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7329.772s">Remember</a> we had these discussions when they were talking about the MWRA project with National Grid?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7338.645s">This</a> was a level one leak and the chief made the determination not to do the work during the day, but he gave them approval to do it at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7345.913s">So</a> that's why there wasn't proper notification, but I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7349.257s">There</a> should be some type of notification.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7628.698s">Mr.</a> President, this is probably an ideal time because, Nate, you're probably aware there's going to be a major project done there relatively soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7640.382s">With</a> the MWRA and all that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7642.082s">A</a> major, major project that's already been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7644.363s">So</a> you're talking close to, I think, six, I think it was three to six months.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7652.509s">Well,</a> I don't know.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7659.71s">Well,</a> we asked them to hold off. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7661.191s">They</a> wanted to do it before Christmas, and we asked them to hold off. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7663.711s">But</a> it is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7665.291s">It's</a> a major infrastructure improvement that they're making. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7669.412s">And</a> that's when they told us about the level one gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7671.973s">But</a> I just want to say, Mr. President, when Nate reached out to me, I reached out to Dan Cameron immediately from National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7678.454s">And</a> he was very attentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7680.116s">He</a> addresses the issues immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7682.438s">It</a> may not have been the answer that we wanted, but he immediately responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7688.104s">And</a> I just want to thank Dan Kiff.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_BW-5g1WATfg/2024-11-19_BW-5g1WATfg.html">City Council 10-05-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=30.288s">Mr.</a> President, move suspension of the rules, Mr. President, to take paper 21-571. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=36.653s">And</a> after that, Mr. President, to take public participation out of order.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=104.383s">Mr.</a> President, if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=106.64s">There</a> is several petitions before us, all of similar subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=113.362s">I</a> would ask that we take them all together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=115.663s">You</a> read it once and we'll take them all together and allow the petitioners to come up and speak.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1734.957s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1736.238s">And</a> I would like to take this opportunity to thank the speakers, Mr. President, who took the time to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1748.763s">And</a> also, Mr. President, the time to relay the story of what they've been through over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1759.05s">That's</a> not an easy thing, Mr. President, especially in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1763.953s">And</a> this council has gone on record on a number of occasions denouncing different issues within this community and sending a message, even on issues we have no authority on. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1779.779s">sending</a> a message if we felt strongly enough, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1784.041s">And</a> I truly believe that this is one of those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1791.345s">My</a> opinion, Mr. President, when you have an anonymous site, as was stated by the speakers, you have a site that you can't refer to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1801.85s">There's</a> no contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1804.571s">All</a> it is, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1807.002s">is</a> a hate-filled site, a site used to bully, Mr. President, to defame, to slander, to maliciously misrepresent good people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1824.293s">And</a> I think everyone has to stand behind this and say, we're not going to tolerate it, whether it's this issue, Mr. President, or the issue we had last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1836.051s">We</a> had a petition that come before us, a Method resident, an artist that put up a banner that was approved and commissioned by the parks department to put up the banner and the banners were ripped down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1852.366s">And</a> every member of this council was outraged because the banner was taken down, Mr. President and ripped down, outraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1863.895s">And</a> I would hope that outrage, Mr. President, continues and carries on, because now we're not dealing with a bayonet. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1871.962s">We're</a> dealing with human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1874.304s">We're</a> dealing with lives, families, businesses of people in our community, long-respected people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1885.993s">So</a> I would hope that same outrage that I had last week <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1889.669s">continues</a> this week, Mr. President, because hate is hate no matter where it is, no matter who it happens to. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1898.354s">It's</a> hate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1900.416s">And</a> that can't be tolerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1909.041s">We</a> have a policy, Mr. President, about cyberbullying within our schools, here within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1917.715s">I</a> can't think of any better example of cyberbullying than the Method racist site. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1924.799s">That's</a> cyberbullying, and I'm glad it's being investigated by the Method police, as you stated, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1930.802s">I'm</a> glad it's being investigated on the state level as well, because that site immediately needs to be taken down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1940.106s">And</a> I have no problem, and I'd like to do it in the form of two motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1944.642s">because</a> I respect my colleagues for saying that maybe part of the original motion that was recommended by some of the public was not under our bailiwick and it involves the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1957.39s">And</a> I respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1958.771s">So</a> I would respectfully ask Mr. President that we break it into two forms of resolutions and motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1965.455s">The</a> first one being, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1967.262s">And</a> it's a little different wording than the petitioner offered, but I'm willing to look at that language as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1973.827s">But</a> I would like to offer Mr. President, the motion that be it resolved that the method city council denounce the anonymous hate filled website, racist of method for its defamation, slander, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1996.147s">malicious</a> misrepresentation, and abusive attack on the character, reputation, and good name of Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2011.877s">That</a> would be the first motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2014.598s">I</a> do have it written down, Mr. Clerk, and I will get it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2018.061s">Well,</a> let me just offer the second one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2020.182s">The</a> reason why I split it is because I believe everyone behind this reeling <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2026.488s">wants</a> to stamp out hatred and racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2029.55s">I</a> believe that, Mr. President, strongly, with all my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2034.333s">And</a> I believe that first motion does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2038.496s">Second</a> motion is be it resolved that the mayor's response to the police rally be taken down from the City of Methods website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2048.122s">That</a> would be the second one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2052.192s">and</a> members could decide on their own whether we want to just send a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2056.313s">And</a> again, it's up to the mayor if she wants to take that down, if we want to send a statement or not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2061.534s">But</a> that way, we divide both. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2063.715s">I</a> want to thank the speakers for coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2067.136s">You</a> know, when I ran for public office, Mr. President, I ran to fix sidewalks, lower taxes, help our seniors, affordable housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2080.6s">You</a> know, the basic city of Medford issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2085.263s">And</a> now we seem to be getting in to a lot of other issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2091.027s">And</a> so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2092.669s">I</a> change with the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2094.09s">I</a> move with the flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2096.972s">But</a> as I stated last week, let's get back to the business at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2101.215s">We</a> have a lot of important items on our table, Mr. President, that we need to move forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2107.105s">And</a> I think, unfortunately, we're spending a lot of time on issues, as my colleague stated, that really don't involve this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2117.569s">But</a> then again, we are the only sounding board in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2120.65s">Where</a> else do you go? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2122.551s">I</a> guess you can get your soapbox and go in front of Colleen's, but where else do you go in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2130.283s">This</a> has always been the people's forum, as former President Mayorkas would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2134.344s">This</a> was the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2136.345s">And</a> whether we like what's being said or not, public participation allows people to get up and air and vent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2145.647s">And</a> it's our obligation and duty to listen and, if be, react. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2151.529s">And</a> I think this is one of the moments where we have to react and denounce. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2155.67s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2156.65s">Go.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2172.819s">No,</a> it was on the agenda, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2175.42s">I</a> guess it was taken out of order, but it's on the agenda.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2590.194s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2593.039s">If</a> I could, no one behind this reel is going to vote to limit speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2597.581s">We're</a> voting to limit hate. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2599.983s">That's</a> what we're voting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2601.804s">This</a> is to limit hate. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2606.486s">That's</a> exactly what this is, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2629.436s">The</a> government should take down this private website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2632.017s">I</a> have the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2633.157s">My</a> motion... I have the floor, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2634.958s">My</a> motion... And your point of information is long over. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2639.421s">My</a> motion, Mr. President, was to denounce. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2642.282s">It</a> wasn't to limit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2644.263s">So</a> it was to denounce. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2645.644s">And</a> this council has denounced many things, particularly in the last year and a half, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2652.268s">And</a> we can go through the list, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2672.098s">I</a> didn't know I was serving with F. Lee Bailey now, but I guess I am, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2676.38s">Wow,</a> you know, it's nice to have our facts straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2678.661s">Yeah,</a> Mr. President, you know, I wish the outrage applied to both sides, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2684.283s">I</a> wish the outrage, you know, when someone's getting up there and stating how it hurt their family, and members of this body can't even look them in the eye and are fidgeting with papers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2695.347s">But</a> when it comes to taking <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2700.439s">When</a> it comes to taking a plastic banner down, the outrage was palpable. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2705.743s">That</a> plastic banner was palpable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2710.466s">And</a> I supported that, Mr. President, last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2713.929s">And</a> I supported that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2715.23s">But</a> I equally support, Mr. President, human beings that come up and say that this website has had a dramatic impact on their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2725.772s">whether</a> we can control it or not, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2728.873s">I</a> understand we can't control it, but we can send a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2732.554s">This</a> council sends plenty of messages, and that's what we've been doing for the past several years, and in particular for the past year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2740.057s">Regarding</a> social media, this is not a post between one person and another. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2745.218s">This</a> is a dedicated website to attack and harm people. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2751.118s">And</a> the list keeps growing. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2753.298s">So</a> when we say, when is it going to stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2755.479s">It's</a> never going to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2756.399s">You</a> know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2756.999s">Because</a> no one's standing up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2759.58s">That's</a> why it's never going to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2764.901s">This</a> website started well over a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2769.042s">This</a> is the first time that someone has come up to this podium asking about this website or asking that we denounce it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2777.063s">It's</a> been over one year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2780.042s">So</a> the people listed on this website haven't got out. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2783.123s">They</a> haven't been vigilantes. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2784.724s">They're</a> not taking the law into their own hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2786.985s">They</a> were waiting for the process to play out, for the investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2791.987s">And</a> from what I hear, we're towards the end of the investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2795.509s">So</a> what you see right now is residents standing up after one year, Mr. President, of being put through the stories that we heard, the businesses, the people, the families that were hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2807.074s">and</a> finally say, we've had enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2809.516s">And</a> I think they have every right to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2812.257s">And</a> as long as I'm on this council, you know, it's only for a couple more months, but as long as I'm on this council, this will be the people's forum to allow them to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2821.723s">This</a> will always be the people's forum, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2826.386s">And</a> I'm not going to shy away from the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2828.908s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2830.629s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2831.049s">Name</a> and address of the record, please.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3304.483s">I'd</a> be more than happy to read.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3307.765s">Uh,</a> the first motion is be resolved that the method city council denounce the anonymous hate filled website, racist of method for its defamation, slander, malicious misrepresentation, and abusive attack on the character reputation in good name of method residents.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3369.112s">Read</a> that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3369.952s">So</a> the way I understand it, be it resolved that the method city council denounced the anonymous hate filled website, racist method period.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3451.771s">Second</a> motion is be it resolved that the mayor's response to the police rally, uh, be taken down from the city web, uh, city of methods website.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3530.689s">A</a> link to be posted- President, I move that you waive the remainder of the reading and just give a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3536.231s">Do</a> we have somebody from National Grid on the call here?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3829.023s">Thank</a> you, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3830.324s">Councilor</a> Bates.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3863.539s">Mr.</a> Marino name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3866.999s">Just</a> press the button. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3868.66s">Is</a> the mic on? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3869.26s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4109.614s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4110.694s">Yes,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4111.475s">I</a> want to thank Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4112.975s">I</a> think this is a magnificent idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4114.696s">I</a> read an article on the Medford transcript that stated that Medford residents had their say in the redesign. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4123.538s">There</a> was a meeting at Carr Park, which they had some boards up, and that was great to notify residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4129.94s">I'm</a> not truly sure how much of a say in the redesign is going to happen during that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4136.482s">I</a> think the creation of an advisory committee really makes sure that the stakeholders are there during the negotiations and are there during the aspects of the design of the park, the use of the park, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4152.383s">what</a> they'd like to see, and I think it's vital that the advisory committee be accepted because, like we did with Lawrence Memorial Hospital, the creation of that advisory committee, which was comprised of area residents, was the eyes and ears of the project as it went along. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4172.025s">And</a> the questions that got brought up were usually brought up by the advisory committee members, alerting city officials or, uh, you know, government officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4181.092s">Uh,</a> so I think this is, I support this a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4183.755s">I'd</a> like to see this done on every project, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4187.498s">I</a> think there should be some type of policy where these advisory boards, uh, created automatically, uh, in order to safeguard the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4195.204s">So</a> I support this wholeheartedly.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4230.921s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4232.402s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4233.723s">I</a> think this is the first celebration of being 100 years young that I've had since I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4241.247s">Frank</a> Mills, for anyone that knows him, he was at a Veterans Memorial celebration at the cemetery just recently, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4250.252s">He's</a> up and about in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4251.712s">He's</a> been an active member of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4255.034s">Frank</a> Mills has been married 71 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4261.66s">And</a> I might add, to his sweetheart, 71 years, Lena Andrea Tola. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4271.24s">71</a> years marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4272.241s">That's</a> a lifetime, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4274.862s">And</a> it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4276.442s">He's</a> been in Method over 75 years of the 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4280.324s">So</a> when they talk about lifelong Method residents, Frank Mills is one of the best, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4287.406s">He</a> owned a grocery store on Riverside Ave many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4291.848s">And</a> from what I hear, he was the kindest person you'd want to bump into. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4296.773s">You</a> know, if you had a need, Frank Mills was there to assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4300.437s">And</a> that's just the way he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4301.438s">He</a> always operated his life that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4303.98s">He</a> coached St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4304.741s">Joseph's</a> CYO basketball and baseball teams, and they both won championships. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4312.2s">Um,</a> you know, and, uh, you know, back in his early days, uh, hazma Pontiac, you remember hazma Pontiac on mystic have, uh, mr. President, uh, Frank sold cars many, many, many years ago, uh, on mystic have, and, uh, he truly is a gentleman, mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4330.712s">He's</a> an outstanding citizen of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4333.434s">And</a> I would ask that we recognize him for being 100 years young. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4337.677s">And</a> we send them a citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4340.098s">recognizing</a> him, Mr. President, for that.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=408.8s">do</a> you recognize this Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=410.261s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=411.883s">And</a> I want to thank President Caraviello for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=415.285s">My</a> line of questioning is similar to what Councilor Morell just offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=420.35s">What</a> was the job specification on this if it called for granted curbing, which I believe it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=427.195s">And</a> according to the contractor, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=429.687s">They</a> weren't able to get granted curbing, then to me, you would put in a temporary maybe concrete curbing until you're able to get the granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=439.197s">One</a> does not take the place of the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=441.92s">We</a> were told recently that the structural integrity and in the building material, a similar nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=452.415s">concrete</a> and granite curbing are not similar in nature, and I'm not a building expert, but I don't think you need to be a building expert to figure that out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=462.582s">And</a> if it's gonna stay this way, which I hope it's not, Mr. President, what is the difference in the contractual price that went out for bid with this particular company? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=474.791s">And</a> did the city approve the changing of materials? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=479.818s">That's</a> key, because if you're a homeowner and they're going to do work on your home and decided to do you something of less of value and less equality, you would raise an issue right and say as a homeowner say, I didn't pay for that I paid for this, and the city should do the same as the President, and if it's a matter of waiting some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=497.708s">until</a> granite is available, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=501.011s">But</a> the job needs to be done right. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=502.752s">As</a> Councilor Falco mentioned, at the McGlynn Andrews School, we've had countless concerns regarding crumbling concrete curbing around that whole infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=514.402s">And</a> it's been a nightmare for public safety, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=517.564s">So</a> I would just pose that question as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=521.528s">If</a> the city did approve them to move forward and gave it the A-OK, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=526.031s">in</a> that we as a community wait till granite is available in order to have that installed in place of the concrete curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=534.836s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=893.719s">Someone</a> that has their hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=896.583s">Who</a> has their hand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=898.145s">Christopher</a> Leary.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1048.166s">Mr.</a> President, it's important to note too, for the edification of the viewing audience that the council's vote tonight is a recommendation to the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1059.133s">We</a> don't have the authority to stop a project in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1062.115s">However,</a> the city administration does, and this is a recommendation to the city administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1168.496s">Mr.</a> Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1169.457s">We</a> want to let the mayor know the importance of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1172.119s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1172.379s">Mr.</a> Clerk, the roll call vote has been called. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1175.482s">Will</a> the clerk please call the roll?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1209.781s">Motion</a> to revert, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1968.126s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1969.527s">And</a> I'll be brief because this resolution that's on tonight was a result of the resolution that was offered by this council unanimously last Tuesday that came under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1983.397s">And</a> the reason why we could not give it a formal vote, Mr. President, is the fact that it appeared on the agenda under suspension and the open meeting rules require that the <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1994.583s">item</a> that we vote on appear on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=1997.205s">So</a> we requested that it appear on tonight's agenda agenda so we could take a formal vote for reinstatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2004.291s">Um,</a> it's a little troubling to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2007.153s">It's</a> now 12 days since Mike Durham, a veterans officer, was walked out of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2017.341s">Um,</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2019.773s">According</a> to the letter that was written by the administration, there is no corrective action being taken against Mike Durham. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2032.58s">That</a> was part of the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2034.541s">So</a> the city is not putting Mike Durham on corrective action. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2038.463s">What</a> they did state to Mike Durham is that they will handpick a physician <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2047.27s">a</a> psychiatrist that Mike needs to go to to submit to a psychological exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2057.294s">That</a> was 12 days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2061.136s">If</a> anyone felt that there was need for Mike Durham to submit to a psychological exam, that should have been done immediately, immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2076.377s">The</a> urgency of a psychological exam should take place immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2082.378s">It's</a> 12 days now. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2084.379s">Mike</a> Durham went on his own to the VA hospital in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2090.12s">He</a> met with a nurse for 45 minutes and they conducted an evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2096.821s">He</a> met with a board registered psychiatrist for 45 minutes that came out with a multi-page document <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2106.897s">stating</a> that more or less, and I'm not gonna quote, because I don't have the report in front of me, that Mike was fit to go back to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2117.04s">No</a> underlying issues, he was fit to come back to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2121.201s">Here</a> we are 12 days later, that report was sent to the administration, and the administration still sticks by, they wanna have their own person evaluate Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2136.343s">To</a> me, Mr. President, I think we're getting into a very slippery slope when you have someone that's a whistleblower, that brought up potential fraud, potential wage theft that's going on in this community, and brought it to his superiors, which he should have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2159.858s">And</a> then to have this type of action taken against this employee <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2167.264s">to</a> me, is not acceptable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2174.106s">It</a> reeks of retaliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2177.746s">Leaving</a> someone out of work for almost two weeks now, not knowing when he's gonna get this call to go see this particular doctor is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2189.44s">In</a> particular, it's unacceptable when there's no corrective action against this particular employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2196.404s">The</a> employee has unblemished record in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2202.408s">Check</a> out his personnel file. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2205.49s">It</a> speaks volumes when you look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2208.792s">A</a> gentleman that's gone over and above the call of duty, not just in the city, but the call of duty to this nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2219.144s">So,</a> Mr. President, I am really troubled that this is going on for so long, that we can't get back to the business at hand of running and operating our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2231.974s">And</a> we're focusing on an issue, in my opinion, that we shouldn't be focusing on. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2236.437s">We</a> should be looking at the wage theft and potential fraud. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2240.32s">That's</a> what we should be looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2244.964s">As</a> I stated last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2247.756s">In</a> the federal government, a whistleblower gets congratulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2253.357s">They</a> get compensated in certain circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2256.998s">In</a> the city of Medford, they ask you to take a psychological exam and they kick you out of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2263.56s">And</a> they tell you, you can't go in a municipal building. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2269.841s">What</a> does he say when he has to go have a parent-teacher meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2275.316s">You</a> can't talk to other city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2278.998s">That</a> sounds like a corrective action to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2285.101s">Again,</a> I'm very disturbed about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2287.843s">I</a> would hope the city administration that talks about transparency all the time will be transparent and come up and discuss the issue with the other legislative body, the elected body in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2305.731s">and</a> put this behind us, and that is yet to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2311.832s">So</a> my vote tonight, Mr. President, will be the vote I took last week to respectfully ask the mayor, who's the only one that can reinstate Mike Durham in this community, to respectfully ask the mayor to reinstate Mike Durham. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2329.016s">And</a> let's not continue to play out personnel matters, as the mayor always refers to it, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2336.311s">I</a> can't discuss it, personnel matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2338.312s">Can't</a> discuss it, personnel matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2340.213s">Personnel</a> matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2341.113s">The</a> council can't meet in emergency meeting or executive session, that's a personnel matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2348.457s">However,</a> these personnel matters are finding their way into social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2356.481s">I</a> don't know how they're getting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2358.662s">Some</a> even say confidential at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2366.584s">The</a> private investigator, Mr. President, that was hired by this administration, hand selected, is not so independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2378.431s">The</a> private investigator that was hired, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2382.553s">And</a> the record should reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2384.354s">And</a> it was stated here before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2386.855s">If</a> need be, we can pull the tapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2389.297s">It</a> was handpicked by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2392.859s">So</a> from now on, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2395.563s">If</a> you can handpick the judge you go before or the investigator that's investigating you, that's a society I don't want to live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2407.173s">It's</a> a report I don't put any trust or confidence or faith in, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2412.497s">This</a> council asked, right, if we could hire our own investigator to look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2419.242s">It</a> takes it off the mayor's table so it doesn't look like the fix is in. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2425.182s">The</a> mayor would not fund that, refused to give us one red nickel, Mr. President, to hire our own investigator. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2435.733s">We</a> all know it came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2437.115s">The</a> report came back, and the report found that there was no wrongdoing here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2443.956s">I</a> would have had more respect if they said, you know what, we did find a little something and maybe this could improve or that could improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2450.761s">Nothing</a> at all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2453.223s">And</a> it sends a message to everyone else in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2456.885s">If</a> you know something's going wrong, don't stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2460.528s">Don't</a> be a whistleblower. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2462.589s">Don't</a> put your neck on the line like Mike Durham did because they'll go after you. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2467.053s">They'll</a> go after your family and they'll make sure they hurt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2471.155s">And</a> that's what's happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2472.596s">They're</a> hurting a good man and his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2479.82s">And</a> I want to thank this council for standing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2482.582s">I</a> also have to go on record, Mr. President, because Saturday, when we asked the administration to appear, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2491.223s">The</a> administration supposedly sent an email on the Friday to members of the council stating that they could not attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2500.445s">No</a> one from the administration was going to come to our planned meeting on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2507.306s">All</a> I can tell you, Mr. President, is as one member of the council, I did not receive that email. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2517.647s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2518.448s">I</a> did not receive that email from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2521.8s">I've</a> been using the same email in this community for 26 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2529.286s">And</a> the administration knows there's members of this council that opted not to use the city email and have been using their own email. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2537.613s">And</a> they know how to communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2539.154s">I</a> get lots of email. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2540.375s">I</a> got two today from the administration on my correct email. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2545.96s">But</a> Friday, I got it on a different email that I don't use, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2552.045s">And</a> it happened to go out that this letter that was sent was now leaked on social media, stating that the council lied on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2564.719s">The</a> council stated that they weren't notified that the administrations weren't showing up, that the administration wasn't showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2576.038s">And</a> indeed, Mr. President, we didn't receive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2578.76s">I</a> can say four members of the seven did not receive the email, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2584.044s">That</a> was not a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2585.545s">I</a> haven't lied in 26 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2587.286s">I'm</a> not gonna start now on my way out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2589.748s">I'm</a> not gonna start now. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2592.29s">We</a> did not receive that. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2593.751s">So</a> to play this out in the media and go back and forth is a complete disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2599.315s">And</a> I would hope that this administration comes to their senses, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2605.882s">and</a> resolves this issue before it goes any further. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2609.765s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2759.195s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank you for co-sponsoring this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2764.196s">Dr.</a> Edward Butler has been a staple in this community for four decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2771.438s">In</a> particular, Mr. President, serving as an internal medicine doctor and infectious disease doctor at Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2780.581s">Dr.</a> Butler served on the Method Board of Health for a number of years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2785.982s">and</a> was always available, according to the brave men and women of our police and fire department, to be available for the departments of police and fire for communicable diseases and exposure, Mr. President, which many in law enforcement and our fire department come in contact with on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2810.648s">Dr.</a> Butler was a professor of community health at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2815.089s">He</a> also served at many roles at LMH as the Director of Medical Affairs, Chief of Staff, Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs, and Chief Academic Officer of Hallmark Health Systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2830.195s">He</a> received a number of distinguished awards over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2836.097s">In</a> 2012, he won the Ken Kaplan MD Award of the Massachusetts Infectious Disease Society, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2843.44s">2001,</a> he won the Middlesex Medical Society Physician of the Year Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2848.604s">Dr.</a> Buck was named three times to Boston Magazine Best Doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2854.548s">He</a> was a recipient of the Hallmark Health Hero Award and was in a number of publications, which I won't mention them at all, but the New England Journal of Medicine and the American Society for Microbiology, to name a few, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2873.921s">Here's</a> a gentleman that when you met him, honestly, you would never know he was a physician. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2883.148s">He</a> was a down-to-earth person. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2886.451s">He</a> was one that cared about his community, cared about his patients, Mr. President, and he will sorely be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2896.968s">He</a> had a tremendous office in there that assisted him. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2901.471s">He</a> would be the first to tell you that he didn't do this alone for four decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2906.675s">His</a> team consisted of Maureen Hayes that was with him for 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2912.239s">I</a> think that says a lot when someone stays with you for 36 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2916.743s">I</a> think it speaks volumes on his character, how he treated his staff, how he treated his patients, and the type of man Dr. Butler is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2928.894s">Nancy</a> Mahoney, 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2932.037s">Charlene</a> Devaney and Julianne Bartolino, who was the medical assistant for a number of years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2941.384s">I</a> know they're having a retirement party for Dr. Butler tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2945.967s">I</a> want to make sure that we get a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2948.169s">I</a> know, Mr. President, I think you forwarded a resolution to thank Dr. Butler <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2953.032s">I</a> already have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2953.973s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2955.173s">For</a> all his years and commitment to the residents of this community, he did a great job in protecting us during the past two years of COVID, being an infectious disease doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2967.419s">He</a> was the resident expert in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2971.101s">And</a> many agencies, businesses look to Dr. Butler for his advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2976.404s">And</a> that included city departments, as I mentioned earlier, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2981.306s">Again,</a> I want to thank him and let him know and his staff that they will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2986.169s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3663.533s">What</a> information, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3665.034s">Just</a> so I understand, because when you say the artwork, you're saying they originally approved and went on a website and saw all your artwork and then approved the artwork as well as giving you approval to use the parks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3720.965s">I</a> just want to make sure we're talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3722.607s">You're</a> saying by the park board or some other entity?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3732.115s">They</a> can't approve to put something up in a public park. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3734.797s">That</a> has to be done by the Parks Commission.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3739.041s">I</a> just want to make sure we're on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3742.624s">So</a> you're saying the Park Commission was the one that approved
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3760.955s">So</a> you're saying that was all in a making sure it was yes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3783.494s">So</a> when was the actual vote, if you could, just, I know you just- May 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3788.418s">May</a> 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3788.918s">And</a> that encompassed the approval to be in the PACS and the approval- For this specific project.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3796.443s">So</a> that was May 2021.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3803.327s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3803.988s">I</a> think they meet, when do they meet? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3806.667s">First</a> Monday, okay, so we could find out.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3811.255s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4368.875s">no</a> matter where they came from, if they were born here, if they weren't born here, Mr. President, what information Council about when you mentioned community wide programming, how is this publicized? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4380.76s">How</a> is it advertised? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4382.54s">You</a> may be aware, you're the contractor, the park board may be aware, the mayor's office may be aware, but how is this advertised? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4389.603s">Because</a> you said the thing was, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4391.724s">partly</a> to bring up conversations and dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4395.486s">So</a> I'm just wondering, do these just appear in a park? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4399.989s">And</a> how are you going to gather dialogue and conversation when no one knows what's going on, something just apparently appears and people reacted? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4408.854s">I</a> mean, so, so I think part of it, we have to realize maybe, you know, some of the blame pie was how is this sent out to the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4417.099s">I</a> couldn't agree more. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4418.02s">To</a> notify, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4426.246s">So</a> why wasn't that part of this grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4428.287s">Why</a> wasn't this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4429.969s">Why</a> wasn't this part of the total picture? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4434.132s">And</a> I think what we see right now is you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4436.854s">There's</a> a lot of division in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4439.135s">And</a> to me, one way to head that off is to have open dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4444.299s">And,</a> you know, it would have been nice maybe to promote this like every other event. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4448.381s">Yeah,</a> I'm going to an event Oktoberfest and and the may has been promoting that up and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4453.243s">It</a> would have been nice to have some promotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4456.544s">You</a> know, maybe you would have got people out saying, Hey, geez, what is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4459.865s">What</a> does this stand for? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4461.066s">Why</a> is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4461.686s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4462.126s">Who</a> knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4463.046s">But</a> maybe we would have had that. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4464.327s">And</a> I don't think we allow that to take place.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4480.875s">I'm</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4482.056s">I</a> don't think you know what, how it was publicized and the way a trend, you know, transpired. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4488.439s">I</a> don't think was enough notification really to alert residents that first of all, there's something going on, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4495.542s">Love</a> to go down and check it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4496.582s">I</a> didn't know about it until I heard, you know, someone else saying it was ripped down. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4499.764s">I</a> would have loved to went by. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4501.024s">I'm</a> very active with the Methodist council. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4503.585s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4503.806s">So,</a> first of all, I would have loved to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4506.549s">And</a> I think, secondly, I think it would have head off, maybe some of this supposed intention or whatever existed, it would have headed it off so I just think that that's the way I would have handled it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4839.093s">We</a> don't know who tore him down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4841.875s">So</a> I'm not sure it's fair to say members of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4845.117s">So</a> I would just caution the speaker that we don't know who tore him down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4851.71s">I</a> just want to put that out there.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5060.219s">want</a> to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5060.819s">I</a> think you want to speak.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5233.572s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5236.013s">I</a> agree with that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5237.934s">Mr.</a> President, if I could, because when we're talking about division, I think that's an important topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5245.498s">And</a> I also think it's important, Mr. President, when we say create dialogue, it's not helpful when <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5252.663s">people</a> create anonymous websites listing the 10 most racist people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5259.111s">That's</a> not helpful either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5261.193s">So</a> I believe strongly that, you know, if we want to have dialogue and move together as one, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5268.782s">We</a> can't have this back and forth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5271.504s">And</a> I would hope the same attention to this website, Mr. President, that's currently still out there that names, I believe it's over 10 Method residents as the top racist in the city, some pretty prominent business owners and activists and people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5290.717s">I</a> think that equally needs to be brought up as well, Mr. President, because in my opinion, that is unacceptable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5297.581s">And</a> that deserves the very same nature, uh, Mr. President of attention, uh, by, uh, the, the authorities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5305.544s">And,</a> uh, I'm under the impression that is being looked at Mr. President, but I want to make sure we, you know, we put all the cards on the table and, and that to be is healthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5314.327s">That's</a> dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5315.368s">That's</a> discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5316.768s">And</a> it can't be one way discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5318.869s">It</a> has to be, uh, throughout the entire community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5808.602s">Mr.</a> President, I want to thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5812.204s">I</a> want to thank councilor beers for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5815.566s">Um,</a> you know, we, we voted a while back. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5818.708s">I</a> think it's been over a year now to declare racism, a public health crisis in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5823.755s">And</a> I must say, Mr. President, in this past year, I haven't heard from the diversity director at all regarding racism as a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5834.402s">I</a> haven't heard from our Human Rights Commission at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5837.784s">I</a> know they meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5838.705s">I</a> know they discuss these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5840.526s">They</a> haven't presented before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5842.367s">They</a> haven't raised any concerns to this council, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5846.99s">And</a> secondly, as Councilor Falco mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5850.532s">You</a> know, it was this council that stood up not too long ago when the mayor said, you know what, we're going to take our diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5859.678s">We're</a> going to make the diversity director, the human resource director as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5864.622s">So</a> you had a full-time diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5868.504s">Now</a> we're going to combine the positions for one person to take on both roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5873.047s">And</a> we're also going to ask that diversity director and human resource officer in the community, chief people officer, now, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5882.423s">to</a> also look at all the parking herring violations in the community and be the arbitrator of the parking violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5890.849s">This</a> person would have three jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5892.731s">And</a> then you wonder why, when Councilor Falco said, who's leading this? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5896.174s">Who's</a> leading the charge? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5897.675s">You</a> know who's leading it? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5899.056s">Nobody,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5901.854s">because</a> they're taking positions and they're watering them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5905.057s">And</a> that's why this council stood up and said the diversity director is far too important of a position to combine the roles and then give other ad hoc responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5916.166s">Because</a> we knew, the members of the council knew, if you did that, you'd water down the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5923.53s">And</a> it's far too important of an issue, Mr. President, to water down the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5928.631s">And</a> that's what's happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5930.291s">And</a> that's why we don't have any correspondence. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5932.872s">That's</a> why there's no follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5934.892s">Yeah,</a> the buck stops with the mayor, but there's also others in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5940.053s">A</a> commission on human rights, a diversity director, and others, Mr. President, that should be equally as involved pushing the envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5950.179s">You</a> know, we talk about having dialogue in the parks and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5953.64s">That's</a> what should be happening by the director of diversity, which I haven't heard from in over a year regarding any diversity issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5960.921s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5962.481s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5963.101s">I</a> haven't heard anything, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5965.222s">And</a> we haven't had any dialogue with the human rights commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5969.782s">And</a> I know they mean I've watched their meetings of what I know they're discussing these issues, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5975.603s">It's</a> in a vacuum and that's where it stays. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5980.083s">So</a> to have meaningful dialogue, it's great to have these roadmaps and so forth, and you have these round table discussions, and then after that, it kind of dies off, it peters off. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5994.515s">Let's</a> face it, after that, there's no centralized focus on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5999.741s">And</a> if we're going to get serious, that's what we need, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6002.943s">We</a> don't need to water down positions and make one person the chief of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6008.405s">And</a> meanwhile, nothing gets done because they're the chief of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6012.427s">And</a> that's what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6013.628s">It's</a> exactly what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6014.809s">And</a> I'm glad my college stood up and fought not to combine those positions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6020.731s">It</a> was a tough vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6022.759s">because</a> they were trying to sell it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6024.18s">Geez,</a> look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6025.94s">It's</a> excellent to have the head of diversity as the director of human resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6033.183s">It</a> may be a good idea, Mr. President, but we all knew one person that was far too big of a role for one person in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6041.146s">And</a> I'm glad we took the stance, to be quite frank with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6043.867s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6044.788s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6128.689s">One</a> person doing the job?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6137.671s">We've</a> been in a pandemic, things change. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6139.552s">So</a> that's a big difference, Jen, having it fully staffed and having one role combined, which we know is going to limit that person in that capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6147.537s">That</a> goes without saying.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6157.624s">Thanks</a> to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6158.504s">You're</a> absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6159.676s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, if I may get us back straight quick point of information.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7921.332s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7924.054s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7925.054s">And</a> I want to thank Cindy Watson for coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7928.036s">It's</a> been a long time resident of this community and <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7931.437s">an</a> advocate on a lot of issues, including Chevalier Auditorium, and I thank you for the friends of Chevalier and all you've done, your efforts, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7942.621s">Mr.</a> President, it was back probably now close to three years ago that I was approached by a number of artists in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7950.383s">They</a> knew back some <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7952.544s">10,</a> 12 years ago, I sat on the vision committee to make the Swan School an art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7961.648s">And</a> as you probably remember, Cindy, back then, it lost the vote of this council by one vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7967.49s">We</a> almost had an art center coupled with local public access at the Swan School. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7973.693s">And</a> that was very traumatic for many of the artists that put countless hours and time into that, making that building an art center, which we all know is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7982.256s">So</a> about three years ago, I was approached by some of the artists. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7985.018s">I</a> formed a group, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7986.818s">We</a> actually met on a rather monthly, every couple of months basis at Maple Park Condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7994.641s">It</a> was comprised of a number of artists in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7997.583s">We</a> did look at <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7999.784s">the</a> old Hegner Center as a potential art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8003.868s">We</a> had architects come in to look at the building and what the cost would be to refurbish that into an art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8010.054s">We</a> were talking about having public art classes at no cost for Medford residents, small art studios there, and have a full-fledged art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8019.203s">And</a> over the past three years, Mayor Burke was, I'd say, on board and committed to leaving that building open for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8029.348s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn was committed to leaving that building open to us over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8034.811s">We've</a> asked for it to be trimmed, which they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8038.093s">I</a> know personally, I dealt with Paul Moki. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8040.475s">We</a> had the roof showed up because it was raining inside the building, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8046.199s">And</a> we were concerned that we would get a building for the art center that was in such deplorable condition that it was going to be cost prohibitive for the artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8054.365s">So</a> we asked that the roof be showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8057.847s">And</a> over time, Mr. President, I think there's been countless resolutions by each member <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8061.85s">of</a> this council to make sure that that building is at least kept up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8066.955s">There</a> is a group that uses that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8069.737s">We've</a> all got calls regarding the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8075.422s">What</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8077.675s">the</a> middle six, that uses that building, the city allows them to use the building for training purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8086.343s">So</a> it's police officers from all these surrounding communities go in there and use that building for training services. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8093.45s">because</a> a number of residents in your building saw police going in there all the time and thought something was happening, but they're using it for training purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8101.177s">But</a> needless to say, to make this story short, because it's getting late, the group that I formed back some couple of years ago, we now have the possibility of another building in the community that may be rent-free, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8118.672s">more</a> parking, larger space, and a real suit for the art community for an art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8125.815s">And</a> that's been our focus for the last probably close to a year, and it's been taken away from the Hegner Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8133.339s">So</a> I would, it's fair to say that whatever's being done in that building right now is not involved with looking at a new art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8141.583s">for</a> the time being. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8143.084s">And</a> I would agree that that building something needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8147.506s">Mr.</a> President, we saved the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8149.927s">If</a> members of this council remember the mayor, Mayor Burke, try to sell that building off.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8157.611s">Yeah,</a> they were trying to get rid of that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8159.234s">Mr.</a> President, this council saved the building, the deeds at the registry deed stated if there was no longer being used for that purpose of providing social services for the impaired, Mr. President, that <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8172.994s">it</a> would revert back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8174.315s">It</a> was a little-known document. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8175.956s">The</a> building ended up being reverted back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8178.357s">It's</a> worth $600,000 or $700,000, I believe the assessed value is. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8182.7s">And</a> indeed, it's a building that we should take care of, even if we don't have plans for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8188.003s">As</a> Cindy stated, it's across, it's in a neighborhood, it's across from the condominiums over there that keep excellent care of their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8198.139s">in</a> their property values. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8199.879s">And</a> I would go along with Councilor Falco that we ask immediately that whatever roof repairs, temporary roof repairs need to be done and work around the building be done immediately in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8214.023s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8529.711s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8530.531s">I</a> want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8535.174s">In</a> all the years that I've had in this committee, Mr. President, you never heard anyone once say that all the elections are not fair, or the elections are this, or the elections are that. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8546.88s">General</a> Lasky, Judith Murray have run the elections in this community, along with the staff, Mr. President, in a way that gives us the trust and confidence that we're running elections, Mr. President, in the manner that they should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8561.086s">And</a> I just want to thank them both for their many, many years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8564.468s">It's</a> a thankless job, Mr. President, especially on election day, as the clerk can attest to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8572.091s">And</a> I want to thank them both for their many years of dedicated service.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8683.512s">Do</a> you want you to answer for him? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8691.495s">Press</a> stop.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1770.47s">First,</a> first funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1772.17s">Um</a> roughly and I don't want to put you on the spot but how many affordable <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1780.93s">in</a> the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1782.031s">Do</a> you have any idea?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1784.693s">Yours</a> and if you happen to know the city numbers, that would be great.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1803.53s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1804.37s">So,</a> how many is your organization?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1834.227s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1834.747s">And</a> where are those located, Susan?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1857.203s">Okay,</a> and where was the previous one? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1858.484s">I</a> didn't get that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1867.367s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1871.188s">And</a> does your organization look at property location when we establish affordable housing in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1878.629s">Are</a> we looking to make sure that every neighborhood gets affordable housing and they're not just centralized in certain areas?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1922.049s">So</a> that is a factor you look at locations to make sure they're dispersed throughout the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1933.057s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1933.557s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1934.157s">Appreciate</a> your work.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=2260.537s">Residents</a> here that would like to speak under public participation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3544.642s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3545.523s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for their comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3548.885s">I</a> want to thank Mrs. Durham. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3550.586s">I</a> know that was extremely difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3553.968s">And</a> from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for appearing before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3560.092s">Mr.</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3562.353s">When</a> Mike Durham was asked to leave the building, his last request when he was being escorted out by two police officers was that, I have a veteran coming in next Tuesday that faces homelessness. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3583.189s">And</a> in addition to that, maybe suicidal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3588.897s">And</a> I want to make sure, if I'm not in that office, that there's someone there that has the whereabouts and knowledge to address her concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3600.665s">And</a> I think that speaks volumes, Mr. President, about his character and about a man who is committed to his job over anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3611.512s">And</a> I think that's what leads us to where we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3617.41s">And</a> I always like to simplify things, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3619.491s">Because</a> you hear a lot going, who said what? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3622.133s">Who</a> said this? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3623.113s">Is</a> this politically motivated? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3625.335s">So</a> I like to simplify. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3627.296s">So</a> it's my understanding we had, and it could be anyone, we had a city employee who was a whistleblower say, I believe there's some wrongdoing going on at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3644.362s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3644.582s">An</a> employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3645.402s">If</a> you had a private business and someone stepped forward, you'd shake their hand and congratulate them and say, thank you for bringing this to my attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3656.684s">And</a> this particular employee, Mr. President, didn't just throw out accusations, but line them up with facts in which he sent to the administration and what she sent to this council time after time after time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3674.659s">And</a> to date, to date, I won't speak for my colleagues, I have yet to receive any information that this council has requested on this specific allegation, Mr. President, or the allegation that was mentioned by the city employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3694.024s">I've</a> yet to receive one iota of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3699.406s">Maybe</a> the city administration's still working on that, Mr. President, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3705.916s">But</a> to me, you don't vilify an employee who's standing up and saying there's a wrongdoing, there's a potential wage theft, whatever you want to refer to it as. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3719.18s">Immediately,</a> the administration should have looked into it and came out with a finding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3726.502s">And</a> we wouldn't still be discussing this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3730.404s">But</a> instead, the administration sought <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3737.138s">to</a> take a whistleblower, and the federal government, like I said, they praise whistleblowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3743.461s">They</a> compensate whistleblowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3748.204s">In</a> the city of Medford, they give you the perp walk outside, and they ask you to go for a psychological exam if you're a whistleblower. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3759.89s">That</a> can't continue to happen in this community, because it's sent, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3770.343s">It's</a> sending a lousy message, Mr. President, to other potential whistleblowers, other potential employees, other potential residents that want to come forward and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3785.315s">I</a> think there's something happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3787.677s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3788.257s">I'm</a> not going to say anything, because remember that poor Mike Durham, what they put him and his family through? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3795.163s">I'm</a> going to keep my mouth shut. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3797.955s">And</a> that's a lousy environment to work under. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3803.298s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, and I agree with my colleague, that really, we need to find out what's going on regarding the allegations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3812.664s">This</a> is one of several. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3814.685s">What's</a> going on with the allegations? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3816.246s">We</a> haven't received an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3818.188s">And</a> I would also ask, Mr. President, as my council colleagues both asked, that might be reinstated as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3833.055s">Because</a> as far as I'm concerned, if there's no employee action, which the letter I read stated that the city of Medford did not put Mike Durham on any type of corrective action, but they did tell Mike Durham, you're not allowed in any municipal buildings in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3850.966s">They</a> did tell him you can't talk to any city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3855.469s">So</a> I don't know how you put someone that's not on corrective action and tell them they're not allowed in a city building. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3862.627s">and</a> not allowed to go to a parent-teacher conference, which is a city building, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3870.992s">I</a> don't know how that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3873.553s">To</a> me, I'm not an attorney, but that doesn't sound right, where you exclude someone from a public building that's not on any type of corrective action, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3882.758s">So</a> those are my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3884.379s">I</a> hope we can get past this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3887.1s">I</a> hope we can retain a person of Mike's character, his integrity at City Hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3893.218s">because</a> that's the type of integrity and character we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3906.801s">That's</a> what we need, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3909.762s">And</a> tonight, I don't wanna be the bearer of bad news, but when items don't come on the agenda, so we have an agenda every night, or every Tuesday, so we have an agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3921.593s">And</a> if an item comes on under suspension, which means it's not on the agenda, typically the council, like we're doing now, we could talk about it, but we're not supposed to take a formal vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3933.323s">And</a> that's with any issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3934.424s">It</a> has nothing to do with Mike's issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3936.285s">That's</a> just open and transparent government. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3939.788s">So</a> we can't work on things that aren't on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3943.071s">And</a> people say, well, gee, I didn't see that on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3945.393s">How'd</a> the council vote on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3947.054s">So</a> we can offer that tonight and take the vote next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3950.557s">And,</a> uh, you know, but that's, that's how this council operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3953.898s">Um,</a> and it's always been our, uh, operation policy and procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3957.82s">So</a> I supported 110% of asking that, uh, we move it forward tonight and take the formal vote, which is required because it'll appear on the agenda next week for a formal vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3969.864s">Um,</a> and that's what I would recommend my colleagues doing this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3975.526s">Uh,</a> but I want to thank everyone for coming up tonight and supporting, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3979.967s">Mike</a> on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3981.748s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3989.01s">I</a> am. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3989.41s">I</a> am good, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3990.41s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3991.55s">Name</a> and address, please.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4073.649s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President, because when people come up to the council, they think the council has the final say. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4079.571s">So</a> I just want people, I'm all for open and transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4083.592s">When</a> the council votes, it's a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4087.233s">The</a> mayor does not have to follow this council's recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4091.114s">So</a> just so people know, even if there was an affirmative vote tonight, that doesn't mean Mike will be back tomorrow or the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4098.977s">It's</a> up to the city administration and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4101.618s">So</a> I- <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4104.405s">No,</a> I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4106.647s">I</a> don't want people to leave thinking once we, I don't want people to leave thinking one thing once we take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4113.912s">So</a> I like to be open and honest and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4116.994s">So</a> I just want to lay that out there that that's, you know, and the one thing I didn't state in the speech when Mike mentioned about this particular veteran is that he requested not only him, but through his attorney, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4130.582s">that</a> that office be staffed immediately in his absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4135.105s">And</a> that was a request of the attorney and also a request of Mike Durham. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4138.787s">So</a> whether the city administration falls up on that or has someone there, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4142.97s">There's</a> someone from the administration here tonight that may be able to respond to whether that office is staffed and is accepting concerns from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4153.836s">But</a> that may be a good question to ask at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4159.6s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4162.604s">Thank</a> you, Madam Chief of Staff.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4168.75s">Sorry,</a> can you just speak up a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4170.152s">I</a> can barely hear.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4181.643s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4185.331s">I'm</a> not sure what's confidential about whether a city office is manned or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4191.818s">I</a> don't know where confidentiality is that office going to be manned or not.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4515.035s">You</a> can bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4515.615s">You</a> can't bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4517.736s">That's</a> why we're talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4518.837s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4539.853s">If</a> I could, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4543.687s">I</a> think what you see is a support of council here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4546.769s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4547.289s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4547.809s">We're</a> taking it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4549.01s">We</a> want to follow with the rules, regulations and state lawyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4553.092s">So</a> we want to follow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4554.292s">We</a> took it up tonight under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4556.293s">It</a> wasn't on the agenda to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4558.394s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4559.014s">I</a> have no problem voting tonight to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4561.695s">I</a> have no problem voting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4563.556s">I've</a> done it in the past, but what I'm telling you is if this council voted seven zero stood on our heads and spit nickels in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4571.24s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4572.32s">That's</a> not to say 7-0 will do that, that this is going to happen tomorrow, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and even next week after we vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4582.811s">All</a> we can do is make an advisory opinion of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4587.255s">That's</a> all we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4589.057s">It</a> has zero teeth to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4591.578s">And</a> I don't mind doing it, but I'm just saying, I don't want people to leave here thinking, ha, the council just voted, we're all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4598.54s">That's</a> not how it works under our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4601.621s">I</a> just want to be clear with people.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4797.247s">We</a> have nothing to do with that, sir.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4799.608s">The</a> mayor, just so you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4800.769s">So</a> it's great to come up, but you should really know that this is not the body that's done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4805.01s">It's</a> the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4805.431s">That's</a> fine.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4809.052s">You'd</a> have to ask the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4811.693s">She</a> can't be on the Zoom call or nothing?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4838.614s">Well,</a> we're going to put this issue for next Tuesday, absolutely.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4843.915s">That's</a> not our issue, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4845.855s">That's</a> what we're trying to tell you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4850.036s">You'd</a> have to ask her, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4851.515s">We,</a> we can't demand the mayor to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4853.659s">I</a> don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4855.904s">We</a> can't demand she be here.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4859.791s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5141.863s">So</a> Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5145.54s">uh,</a> because, uh, from what I'm hearing tonight that, um, from the administration that it sounds like the office is not fully manned, uh, at this particular time, that sounds inadequate to me, Mr. President, and knowing the nature of that office and, uh, who they service in that office, um, I think it's only appropriate that, uh, we have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5168.893s">to</a> find out more about the function of that office, if it's going to be fully manned right now, Mr. President, and where our veterans are going to be serviced in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5181.067s">Because</a> this may carry out a lot longer than we anticipate. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5185.258s">And</a> I think at the very least, we have twofold. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5188.739s">We</a> want to get Mike back, but we also want to make sure our veterans are being serviced, Mr. President, in an appropriate manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5195.141s">So</a> I would also ask that we have an emergency meeting with the administration to discuss the operations of that office, Mr. President, and that it would include the payroll, which our veterans rely on, as well as any other concerns, Mr. President, that veterans may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5214.425s">and</a> approach that office with.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5228.254s">We'll</a> call for an emergency meeting on Friday.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5244.807s">The</a> council and I would ask for the administration, but any, anyone else have suggestions? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5250.272s">I'm</a> open to it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5254.836s">So,</a> uh, who we haven't at the meeting, the council, the city administration council, the mayor, maybe we'll want to bring in someone from the state, the veterans affairs office from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5268.632s">They</a> may be able to answer questions that we may have as council and I alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5274.794s">City</a> solicitor city solicitor sure.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5320.112s">Just</a> a point of information, Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5323.491s">Uh,</a> council council max, uh, an emergency meeting has the same requirements as setting up a regular meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5332.819s">We</a> need, we need, we need 48 hours for emergency meeting requires a 48 hour notice for an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5340.266s">Now</a> that I don't agree with just the messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5343.849s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5345.27s">So</a> that's a state requirement that we wait 48 hours when we're having an emergency.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5366.417s">That's,</a> that's my exact thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5369.158s">I</a> think we can meet an emergency at any given time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5373.26s">So</a> I would ask if we can set up an emergency meeting, uh, you know, we'd like to have all the parties there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5378.722s">So</a> tomorrow or Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5380.702s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5381.503s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5427.476s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5427.916s">So</a> just, just for the record, Mr. President, if we can state, uh, the emergency is, uh, that the fact that that office, in my opinion, uh, is not properly manned and creates an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5439.521s">Secondly,</a> that we know from the director himself, that there was someone coming in this week that had some potential potential issues, um, that could rise to an emergency level. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5450.046s">And</a> that's just one of probably many, many that we're, we, that we don't know of Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5455.028s">So</a> in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5456.749s">That</a> definitely is an emergency.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6941.501s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6944.163s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Falco for putting this on the agenda, and I want to thank the neighbors for participating tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6953.429s">Mary</a> Ann, every time I see you, you're always there advocating on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6960.313s">And,</a> you know, it's not just for speeding, the Green Line extension, 5G, plane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6969.238s">You've</a> been a great advocate for this community, and I want to thank you for taking the time <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6973.42s">coming</a> up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6974.601s">One</a> speaker, Mr. President, Sophie, just mentioned, and I agree a thousand percent, to take some temporary quick steps in order to alleviate some of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6986.369s">Because</a> all too often when we request a traffic report or study, to be quite honest with you, they take forever, and then once you get them, they're never acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6997.316s">And</a> I think at least for now, to let the residents know that we're moving on something like we did up in North Method on Fulton Spring Road, Mr. President, I think basic things like were mentioned, the paintings and low-lying fruit on putting some stop signs, additional stop signs, as Mary Ann mentioned, and things that can be accomplished relatively quickly, I think would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7022.929s">So</a> I'm hoping when we meet on site, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7025.59s">that</a> the city move forward immediately on some of these temporary measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7029.613s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7407.22s">President,</a> I think Council and Vice President Knight hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7410.963s">A</a> true family man, a great guy, take the shirt off his back, you know, if someone needed it, and raised a heck of a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7418.668s">And</a> as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, he was probably one of the most active fathers that I've ever seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7425.152s">You</a> know, in addition to all his other roles, he was at every sporting event possible, rooting his children on, as well as the Method athletes, and he will be sorely missed.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7517.645s">That's</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7519.347s">Mr.</a> President, I want to thank both you and Councilor Falco for putting this on, but Larry was a true professional in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7526.836s">You</a> know, you can usually gauge a person by how much his colleagues loved him. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7532.602s">And</a> even though he was chief, and that's a difficult job, and you make decisions that may not be favorable to everyone, he was always well-respected, well-admired, Mr. President, and he ran a fire department that was second to none. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7547.658s">And</a> I always remember that about Chief Sands, and he will be solely missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7613.838s">Council</a> Vice President Knight for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7616.699s">I</a> didn't find out until after the fact, Mr. President, but I grew up on Stearns Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7622.702s">And</a> let me tell you, growing up there was such a tremendous place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7628.785s">Everyone</a> knew everyone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7631.187s">Everyone</a> was over everyone's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7633.308s">You</a> were treated like family from every home on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7637.37s">And</a> if you weren't doing the right thing, as you probably remember, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7640.451s">Steller</a> or Mrs. Insaldi or Mrs. Freitas or you name it, the D'Onofrios, they were out there and they'd let you know, the Amaris, they'd let you know what you were doing and what you were doing was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7652.178s">And</a> it was just a great place to grow up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7654.659s">And</a> Steller was a sweetheart of a woman and she was a protector of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7661.523s">And,</a> you know, she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7992.514s">That's</a> great.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7995.137s">Mr.</a> President, I think the reason why is, you know, when you talk about Dom and Mario, they're a staple in West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8001.081s">I</a> don't think you can mention West Medford Square without saying Amicis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8005.463s">And,</a> you know, they provide an excellent product to the residents of this community, and the residents support Amicis because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8012.047s">And</a> they're two good guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8013.548s">They're</a> homegrown guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8016.65s">And</a> I wish them well, and I wish them another 30 years, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8157.677s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8158.518s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8159.879s">I</a> better put a pillow so you can see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8162.38s">It's</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8175.83s">Mr.</a> President, I want to thank yourself, and I think it was just you, actually, that put this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8185.557s">Lieutenant</a> Rudolph and Captain Conway were truly professionals in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8191.922s">I've</a> never heard anyone utter a bad word about either gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8195.625s">They</a> served with distinction for many, many years, an unblemished record, as was stated, over 70 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8203.491s">And</a> to have an unblemished record <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8205.972s">in</a> such a position of importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8208.833s">And</a> in this community, I think, says a lot about the two gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8212.814s">And</a> I wish them well in their retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8214.374s">And</a> hopefully, Mr. President, from what I'm hearing, retirees will be allowed at some point to come back and do some light detail and so forth around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8224.917s">And</a> I would hope to see them back again, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8527.874s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8528.755s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Morell and Councilor Falco for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8532.819s">You</a> know, I can remember this when I first got on the council back in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8539.566s">That's</a> how far it stretches back just with me and the request because that's been <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8546.07s">inaccessible</a> for at least 20 years that I'm aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8549.893s">And</a> we've had, as you stated, officials down there, state delegation, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8555.418s">We've</a> had everyone down there, Mr. President, but very little action. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8559.762s">A</a> couple of years ago, there was some aesthetics done to the station itself, but <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8566.187s">very</a> minor improvements were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8568.989s">That</a> is a heavily traveled, I mean they come from all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8573.152s">Just</a> ask the residents of West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8575.034s">They</a> come from all over to use the commuter rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8577.956s">And</a> it's unacceptable, to be quite frank with you, to have a rail, as Councilor Morell mentioned, that not everyone can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8587.002s">especially</a> in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8588.764s">And</a> I'm hoping that through our diligence and our persistency, like we did with Salt Street and the intersection of Salt and Main, we finally got the state to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8599.272s">And</a> I'm hoping that happens with this issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8602.355s">And</a> I want to thank my colleagues for bringing it up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9159.201s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9162.895s">Although</a> Marsha's mobility may have decreased slightly, your wit, your ability to relay your point has not at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9175.101s">And</a> you were instrumental with the surgical center and the neighbors up there to make sure we got the best possible solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9184.685s">And</a> I remember your speeches. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9187.066s">They</a> were winded, but they were excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9190.127s">They</a> were excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9191.97s">And</a> I just want to thank you for coming up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9194.117s">We</a> really do.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9524.012s">So,</a> Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Morell for offering this <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9531.31s">You</a> know, I've been critical over the last number of years regarding the inaction by DCR, the fact that we have so many state roads in this community, roads in which taxpayers reside on, pay the same tax that any other resident pays, but doesn't get the city services because they're on, quote, a DCR state road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9557.307s">And</a> as far as I'm concerned, that's unacceptable and very difficult conversation to have with a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9564.496s">And</a> I believe as a community, and this is no reflection on anyone in particular, but we fall short of the mark regarding holding DCR and the state accountable for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9577.17s">And</a> in my opinion, we should be having these meetings, not just with the administration, but with DCI. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9585.415s">We</a> should have a standard meeting that we have, because there's enough on our agenda that deals with, I can give a laundry list of items that I'm still waiting responses on, never heard back, that we should have a standing meeting with DCI. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9602.505s">and</a> maybe under your leadership, Mr. President, and it doesn't need to include the administration, it could be us with DCR, but I think it's vital, Mr. President, in order to address our constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9614.156s">You</a> know, it's one thing to bring it up before the council, but then as Councilor Morell mentioned, the second step is action, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9621.163s">lip</a> service and then action. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9622.885s">I</a> mean, so I'm always waiting for the action part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9626.069s">And,</a> uh, it's, it's a few and far between. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9628.571s">Um,</a> I know many of the agencies are shorthanded, uh, and I understand that, but, um, the, there has to be better dialogue and communication, uh, so we can represent our constituency. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9642.631s">And</a> so I would ask that at some point, Mr. President, I will talk to the representatives about doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9647.872s">Maybe</a> if we can brainstorm it, you know, even if we had it once every, you know, quarterly, you know, you know, quarterly, every every 3 months to just sit down and go over what's outstanding, because that doesn't happen.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9662.776s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9662.996s">I'm</a> still waiting on other stuff from a year and a half ago that residents keep on emailing me saying what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9668.741s">And</a> you know, it's just, it's unfortunate because you know, it gives, it gives government, state, city, just gives it a bad name, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9678.028s">And</a> I think we're all here to get results. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9680.751s">So</a> I appreciate the fact that this was put on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9683.253s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10155.294s">for</a> putting this on, but the rapid flashing beacon lights that were put at the corner of Riverside and Bradbury, they were installed probably two months ago, no longer functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10166.744s">They're</a> solar lights and they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10169.707s">So</a> I would just ask if, if Councilor Bears wouldn't mind amending this, if the city could check into that, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10227.227s">Yes,</a> yes, yeah.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10285.077s">Mr.</a> President, just if we can also add, if Councilor Bears wouldn't mind, the painting of crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10291.438s">I've</a> been unsuccessful for the last probably year and a half trying to get crosswalks painted.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10579.45s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10579.851s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I've been following this silver line. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10583.894s">It's</a> been around for a couple of years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10585.916s">They've</a> been discussing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10587.857s">Um,</a> the larger concern I have now was a recent report that I read talking about a 700 million shortfall. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10595.964s">I</a> believe the number was over <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10597.565s">three-year</a> period, three or four-year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10599.266s">You</a> might be mistaken on the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10602.487s">But</a> I think as a community, we have to be proactive rather than to react once these cuts come down from the T, which you better believe is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10614.673s">And</a> I think some of the issues we have to look at, like I believe we were promised that they were going to restore the 325 at 326 and some of the other lines that were cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10626.079s">But</a> now with these additional cuts, I think we have to meet on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10631.421s">I</a> really do, to discuss any information that T can give us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10637.384s">And</a> it's few and far between, let me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10640.586s">The</a> MBTA does not share anything with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10643.848s">and</a> you only find out when all of a sudden the bus is no longer in service or whatever the transportation mode may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10652.254s">So</a> I appreciate Councilor Bears offering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10657.037s">I</a> think anything that we can do, you know, we have to take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10661.401s">And</a> if it's one or the other, then we have to take even a closer look, but I wouldn't throw anything away, any increased access I think we have to look at.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11293.51s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11295.511s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up, and we've all talked ad nauseum about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11303.733s">And,</a> you know, to me, how do we get this resolved? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11309.727s">Money</a> talks, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11310.867s">How</a> do we get this resolved? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11312.248s">Money</a> talks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11313.548s">So</a> why don't we talk about our assessment, our assessment to the MWRA, not the MWRA, MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11323.372s">That's</a> another story. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11324.352s">That's</a> another story. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11325.793s">The</a> MBTA, our assessment, our yearly assessment, why don't we withhold the portion based on the service reduction? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11335.256s">Can</a> we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11335.876s">I</a> think they'd take it out of our check right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11339.48s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11339.98s">Can</a> we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11340.781s">Can</a> we do that as a community, say, this is what we're paying every year for, service Wellington, these buses, this transportation, whatever it might be, and say, this was a cut, it was a 10% cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11354.637s">We're</a> not going to give you the $3 million every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11356.679s">We're</a> going to give you $2.7. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11359.56s">I'm</a> just throwing ideas out there because it seems like we go nowhere with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11364.461s">Honestly,</a> they have us over a barrel and they just decide unilaterally what they want to do to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11370.002s">So,</a> I'd like to ask the city solicitor, in the form of a motion, if we as a community can withhold assessments from the Cherry Sheet, from the city Cherry Sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11387.152s">So</a> can we withhold assessments?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11435.746s">You</a> know, I've been trying not to belabor this, and I know it's late. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11439.028s">I've</a> been trying to assess the MBTA that has millions, hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-exempt property in this community, and I've been trying to get them to pay a fair share, Mr. President, which has fallen on deaf ears for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11455.54s">Someday</a> when I'm governor, maybe it's gonna happen, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11794.624s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11798.908s">All</a> call the vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11813.376s">Can</a> you just repeat what the motion and amendments are?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11841.012s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11909.127s">Okay,</a> so on the motion, Mr. President, if I could, I thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11916.556s">I</a> raised this issue during the budget, Mr. President, when we spoke about the taking of the parking program in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11929.522s">And</a> I won't go through my entire statement, Mr. President, but I have some grave concerns that we're about a little over three months away from taking this program in-house, and I have yet to hear <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11944.361s">how</a> we are going to operate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11947.543s">We</a> have a budget that I believe was allocated of $250,000, which is not enough money to establish a full-fledged parking program that consists of META people, that consists of people that work in the office, that consists of people that empty the machines out, that fix the machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11971.416s">So,</a> and I'm not sure how this is going to happen, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11976.519s">And</a> I think, you know, people have big expectations come January 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11982.582s">And</a> honestly, can any of us say what this program is going to look like January 1? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11986.225s">Are</a> we going to be able to meet the current obligations? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11990.872s">So</a> the current streets that are resident permit parking, the hundreds of them around the community that people have grown accustomed to, to having enforcement on, will that happen January 1st? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12002.655s">Will</a> it be a smooth transition? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12004.595s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12005.715s">So</a> I can't tell people that it's going to be a smooth transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12009.076s">My</a> personal opinion right now, it's not going to be a very smooth transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12013.457s">We</a> don't have appropriate funding to run a full-fledged <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12017.698s">parking</a> program in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12019.459s">And</a> I think a lot of the enforcement's going to suffer, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12023.622s">And</a> I just want people to be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12025.743s">So,</a> you know, I've been on the record, even during budget a couple of months back, saying that I don't believe with the current funding and the current process set up, can anyone tell me what the process is? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12042.595s">Where's</a> the office gonna be? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12044.435s">Who's</a> gonna be doing the hearings? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12045.916s">How</a> many people they're gonna hire? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12049.516s">Are</a> we gonna include other streets in the resident permit parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12053.437s">Are</a> we gonna do citywide resident permit parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12055.997s">These</a> were all recommendations made by the committee that the mayor put forward, and they did yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12062.198s">I'm</a> not saying they did yeoman's work, but now the next phase was, how do you carry it out? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12068.92s">We're</a> not there yet, 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12072.156s">I</a> mean, is there a committee working on it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12073.837s">Is</a> anyone aware? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12076.457s">So</a> really, I mean, these conversations need to be had because, you know, people are going to start pointing the finger. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12082.919s">And</a> let me tell you, the finger is not going to be pointed at this Medford City Council because we've been raising the red flag for the last couple of months saying, I don't know how this program is going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12092.473s">We</a> haven't had any involvement in the establishment of this program other than hearing from the administration that they're taking it in-house, which I support 110% taking in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12103.501s">I</a> just want to know the bolts, the nuts and bolts of how it's going to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12108.264s">How</a> are we going to fund it? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12109.605s">What</a> do we anticipate the cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12111.367s">The</a> chief of staff, when he was here, Dave Rodriguez, when I asked him if they're going to run the program with 250,000, said that was just really a small starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12122.852s">So</a> are we taking a year to get the whole program up and running? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12127.653s">I</a> think residents have the right to know that, and especially enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12131.854s">You</a> know, we moved to creating an outside company to come in because there was a lack of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12138.355s">And</a> I remember the days where people would park in the square for 15 hours and go into town. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12144.876s">And</a> the business owners would say, I can't get anyone to come in my business. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12148.116s">There's</a> no parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12149.837s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12150.057s">You</a> remember that, Councilor, President Kavya? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12153.561s">You</a> know, so these are the issues I think I don't want to revisit them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12157.643s">And</a> it feels like we're going down that same path. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12160.103s">So</a> I'm really concerned and I appreciate Councilor Falco offering this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12165.145s">This</a> is a little unrelated, but it's a real concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12168.286s">It</a> should be a concern of everyone in this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12292.906s">I</a> thought it was 250, but I made you off. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12296.347s">It</a> was a 350. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12299.601s">It</a> wasn't much more than that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12555.591s">And</a> the top of Governor's Ave, the last street on the top of Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12558.732s">We</a> can go down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12559.592s">Which</a> street is that, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12560.692s">The</a> top of Governor's Ave to the left, the last street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12563.153s">It's</a> a dead end. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12566.274s">That's</a> a, let me tell you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12572.607s">sure</a> would be sure.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13009.186s">Oh,</a> Mr. President, I'm sorry, there's two names on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13011.028s">Two</a> names, Officer Bono. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13012.489s">That's</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13012.969s">I</a> don't know if anyone wants to talk on him, but Sergeant David Bono, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13019.194s">Another</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13019.674s">They</a> both came in roughly the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13022.336s">They</a> both have 36 years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13025.699s">I</a> won't be around in January, and that's why I'm offering it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13029.381s">He's</a> retiring January 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13031.763s">And</a> anyone knows Sergeant Bono, he's been involved in the patrolman's union for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13039.391s">He's</a> been involved in the superior officer union for years, a great officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13046.178s">Someone,</a> both these officers, Guy Leone and Dave Bono, unblemished records. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13052.765s">36</a> years, both each 36 years, and unblemished records. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13058.15s">They've</a> had a number of accomplishments throughout their career. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13063.835s">Sergeant</a> Bono and Guy Leone, I call them frickin' frack. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13068.86s">You</a> see one, you see the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13070.742s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13071.582s">I</a> don't know how they got their schedules to be like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13074.484s">You</a> saw one, you saw the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13076.866s">And</a> just two excellent officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13079.928s">I've</a> always felt safe with them on the street, Mr. President, and having them out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13084.572s">And</a> Sergeant Bono, with his oversight and being a supervising officer, has always done a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13093.979s">And</a> again, they both will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13097.724s">I</a> would ask that they receive council accommodations, Mr. President, for each having 36 years of committed and dedicated service to the residents and property of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13112.342s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1017.054s">Mr.</a> President, also, if we can get a commitment that Desmond is not going to run for local public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1026.139s">What</a> do you have to worry about? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1030.162s">A</a> true politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1032.603s">Desmond,</a> if you could just relay, we've had other recipients come before us, and I know a big part of becoming an Eagle Scout <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1041.709s">are</a> the many adventures that you go on, but also the community service part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1046.634s">And</a> what project you've done to obtain the community service aspect.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1111.078s">That's</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1112.298s">And</a> every Eagle Scout that we've spoken with always states that it wasn't just solely their effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1120.582s">It</a> was other people that helped them along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1123.863s">And</a> I know you have a few people with you today.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1476.611s">Mr.</a> President, can we take the elections paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1479.313s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1479.713s">While</a> we're under suspension.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1728.196s">I</a> defer, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1862.886s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1863.987s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1864.647s">While</a> we're in suspension, we take paper 21-508 communications from city offices and employees.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2103.521s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2104.841s">We</a> happen to have Sandy Gale that's here, who's the acting elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2110.622s">So</a> I was wondering if she could step to the podium, just basically tell this council the need for early voting in this community and her staffing levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2125.206s">And</a> I want to make sure that we administratively are able to pull this off, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2131.828s">in</a> a very important city election.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2222.233s">So</a> through you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2224.615s">So,</a> Sandy, the coverage of the poll that's gonna be here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2232.061s">Is</a> that done with existing city employees or <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2234.999s">of</a> these poll workers that would come in?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2285.953s">So</a> just so I understand, it's not done with existing registrar voters employees.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2385.796s">And</a> my other question, I did read through Chapter 29 of the Acts of 2021.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2391.645s">And</a> I thought I read and correct me if I'm wrong, there's language in there for people that are unable to attend the in-person <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2400.462s">voting</a> that would allow the registrar voters office to actually go out to homes and have people vote by ballot.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2449.142s">And</a> does that need to happen in conjunction with the days that we approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2453.364s">Or</a> does that happen right up until the election?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2478.398s">And</a> that's great, and I think part of offering this is also notifying the public that it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2484.7s">Because</a> when I read the acts, I wasn't familiar with some of it myself, and I've been around for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2490.642s">So</a> I think part of the outreach that will be done between now and the plenary and the general election should include that outreach, what options people have available. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2500.585s">So</a> I'd ask that that be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2502.946s">Have</a> you had the opportunity to put a monetary value on <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2508.408s">what</a> it's gonna cost the city to provide each day with having election employees as well as I would assume you'd need a police officer present for the time and any other associated costs with allowing the in-person voting?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2548.379s">Yeah,</a> that's ballpark. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2550.38s">And</a> that would be based on the number of days that you offered the full for the preliminary?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2561.647s">So</a> that's for two days of early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2565.96s">Based</a> on what you're telling me, I feel very comfortable, especially knowing the preliminary election in this community typically has a real low turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2576.834s">And</a> I think having the early voting in person voting <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2580.205s">for</a> four days sounds kind of excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2583.826s">Friday</a> to me is kind of a lost day because Friday City Hall closes at 1230. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2588.788s">So</a> you're really only getting four hours on a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2590.889s">I</a> much prefer having the extended hours on the Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2595.542s">for</a> those that may be working and can't make it during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2598.525s">So</a> I would support and put it in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we have the early in-person voting for the preliminary on Wednesday, September 8th, from 8.30 to 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2614.698s">That's</a> normal business hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2616.379s">And</a> Thursday, September 9th, from 8.30 to 4.30, and that's for the preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2622.422s">and</a> Wednesday, October 27th, 8.30 to 7.30, and Thursday, October 28th, 8.30 to 4.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2629.106s">From</a> my tabulations, that's 19 hours of additional in-person options that people have in addition to mail-in ballots and so forth and other options that they may have, Mr. President, for voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2645.577s">So</a> I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2716.333s">I</a> just don't know why this would be any more controlled than any other poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2720.856s">Don't</a> we follow the same standards?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2774.914s">So</a> at this point, Mr. President, I'll listen to what my colleagues have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2779.216s">I</a> will withdraw the motion I put forth for the general election and listen to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2787.44s">I</a> do want to say, Mr. President, that it's vital that we have an election coordinator in position <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2795.131s">which</a> this council has been pushing for for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2799.294s">And</a> Sandy Gill has been our election coordinator for all intents and purposes for a couple of decades now in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2809.28s">As</a> we found out, Sandy is acting and the administration's working on apparently <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2817.635s">uh,</a> posting the position and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2819.917s">But</a> we also heard from the city administration less than an hour ago that they like to get people into acting roles and then push them into the role, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2831.046s">And</a> here we have someone <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2832.928s">that's</a> been acting, doing the job, a very capable person. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2836.689s">That's</a> another thing we heard from the city administration, that they wanna make sure if they are gonna put someone in an acting role, they're capable, and then also have the ability to do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2846.69s">And</a> here we have someone that's capable doing the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2849.951s">I</a> don't know what the hangup is, but in my opinion, 26 years elected in this city, Mr. President, the integrity of our election process is of the utmost importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2862.959s">And</a> if people lose confidence in how we run an election, Mr. President, I don't want to be around for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2869.341s">So</a> I think it's important that we have a coordinator, the council recognize that, while waiting for the city administration to follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2876.323s">And</a> it's vital, Mr. President, we have someone in that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2880.565s">I</a> appreciate Sandy's and the acting role, and I think it's about time the city administration gets off their duff and does something, Mr. President, in order to maintain <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2890.995s">of</a> the integrity and security of our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2893.395s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2893.896s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2894.456s">Councilor</a> Raul.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3455.453s">Based</a> on the recommendation of our elections coordinator for the preliminary, I withdrew my recommendations for the general election.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3639.736s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3678.124s">I'd</a> ask that we sever that vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3684.05s">take</a> them as two distinct votes, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3711.663s">Mr.</a> President, if I could.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3713.931s">Just</a> if I could, it was only roughly, I think less than a month ago that a member of this council offered a resolution to do away with the preliminary altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3724.757s">And</a> here we have a preliminary that's gonna take place and now we're adding days, which I'm not opposed to, I'm opposed to that many days, but now we're adding days from going to eliminating the preliminary to adding days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3738.524s">I</a> just think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3741.632s">I</a> don't know where we're going, Mr. President, you know, unless it's just, you know, on a whim that we go back and forth, but it doesn't make much sense to me.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3776.891s">But</a> that wasn't the original intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3778.953s">The</a> original intent was to have a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3781.516s">And</a> this council thought better because <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3784.121s">We</a> didn't even have the full number of people that were gonna run. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3787.722s">We</a> didn't even know if we were gonna have a preliminary election.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3792.905s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3793.465s">But</a> I don't know how we go from one extreme to another, but I guess everyone's entitled to their opinion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3800.288s">But</a> my vote is based on the recommendation from our election coordinator that's been in this community for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3808.131s">And</a> to think that because of the election in this preliminary, that there's gonna be some strange turnout <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3814.426s">I</a> think is misguided, very misguided, Mr. President, but that's my own opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3819.168s">We</a> shall see.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3832.434s">Councilor</a> Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3833.895s">Just</a> before you call, so if this happens to get voted down, Mr. President, in the spirit of cooperation, if this happens to get voted down, there will be no early, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3843.966s">in</a> voting at all for the poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3848.69s">And</a> so a three to three vote is eliminating it altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3853.533s">So</a> rather than having four days or two days, we're gonna have zero days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3857.096s">So</a> in the interest of negotiation, Mr. President, I just wanna put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3863.901s">So</a> no one's caught off guard because I know what I'm gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3876.04s">I'd</a> rather have 19 hours of in-person voting than zero.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3886.929s">No,</a> because you're not on the prevailing side. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3888.911s">You</a> have to be on the prevailing side.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3892.514s">I</a> may or may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3894.275s">Who</a> knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3898.779s">It's</a> a risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3901.902s">Let's</a> go.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3979.786s">Motion</a> to refer back to the regular audit business, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6272.363s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6274.444s">The</a> petitioner just mentioned variance, and we as a body do not issue variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6280.986s">That</a> is done by the Zoning Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6284.528s">So</a> that is not something that's under our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6286.669s">So</a> if something was done in West Medford through a variance, it's possible that it never made its way to the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6295.472s">This</a> request is for a petition for a grant of location. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6298.913s">which</a> would be approved by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6301.198s">So</a> maybe it is a matter of how this was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6304.705s">The</a> original one in West Method was presented as a variance and that was voted on by a separate board and commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6311.82s">and</a> this one is being presented differently, I don't know, but it doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President, because Mr. Salaam just mentioned a variance and we have nothing to do with variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6323.908s">And</a> regarding Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and everywhere else, to be quite frank with you, that's not the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6331.433s">And</a> in my opinion, if you're gonna use public land, you should pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6335.735s">That's</a> my own opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6337.563s">If</a> I wanted to build a porch, Mr. President, on my house, and it was one inch on a public sidewalk, one inch, it would not be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6346.629s">It</a> would not be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6349.331s">So</a> I think to sit back and say that they don't pay in other areas and this and that, that's up to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6356.396s">But</a> in this city, Mr. President, if you're going to use public land, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6359.935s">for</a> private entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6361.616s">Since</a> when is it our responsibility to make sure a citizen's bank has proper ADA compliance? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6369.282s">It's</a> not our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6370.563s">We're</a> willing to work with them, Mr. President, but it's not our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6375.918s">So</a> I think there has to be some give and take here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6378.599s">And</a> my question, Mr. President, if we could, I agree with Councilor Scarpelli and my other council colleagues that this probably should be sent back, but definitely, Mr. President, we should find out regarding what West Medford, how it was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6395.627s">Was</a> it approved by a petition for grant the location or was it approved by a variance? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6402.482s">And</a> that's key if we move forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6405.605s">We</a> can't answer this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6407.466s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6408.227s">But</a> I would make that, Mr. President, in the form of a motion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6693.134s">Yeah,</a> that's it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6746.29s">If</a> it never came before the council, I don't recall it coming before the council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6788.186s">And-</a> President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading and just to give a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6793.827s">Do</a> we have anybody here from National Grid?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6964.445s">At</a> this time, I would ask that we amend the petition to include what the petitioner just mentioned, that it's not seven feet, it's 10 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6973.635s">and</a> that reflected in the approval by the city engineers, he also refers to seven feet.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7012.498s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7193.102s">Motion</a> to table, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7448.567s">Mr.</a> President, I, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7451.227s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7452.347s">I</a> would tend, I would feel more comfortable if we did get an opinion from the city solicitor, you know, and we did create a cannabis advisory commission for purpose and I don't want to overstep our boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7466.991s">The</a> resolution refers to include, include to me is asking them to put it in there, not asking them whether they would review or take it under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7478.054s">Changing</a> the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7478.674s">You're</a> asking them to include it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7480.407s">So</a> I just would feel more comfortable having city solicitor to take a look at it, yeah.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7531.862s">I</a> wouldn't be opposed to that, or I wouldn't be opposed to receiving it and placing it on file, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7554.816s">21-</a> Mr. President, just for the edification, because the city solicitor is going to want to know what we're referring to and for what purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7561.401s">And</a> the purpose, I think, at least for me, is to find out whether or not we have the authority to request that in a separate board. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7571.358s">or</a> a separate commission by state statute that's created. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7575.944s">So</a> that would be the question I have, whether we have the authority.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7783.785s">The</a> mic's on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7785.066s">The</a> mic's on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7879.701s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7880.582s">Mr.</a> President, if I could, Aggie's not on the call.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7885.943s">Because</a> Aggie we know best, but from my previous experience, the state statute is very clear about the removal of a public shade tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7894.786s">And</a> Aggie falls that to the T. And my experience states, unless it's an emergency, that it requires the tree be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7904.669s">So</a> the tree will officially get a posting on it, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7907.041s">And</a> I believe it requires a public hearing for any removal of the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7911.465s">And</a> that is duly posted as well as Mr. Castagnetti said. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7915.708s">And</a> I've never heard of the one or two day notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7919.431s">It's</a> more like seven to 14 or maybe even longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7923.635s">So</a> if trees are being removed, it may be an emergent nature or it may be the city's no longer following state statute, which I highly doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7936.868s">Mr.</a> President, but it's about time we take a look at our own tree ordinance, which we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7942.612s">By</a> the way, we don't have anything that protects public shade trees on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7947.755s">There's</a> been a lot of talk over the years, but very little action. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7951.437s">And</a> I think this is a perfect time, maybe to send something to a subcommittee, maybe the public works subcommittee, um, and have them take a look at the creation of a tree ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7963.145s">Mr.</a> President,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8087.797s">Yeah,</a> I'm not quite sure what we're gonna discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8090.799s">The</a> action was to wait for the state legislature to enact a piece of legislation, which never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8101.124s">I</a> mean, I guess we can meet to talk, because we have nothing else to do.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8141.975s">And</a> I don't believe that council has the authority to put a 90 day shot clock on a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8147.997s">So</a> I think the council overstepped its boundaries, but needless to say, Mr. President, I'm not sure quite what will be the discussion on a piece of legislation that hasn't been passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8158.219s">So</a> that we need to give local cities and towns the authority to make a pilot and in lieu of tax payment mandatory for certain entities. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8169.882s">And</a> if that legislation is not passed, I'm not sure what the subcommittee's use is. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8174.825s">If</a> you're looking just for the council to give a vote of support on the legislation, then I don't think that was the correct place to send it to a subcommittee for that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8185.673s">That's</a> what was passed, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8190.976s">I</a> just don't know what we're going to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8194.098s">What</a> do we discuss? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8195.239s">Something</a> that may eventually be passed by the state legislature?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8238.235s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8239.056s">So</a> in my opinion, Mr. President, and maybe this is the conversation we're going to have at subcommittee, but in my opinion, Mr. President, the city is what needs to put together a framework regarding in lieu of tax payment.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8253.127s">And</a> there is no current, as far as I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8257.194s">game</a> plan within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8259.116s">And</a> I was one of the first members when I first got on the council to request Tufts University, which never gave it a little tax payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8267.004s">And</a> I was one of the first to initiate that Mr. President, and then Mayor McGlynn signed a 10 year pilot program, which was severely <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8277.508s">underfunded,</a> in my opinion, or not what it should have been for such an institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8282.35s">But</a> needless to say, Mr. President, this legislation doesn't say that the cities and towns have the authority to create their own policy or procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8292.674s">This</a> states that it goes from voluntary to mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8296.576s">That's</a> a huge change, Mr. President, that could potentially impact every church in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8303.782s">And</a> every nonprofit that's servicing homeless, that's servicing disabled, that's doing yeoman's work, Mr. President, this could have a giant impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8313.81s">So</a> I don't think it's as easy to say we should just support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8320.034s">This</a> has really far reaching impact on nonprofits, including churches, Mr. President, in this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8340.241s">That's</a> from the gentleman I talked to that I think you've been speaking with, and that probably initiated this with you, that will be left up to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8351.31s">Um,</a> so I was told that that will be left up to cities and towns.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8359.345s">But</a> well, that's that's the feedback I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8362.911s">Um,</a> you know, so <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8364.377s">And</a> I as one member, I'm not going to go after churches, Mr. President, or any other nonprofit that's doing social services for our constituency.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8385.909s">Why</a> don't you provide that language to us?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8389.992s">I'd</a> ask that you provide it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8391.052s">That's</a> not my understanding.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10400.048s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10724.249s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10726.625s">Um,</a> recently, the mayor's office submitted a press release regarding the strong stump removal in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10737.368s">And</a> from what I can gather, the mayor is subcontracting out to a private vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10744.829s">The</a> removal of I think the article stated 26 tree stumps in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10751.711s">The</a> last count that I think I received, which I think is sorely underestimated, was there was about 575 stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10760.516s">And</a> I believe it's much higher than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10763.658s">Just</a> from my informal, you know, cursory of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10769.623s">And</a> so it was quite disappointing to see a press release go out that addresses roughly 5% of the stumps that have been in this community for tens of years, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10786.516s">And</a> I am very disappointed to see that we couldn't deal with these stumps in one fell swoop rather than just piecemeal it once again <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10798.866s">Mr.</a> President, as we heard today, there's trees being cut down, and those will be added to the stump list, and we're never going to get ahead of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10806.952s">So</a> I have to express my disappointment with this latest attempt to get ahead of some of the concerns that I'm hearing from the community, which is stump removal, poor sidewalk conditions, and very poor road conditions in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10823.545s">And</a> I don't think that addresses anything by removing 5% of what we have out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10830.01s">It</a> doesn't sound like a game plan to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10832.032s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10844.202s">Mr.</a> President also. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10845.62s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10846.02s">Just</a> while we're on the topic of tree stumps and poor condition of our city streets and sidewalks, the mayor also came out with a press release recently, Mr. President, asking residents to adopt a catch basin. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10861.412s">So</a> we are now asking residents to clean catch basins, which I always thought for years, and I've always asked during budget, we have a contract out to clean catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10874.358s">So</a> I'm not quite sure what direction we're going in this community, Mr. President, but we have to start asking residents to clean catch basins, I think is way out of whack Mr. President, and that's not what we should be asking residents to do in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10889.285s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10967.293s">Thank</a> you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10969.034s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10971.555s">Mr.</a> President, if I could, it's not on the agenda, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention I did bump into a resident this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10980.02s">His</a> mother, elderly mother, lives on Dwyer Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10983.022s">It's</a> imperative that she gets out during the day <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10985.563s">and</a> exercise, but unfortunately she's unable to because of all the uneven sidewalk panels on Dwyer Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10993.447s">And</a> I'd ask, challenge any of my colleagues to go out and take a walk around Dwyer Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10998.369s">This</a> is not a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11000.35s">It's</a> a public road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11002.27s">It's</a> in deplorable condition, the road and the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11006.212s">And,</a> you know, I'm not going to put it formally, but these are the type of things, Mr. President, when you talk about quality of life, here's a woman that can't get out because they're afraid of a trip and fall hazard in front of her own home.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_sPI3fdyUva8/2024-11-19_sPI3fdyUva8.html">City Council 07-13-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=376.791s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=377.391s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=377.691s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=378.051s">If</a> he doesn't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=380.092s">I</a> do have a question about the language.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=646.841s">If</a> you want to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=648.681s">Okay,</a> then you're coming, okay.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=652.702s">If</a> you want to wait, we haven't approved the money yet.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1709.547s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1711.028s">I</a> was just wondering if the petition is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1714.05s">The</a> commissioner is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1715.051s">And</a> my question is, Mr. President, are there currently renovations other than ADA that are happening to Citizens Bank and that work triggered off additional ADA? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1729.225s">Upgrades.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1755.447s">The</a> question is, is Citizen Bank in the process of renovating the building and these renovations triggered off ADA upgrades? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1766.176s">How</a> did this come about?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1801.828s">Also,</a> Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1804.53s">Was</a> there any consideration of doing this work internally and not needing to take over city property?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1857.731s">In</a> my last point, Mr. President is under bullet point two under recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1864.037s">It</a> says that the engineering division recommends the existing encroachments be allowed to remain as long as they're in good condition or if they fall into disrepair or poor conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1877.691s">And</a> then it says the city will revoke the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1881.276s">So</a> I'm not sure what advantage that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1884.018s">Just</a> say, and I'm not saying this is gonna happen, these particular ramps fall into disrepair, they become an eyesore, they become unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1892.024s">We</a> revoke the license and guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1894.185s">They're</a> on our city sidewalk and we have an eyesore there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1898.108s">What</a> advantage is that to the city of revoking a license? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1903.192s">I'd</a> like to see something with a little more teeth, Mr. President, that they will not fall into disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1912.451s">or</a> that they maintain a certificate of condition on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1920.053s">So</a> they hire their own contractor to come out every year and make sure they're in proper condition and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1924.755s">So</a> I'd rather see that than we put a condition that will revoke a license and then be stuck with a ramp that is an eyesore that's dangerous and becomes a city responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1935.659s">So</a> that would be my recommendations for bullet point number two.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2133.447s">So</a> Mr. President, if I could- <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2136.747s">and</a> I appreciate that response. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2138.809s">So</a> is there anywhere in this document or in the proposed license agreement that talks about the liability of this particular structure? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2149.477s">Who's</a> liable if someone gets hurt on this structure?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2165.665s">Well,</a> I know, so maybe that question should be directed, but this is, I appreciate what the gentleman's saying, but this now is going to be located on a city sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2175.011s">and</a> we've been hearing about the building, the building, the building, we're talking about something on a public sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2180.935s">So</a> that would be another question, Mr. President, I have regarding liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2185.397s">Who</a> would be responsible, Mr. President, regarding the liability if someone were to get hurt on that particular structure?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2201.627s">We</a> can offer it to the city solicitor, that's fine.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2264.145s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2265.166s">And</a> also Mr. President on the bullet point too, if we can get maybe the city engineer to rework that <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2271.552s">I</a> just don't feel comfortable with the city revoking a license with a structure that's left on our public sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2279.295s">Understood.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2726.612s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2727.092s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2727.732s">I</a> wanna thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2730.793s">You</a> know, it's sad when someone leaves that you've worked with for so many years and not being able to thank them before they leave, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2740.536s">And</a> I too wanna thank Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2743.217s">You</a> know, there were many times we didn't agree on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2746.478s">There</a> were many times that we were at odds as a council and, you know, as a finance department <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2754.135s">But</a> you can always rest assured that Alicia spoke from her heart and she spoke from a position of knowledge and authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2764.075s">And</a> that was much appreciated, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2767.038s">Even</a> things that potentially would benefit this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2770.901s">Alicia</a> was the first to tell us that during budget time that we were offering suggestions that probably would have been approved if we offered them in a different fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2784.651s">And</a> we found out that in this budget session that we had more abilities as a council <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2790.696s">to</a> make changes to the budget than we were ever explained in all the years I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2796.518s">And</a> I think it was largely due in part to Alicia realizing her responsibility as the budget finance director in the community, but also realizing that in order to have city government operate that I think all parties have to be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2815.263s">and</a> I think she keenly understood that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2818.725s">So</a> I will sorely miss her experience and knowledge, her breadth of knowledge when it comes to finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2825.63s">And</a> I hope the city can find someone pretty quickly to fill her shoes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2832.554s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5752.178s">and</a> ask too, was there money allocated in the budget for a parking clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5758.92s">Was</a> there a line item that at least had $1 in it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5764.602s">Yes,</a> there is.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6199.548s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6201.068s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6201.829s">But</a> the position titles have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6204.629s">Do</a> you not agree with that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6210.41s">They</a> have changed, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6212.611s">So</a> two months ago, we were talking about having a diversity slash human resource, and you spoke in favor of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6222.224s">Now</a> we're having a people person, chief people officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6228.348s">And</a> you're speaking in favor of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6230.089s">The</a> one consistent thing has been your salary has increased from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6235.232s">That's</a> been the one consistent thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6236.833s">So</a> you may not have a title, but your salary has been consistent over that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6243.537s">That</a> was not approved by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6247.039s">That</a> was not approved by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6249.641s">And</a> according to the city solicitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6251.809s">it</a> needed to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6253.993s">And</a> that's not up for debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6257.059s">That</a> is the city solicitor's legal opinion, which is not a precedent for debate.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6268.849s">I'm</a> not questioning your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6269.93s">I'm</a> not questioning your worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6271.11s">I'm</a> not questioning your ethics. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6272.291s">I'm</a> not questioning any of that, just so you know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6274.652s">Osborne.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6275.392s">But</a> my question is regarding policy and procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6278.854s">And</a> clearly the policy and procedure has not been followed by this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6283.837s">And</a> that's what we're trying to get to the bottom of. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6285.578s">So</a> even though there may be a sense of frustration because the title is not there, there is a process that we have to follow.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6370.384s">Mr.</a> President, I just wanted to make the point, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6374.787s">I</a> as one member, I can't speak for my colleagues, was never opposed to creating a position title. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6381.029s">What</a> I was opposed to Mr. President is paying someone out of a calf, paying someone out of a calf that was never approved by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6391.451s">And</a> that's always been the way it's been working in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6394.332s">And</a> that's no fault of Mr. Osborne. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6397.053s">I'm</a> not even referring to Mr. Osborne because there are other positions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6401.918s">And</a> those positions are eventually going to be before us as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6406.059s">So</a> this has nothing to do with Mr. Osborne. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6408.119s">He</a> happened to come up here tonight because he was probably asked by the mayor to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6411.92s">But</a> this has nothing to do with the person in the position, Mr. President, but all to do with following policy and procedure, which is very important in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6421.982s">Because</a> if that doesn't happen, things can go astray. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6425.502s">And</a> I don't want things to go astray, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6889.128s">Just</a> if I could, just for clarification, the elections coordinator position, I think this was asked by Councilor Bears during the budgetary session, but once this CAF is approved, there is funding in the budget for full-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6902.772s">Will</a> the person that currently is in that role be paid at that CAF until someone is hired? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6910.614s">Madam</a> Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6914.015s">Can</a> you just repeat that question, Councilor Marks, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6917.232s">So</a> the election coordinator position, once this CAF is approved, there's funding in the budget that CAF will exist with a person that's currently in a similar position within the registrar of voters office be paid until someone under that CAF, until someone is hired for the position.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6944.695s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6945.554s">Right,</a> but you have someone that's in the position now doing the function. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6950.841s">And</a> I hope, what's that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6956.573s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6956.993s">But</a> for all intents and purposes, I mean, I won't speak for the clerk, but I think the person is doing that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6963.517s">Um,</a> so to me, uh, I thought we had an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6968.12s">I</a> know you brought up council of beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6969.521s">I</a> don't want to speak for you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6981.312s">It's</a> my understanding that grant ran out, and so they won't be paid as of, the city clerk can answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6988.295s">It's</a> my understanding that money dried up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6995.617s">But</a> where are we gonna get the money from?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7027.884s">That's</a> the only thing that was approved in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7030.546s">Unless</a> there's funding that I'm not aware of.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7055.027s">If</a> the grant's right up at the end of June and we're already two weeks into July, how is this person being paid?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7288.113s">Okay,</a> so with the response, where it's getting paid from, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7579.251s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7582.027s">uh,</a> just for my edification, have all newly elect, uh, new, uh, newly created positions been advertised, uh, Mr. President, all newly created positions.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7616.813s">Right,</a> so even positions that people may be currently holding right now, those positions have not been advertised?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7628.837s">Well,</a> if we have a newly created position, I don't want to call out any particular position, but if there's a newly created position, have they all been advertised?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7641.92s">They</a> have not.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7647.301s">So</a> we potentially have people in roles where a position has not been advertised.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7684.935s">If</a> that's a newly created position, how do we not advertise for that position?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7708.749s">But</a> that's a newly created position, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7710.59s">That</a> never existed before.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7733.755s">So</a> I think here we go back again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7735.396s">I</a> thought we were all on the same page with the creation of calves. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7739.181s">and</a> the budget doesn't create, the fact that something's in the budget does not create a position according to city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7748.236s">I</a> thought we were all on the same page with that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7800.016s">So</a> I think- Right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7802.258s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7805.0s">So</a> if the consistency of- <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7808.7s">for</a> new position is to have it advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7812.463s">I</a> wanna make sure across the board we're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7815.485s">And</a> it seems to me we're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7817.207s">We're</a> picking and choosing when we wanna advertise for positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7821.25s">And</a> I don't think that's correct.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7838.411s">I</a> thought every new position has to be posted, but maybe I'm mistaken.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_4FrRjkCyMqA/2024-11-19_4FrRjkCyMqA.html">City Council 06-29-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=56.883s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=57.844s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=60.246s">Patrick</a> Gordon has been an instrumental part of this team since he came on with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=66.892s">And</a> in particular, Mr. President, over the 18 or so months of the pandemic, Patrick was the one that brought us into the 21st century, allowing us to communicate with our constituents that were unable to attend meetings during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=82.88s">And</a> he was instrumental in bringing up Zoom for us, not only for the council meeting, but many other public meetings in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=90.904s">And</a> I credit him, actually, for having us keep open government during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=98.447s">And</a> I wish him well in his new endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=101.088s">And</a> hopefully, at some point, we'll see him again, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=352.543s">Just</a> just if I could customize on I've stated this on many occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=356.707s">The</a> city of method charges a 5% fee on cable bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=361.685s">And</a> that 5% fee is a franchise fee that's supposed to go to PEG access, which is public education and government channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=370.494s">Only</a> 2% of the fee goes back into providing local programs, educational programs, and government access, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=378.903s">The</a> rest, the 3%, goes into the general office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=382.325s">And</a> I think what we're seeing, Mr. President, this has nothing to do with Patrick, what we're seeing is a sorely underfunded PEG local access station, you know, not similar to other communities that have a large office with multiple employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=397.073s">But</a> here we are with one employee and an assistant, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=401.882s">which</a> just is not enough to run a peg access in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=405.484s">So</a> I respectfully ask once again, that this be looked at by the city administration and fully fund peg access. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=414.09s">So</a> the residents can reap the benefits, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1568.364s">Councilor</a> Markswell. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1570.082s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1571.263s">And</a> I want to thank all our superior officers in this community that haven't missed a beat over the last 18 months during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1581.567s">This</a> is, in my opinion, a very modest raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1585.709s">It's</a> comparable to other raises with other unions throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1591.452s">And</a> where this has been outstanding since, as we stated, 2019, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1598.623s">I've</a> been on record for many occasions not waiving the three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1603.905s">And</a> the reason why, Mr. President, is that the three readings require open transparency within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1613.109s">And</a> I've always been opposed to waiving the readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1615.83s">However,</a> in certain circumstances, Mr. President, when, in my opinion, when raises the three years and arrears, that those are the certain circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1626.835s">Tonight,</a> Mr. President, I will be supporting not only this paper, but I will offer the formal motion that the three, what do you call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1640.667s">Readings.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1641.228s">Readings,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1642.529s">The</a> three readings be waived, Mr. President, based on the fact that this has been outstanding for over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1649.075s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1650.296s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1650.776s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1651.917s">Any</a> further discussion?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1697.807s">And</a> if we could just record the waiving of the three readings, Mr. President, because of the contract being in arrears for almost three years.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1745.493s">No,</a> that was the one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1746.473s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1747.793s">It</a> was a different number, but the number was changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1749.874s">The</a> number was changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1750.474s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1816.939s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1817.799s">I</a> want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1821.02s">Ricky</a> Sweeney, if you knew him, you loved him. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1823.941s">That</a> was the type of person he was, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1827.242s">32</a> years as a firefighter, past Vice President of Local 1032, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1832.007s">As</a> Councilor Knight mentioned, an outstanding member of the Method, an active member of the Method Elks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1838.452s">And</a> I want to send my condolences to his wife, Kelly, his children, Aaron, Jen, and his firefighter son, Joseph, who serves currently as Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1848.94s">And</a> anyone that knows Ricky knew he loved to spend time in Maine and loved to be around his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1855.785s">And</a> the one thing that I hear over and over from people was, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1860.506s">that</a> I guess Ricky was a master carpenter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1863.868s">And</a> if he ever needed any help, he was the first to come with his skills, Mr. President, and assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1871.433s">And</a> never looking for anything other than the fact that he liked to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1875.696s">So</a> I'd like to, if Councilor Knight seems fit to, I'll have you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1884.181s">Honor</a> him by naming this meeting, Mr. President, in his honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1888.772s">And</a> I want to thank council vice president for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1891.675s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1892.695s">And</a> how's this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2057.561s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2058.842s">It's</a> my honor to stand before this council and the residents of this community to honor one of Medford's finest, Mr. President, Teresa Castagnetti, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2068.797s">I</a> think we all, behind this reel, know Teresa. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2072.818s">Teresa</a> was an advocate for our students, serving as the lead teacher and coach for the English Learners Department for many decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2083.621s">Teresa</a> had a career that was remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2087.262s">She</a> always stood up for what she believed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2089.623s">Even</a> recently, as of last year, Mr. President, when the condition of the sidewalks and the curbing and the road into the McGlynn <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2098.375s">and</a> Andrews Middle School was in poor condition and caused trip and hazards for parents, children, and faculty, Teresa was the first one to step forward and kept on stepping forward, bringing this council up to date on the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2116.768s">And</a> it was Teresa Castagnetti that I largely credit for making those things happen within that area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2126.787s">Teresa</a> worked in the Kids' Corner daycare as executive board chairperson and secretary from 1992 to 95. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2135.293s">So</a> in addition to her duties as a lead teacher, she also found the time to work in the Kids' Corner daycare as an executive member, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2145.419s">Back</a> in 2015, annual state award given to a teacher who exemplifies excellence in the education of English language learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2154.833s">through</a> evidence of best instructional practices, long-term commitment to the education of ELLS, leadership roles at the school's district, level of behalf of the ELLs, mentoring of new ELL teachers through formal induction programs, and strong relationships to parents of ELLs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2178.479s">So</a> back in 2015, Teresa received the Distinguished Award <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2184.053s">Teacher</a> of the Year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2185.874s">It's</a> a statewide award, and believe me, they were able to recognize the merits of Teresa Castagnetti and her accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2196.741s">Teresa</a> served as the ELE teacher for the Medford Public Schools from 2016 to 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2201.564s">Teresa</a> was a mentor teacher for the Medford Public Schools from 2001 to 2021, over 20 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2212.89s">She</a> was a supervising practitioner for several general education teachers and Lesley University graduate students to complete their 150-hour internship towards ESL licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2225.535s">And</a> from 2008 to 2014, Teresa was selected by DESE to participate on several DESE panels and committees for assessment and development standard settings for the Statewide Language Proficiency Exam and train the trainer cohorts <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2242.846s">and</a> second language learning and teaching, in which Teresa, in turn, provided professional development for the district, right here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2252.55s">Teresa</a> also served as co-chairperson for the McGlynn Elementary School literacy team. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2257.892s">And</a> in 2008, 2009, Teresa co-chaired the creation of the district's first school-based literacy team, which established uniform K through five literacy assessment protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2270.096s">and</a> a building-wide K-5 literacy action plan for the McGlynn Elementary School, which was adopted as a model for the district, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2279.122s">I</a> can only say, Mr. President, that knowing Theresa over the years, knowing her professionalism, the way she dealt with her colleagues, the way she dealt with parents, faculty, students, I think goes unmatched in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2296.574s">And</a> it's only appropriate that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2298.365s">I</a> rise here today thanking her for her 45 years of commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2302.127s">I</a> would ask that Teresa receive a council accommodation for her years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2306.788s">And</a> I also want to thank her, Mr. President, for putting up with Andrew Castagnetti, her lovely husband for many years, Mr. President, who we all know and love as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2321.194s">And</a> I just want to thank Teresa and wish her well on her retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2324.596s">And</a> I'm sure we're going to see her around the community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2583.703s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2584.703s">I</a> want to thank you for co-sponsoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2587.364s">Here</a> we are once again, Mr. President, another faculty member within our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2594.465s">42</a> years of dedication to the students, the parents, and to our Medford public school system, I think is something that really deserves recognition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2607.047s">Cheryl</a> Mayarco is a well-respected employee of the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2611.873s">in</a> the special ed department, who dedicated over 42 years of service to our most vulnerable students. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2619.235s">Cheryl</a> started a career in method as a substitute teacher and instructional aid in 1978. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2626.857s">Cheryl</a> became a special education teacher in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2631.358s">For</a> the past 20 years, Cheryl has worked tirelessly as an evaluation team leader, providing mentoring and guidance to newer ETLs <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2641.838s">and</a> staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2643.758s">Cheryl</a> was passionate about the Children of Method, acting as a strong advocate for student needs and making personal connections with every student she assisted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2656.22s">Cheryl</a> was dedicated to caring for the whole child, communicating with parents, caregivers, and educational team members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2664.722s">Cheryl</a> was always expanding her knowledge and her expertise to be prepared and responsive to families and students <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2671.93s">of</a> method. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2673.992s">Colleagues</a> and families remarked that Cheryl went over and above in assisting families and students with patience, positive attitude, and a caring nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2685.38s">And</a> for all of us that know Cheryl, Mr. President, know these words are completely true. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2692.285s">Cheryl</a> gave everything she could to her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2695.427s">She</a> liked what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2697.629s">She</a> excelled what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2699.886s">And</a> she really made, I think, a lot of strides in the special ed department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2706.852s">She</a> was someone that you can count on to make sure that if services were needed for a child, Cheryl would fight for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2714.378s">You</a> didn't need to hire an outside advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2716.6s">It</a> was Cheryl Mayorko that would step up and make sure that each and every child received the proper services, Mr. President, for their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2726.809s">And</a> parents respected that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2729.104s">um,</a> in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2730.845s">Uh,</a> you know, the my uncle couple, which I refer to as Cheryl, my uncle and Robert, my uncle, who served on this body for over three decades, um, and the capacity of council president is and as a member of this body, uh, they were a power couple in this community, Mr. President, for many decades, and both were well respected and leaders in this community, and they continue to be leaders in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2757.224s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2758.242s">I</a> would personally like to ask Mr. President that Cheryl Mayarco receive a council accommodation for her 42 years of dedicated service to our students, our most vulnerable students, parents, faculty, and the entire community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2777.428s">I</a> would like to thank her.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3018.27s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3019.67s">This</a> was an item that was put on the agenda last week under public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3024.912s">And</a> we had a number of residents that came up to speak on their concerns regarding the now, I guess, resolved issue of the naming of the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3035.796s">That</a> was somewhat of a lengthy process that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3039.618s">I</a> believe there was much division in the community over this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3044.12s">Many</a> people felt that they weren't heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3047.282s">Many</a> people felt that they weren't part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3050.283s">And</a> what I'm offering here tonight, Mr. President, is that we take a closer look at the naming of any building in the community, whether it's on the school side or the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3063.369s">As</a> a member of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3065.337s">I</a> can attest to you firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3067.598s">I</a> actually am one of the members that actually voted against the naming of one of our schools back some 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3077.261s">And</a> it wasn't because I was opposed to the name, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3080.502s">It</a> was more of a process issue I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3083.383s">And</a> at the time, I felt there wasn't enough public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3086.685s">There</a> wasn't enough community participation in regards to the selection of the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3091.326s">And</a> therefore, I actually voted against <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3093.951s">the</a> naming of one of our, what we refer to as new schools now that are 20 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3099.736s">I</a> would say, Mr. President, that in a community of this size, when you're talking about naming a school building, and know that many of these buildings, whether it's a municipal building, or a park, or the corner of an intersection that's named, this has personal memories to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3119.573s">It</a> has personal feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3122.91s">And</a> I think we have to be very mindful of that when we have a process to look at the renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3129.832s">I'm</a> not opposed to renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3131.533s">I'm</a> not opposed to looking at things in retrospect, but what I am opposed to Mr. President is a process where people feel left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3141.755s">And</a> if one person feels left out, that's enough for me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3146.377s">And</a> I'm respectfully asking that we ask our city solicitor <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3151.292s">I</a> don't doubt for a second that the school committee has the authority to name a building, and I've told people that over the past year and a half, that they have the ability to name a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3161.719s">All</a> I'm asking is whether or not the Medford City Council, through way of an ordinance, can create a policy, Mr. President, that includes the entire community when it comes to looking at municipal or school-owned buildings, and that we create <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3179.8s">a</a> policy and procedure that ultimately has the goal of incorporating every comment, every person's wishes, and coming out with a process that we can all feel proud of at the end and not have the division that we're seeing right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3198.614s">And</a> that's all this is trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3200.856s">This</a> is not trying to take away anyone's responsibilities, anyone's duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3205.719s">It's</a> seeing a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3207.821s">When</a> I see a community divided, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3209.794s">That</a> concerns me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3210.495s">I've</a> been around a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3212.336s">And</a> when I see a community divided over an issue, we as legislators, the executive branch, I think have to step up and say, how do we better this process? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3222.184s">How</a> do we make it so we don't have to go through this every time we may decide that we want to rename something? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3228.69s">And</a> I feel that if this process continues in the manner it's going, all it's going to do is create division. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3236.756s">And</a> that would include on the municipal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3239.446s">So</a> I'm not saying this is strictly a school issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3242.167s">It's</a> on the municipal side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3243.508s">So</a> I'm saying, open up the process to the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3247.109s">And</a> those are my comments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3248.89s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3315.89s">So,</a> Mr. President, I appreciate those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3319.031s">And</a> I would only state that what I'm trying to do through this resolution <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3323.679s">is</a> ask our chief legal officer, who is attorney Kim Scanlon, whether or not we first of all have the jurisdiction and authority to create an ordinance that would cover a separate body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3336.045s">The</a> school committee is a separate body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3337.425s">They're</a> an autonomous body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3339.006s">And</a> I understand the boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3341.667s">However,</a> we are the legislative body for the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3345.069s">And</a> the school committee falls under the purview of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3349.911s">And</a> if the <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3352.171s">solicitor</a> came back and said, I don't believe that you can do that as a council through way of ordinance, to me, then the issue would be dropped by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3360.194s">I'm</a> not gonna pursue anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3362.375s">But</a> if the city solicitor came back and said, indeed, you have the ability to do that, I think that would call for a subcommittee or committee of the whole, maybe even a joint meeting with the school committee and the administration to discuss next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3375.399s">But</a> all I'm doing is asking what our options are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3380.454s">and</a> not forcing anything on anyone at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3383.955s">So</a> that's all I wanna get across, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3521.386s">I</a> think that's what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3522.606s">And</a> I'm not opposed to change the language around, but I think that's what it says.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3553.655s">Why</a> don't we just say something that's almost exactly what it says.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3559.758s">Next</a> time I'll put you on the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3562.44s">Co</a> sponsor and how about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3565.401s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3570.204s">It's</a> almost says verbatim what you just stated.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3967.946s">Any</a> further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3970.025s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could, I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3974.889s">And</a> you know, when you when you hear accolades like this, Mr. President, you see who is living in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3982.316s">You</a> know, we have a wealth of resources and untapped ability and knowledge in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3988.781s">And</a> Ben would have been a great asset for this community to give guidance and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3994.346s">So</a> I think we really need to take a long look <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3997.544s">at</a> our volunteer program within the community, even if one exists, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4003.128s">And</a> I think, you know, being, having the ability to tap into, for instance, Ben would have been invaluable during COVID and when you're discussing PPE and everything else associated with his experience and his knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4015.996s">So</a> I wanna thank Ben and I thank my colleague for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4019.938s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4175.294s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4179.075s">Has</a> there been any temporary work done? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4180.796s">So</a> if it is leaking now, until this work gets done, that you won't have any damage or lose documents?

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4221.534s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4859.371s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4865.272s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4869.756s">The</a> questions I would have, Mr. President, surround, you know, we're talking about city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4875.219s">It's</a> very possible that if there's a third candidate into the mayor's race, that that could trigger off a preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4883.785s">And</a> as we all know, Mr. President, depending on the number of people running for an office has an impact on the potential impact on the outcome of that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4894.092s">I</a> think there's a lot to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4896.693s">Also,</a> I think anytime a body that could be perceived as doing something self-serving is something that you have to proceed with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4906.735s">And</a> indeed, in my opinion, and I've stated this for years, the fact that the Bedford City Council is in order in the general election, an alphabetical order, and all the challenges are after us, it's a known fact that when it comes to the election process, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4923.346s">your</a> positioning on the ballot has an impact on, you know, what you may get for votes, you know, the first and the last, and there's a whole science to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4934.949s">And</a> believe me, I don't wanna be someone that may be perceived as putting forth something that may impact someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4943.791s">You</a> know, a new candidate running for public office wants to know, and a primary is, a preliminary is a good way of doing it, wants to know their strengths and weaknesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4953.474s">And</a> that's an excellent way for a new candidate to say, you know what, I didn't do that well in the primary, I'm gonna focus on this area and this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4960.377s">What</a> you're effectively doing is taking that away from someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4965.1s">And</a> so there's a lot I think you have to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4967.901s">It's</a> not just, you know, the savings is great, but I would ask that when you look at an election in the community and when 30%, what's the last percentage in the municipal election, Mr. Clark? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4981.852s">when</a> 30% of the registered voters come out, we should be promoting elections, whether they're preliminary or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4990.234s">I</a> mean, we should be, and I've thought about this for years, putting out banners and A-frames and getting the message out, promoting elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4998.877s">And</a> I think when you start to cancel elections, I think what you see is a cheapening of the election process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5007.413s">And,</a> you know, so I think there's a lot, I'm not throwing this down, but I just think there's a lot to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5014.3s">And,</a> you know, I'm not opposed to looking at this, but I really have some reservations on any time an elected a body that has a vested interest, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5024.93s">The</a> finance is one thing, but you also have a vested interest in getting reelected, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5030.376s">And</a> anytime you use your influence that may hinder someone else, whether you think it does or not, I mean, it's something that needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5038.941s">In</a> the past, Mr. President, and I think a couple of years ago, there was a letter sent out by one of the candidates asking all the other candidates, what are your thoughts on canceling the primary? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5049.806s">I</a> think there were one or two extra candidates, and why spend the money, as Councilor Bears mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5054.829s">And</a> we got a mixed bag back from candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5057.15s">Some</a> wanted to keep it, some were opposed, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5060.092s">So</a> I think these are the discussions I think we have to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5063.113s">So</a> I'm not opposed to what Vice President Knight mentioned about taking a closer look, but I'm not sold on, you know, canceling any primary at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5073.374s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6521.686s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6522.827s">And</a> I appreciate the mayor being here tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6525.367s">So</a> Madam Mayor, the response that we received from the administration answering some of our questions, the request for 50,000 for legal services, some of us read it as we're not receiving it and others read it as we are receiving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6542.296s">So</a> I was just wondering if you could clarify.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6590.499s">So</a> that being said then, Copeland and Page, KP Law, seem to be additional legal counsel for the administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6619.015s">So</a> the only reason why I ask is I agree, the city solicitor is the law of the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6624.276s">And</a> we actually have something before us that the city solicitor rendered an opinion, and the city administration is doubting the opinion of the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6634.228s">So,</a> but right, but if we're talking about a potential conflict, then you have KP law, which is an outside entity, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6650.462s">Not</a> according to your chief of staff, because he's debating on a question or an opinion that was issued by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6658.228s">And</a> that was regarding the CAFs and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6661.406s">And</a> it's still being debated now, I guess, that he's waiting for questions to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6666.39s">But</a> that was a legal opinion issue by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6670.213s">So</a> I'm just a little dumbfounded because the school committee has an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6675.076s">And</a> when I was on the school committee, we had an attorney we can go to as a school committee, but the council doesn't have any recourse regarding legal matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6684.303s">And</a> there are times where there could be potential conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6688.826s">And</a> we've had that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6690.424s">I</a> mean, we had an issue with billboards and we were on the council at the time, where the city solicitor was representing the administration and no one was representing the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6699.649s">So</a> I think all this council is asking for is a line item in those particular circumstances where we feel that there may be a potential conflict, not to surpass the city solicitor, she does a tremendous job, but in times that we feel necessary that we have to have legal advice <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6719.796s">as</a> a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6721.097s">And</a> I really can't fathom why the city administration would feel so intimidated that, you know, we have legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6729.984s">And</a> so no one's trying to circumvent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6733.407s">Also,</a> KP law was brought in at $60,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6737.931s">From</a> what we found out in this budget process, they have billed us over $150,000 for this past fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6743.716s">So</a> this great $5,000 a month <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6748.383s">No</a> longer seems like a great $5,000 a month, because as was stated, that covers certain, you know, legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6758.205s">And</a> I'm sure they've been requested by the city administration or other departments to assist in other things beyond that capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6764.946s">So</a> now we're looking at 150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6765.746s">And</a> as this council stated, we could probably put on an assistant city solicitor full time, as the office always existed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6775.928s">There's</a> always been as far as I remember, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6777.858s">There's</a> always been a solicitor and assistant city solicitor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6788.821s">I</a> don't doubt that, but it seems that KPLR is really now, I think they've issued, correct me if I'm wrong, they've actually issued legal opinions in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6798.883s">And</a> correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember seeing them issue legal opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6802.364s">And</a> the only one that can issue a legal opinion in this community is the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6807.22s">So</a> I think they've been utilized in a way that really, if it's infringing on anyone, it has been on our law office and possibly substituting for our law office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6818.365s">So</a> I would hope you just reconsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6820.986s">So</a> this doesn't call for 50,000 line items in our budget for legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6826.469s">No,</a> it does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6827.369s">Okay,</a> so that was a major sticking point for me and it's been a major sticking point for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6833.412s">So</a> just so you know, I thought, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6836.635s">we</a> were getting the $50,000 for legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6841.257s">But</a> at this point, I'll rest, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7081.053s">Mr.</a> President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7082.913s">Point</a> of information, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7084.414s">With</a> all due respect, it seems like the only one that's getting legal advice in the city is the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7090.075s">They</a> get KP Law at their beck and call, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7093.453s">and</a> they have the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7095.875s">So</a> with all due respect, I think all we're doing is asking that when issues arise, that we need that same ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7105.463s">That's</a> all we're asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7106.684s">No</a> one's asking to cut out KP law, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7109.707s">And</a> if there's a new fandango way of providing in-house legal services, that's better than how we've done it for years, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7118.371s">I</a> want to listen to it, but we've always had a city solicitor and an assistant city solicitor since I've been on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7124.193s">I</a> mean, so we're not asking to recreate the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7127.834s">And</a> I think what we're seeing now is the moving away from having an assistant city solicitor and the hiring of an outside company, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7135.996s">That's</a> the mayor and the administration's prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7139.017s">And</a> we're not looking to cut them out of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7142.238s">All</a> we're saying is that we'd like to see how it's operated in the past with assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7148.115s">And</a> that way we can have multiple legal opinions that actually trickle down to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7153.538s">Because</a> I can just tell you, it's not happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7156.36s">When</a> we have any type of legal question, we're not able to get answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7161.783s">Sometimes</a> we are, but other times we're not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7164.064s">So</a> I think that's the concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7165.865s">And</a> if there's some type of federal statute or state statute or whatever says that we can't do it, I'd like to see it and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7174.87s">Because</a> I'm not sure why we couldn't have <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7178.266s">legal</a> advice, Mr. President, in-house legal advice that works with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7184.489s">That's</a> all we're asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7185.129s">We're</a> not asking to go outside of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7187.65s">We're</a> not asking to do anything and having someone legally that, I mean, Kim Scanlon's one person, one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7194.573s">She</a> works with every board and commission, every department, police, fire, DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7199.976s">I'm</a> sure she gets questioned sometimes, even on the school side, even though they have their own lawyer that's been there for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7207.549s">So</a> that's one city solicitor, and I agree, that's not enough for the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7212.591s">But</a> I also rather see it in-house than outsourcing, and that figure keeps growing, the outsourcing figure, and I'd rather see it done in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7220.194s">That's</a> all I'm saying, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7221.655s">Councilor</a> Papantonio.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7835.556s">So</a> if a council comes up with a request, who's the gatekeeper of the request?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7852.033s">But</a> if we have this new process now where we have KP law, just say they assigned Joe Smith to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7857.595s">And</a> tomorrow the council says we want Joe Smith to look into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7860.837s">Does</a> it require your approval?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7870.783s">held</a> up, so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7909.68s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7910.141s">I</a> just want to make sure that we don't get into the circumstance where requests by this council are being denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7917.406s">Because</a> that defeats the whole purpose.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7924.792s">But</a> you see our point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7926.293s">We</a> don't want to be contingent upon <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7929.48s">Will</a> the mayor approve it or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7930.881s">You</a> know, I don't think we should operate as a body that way, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7934.783s">So</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7936.383s">And</a> I thought that's what the president was offering.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8005.079s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8006.24s">I</a> just wanna make sure if it's not often we do supplemental. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8009.421s">So</a> maybe Felicia can advise us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8013.182s">Alicia.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8028.231s">Vice</a> President Knight mentioned, I don't think we want to add, we want to subtract.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8729.544s">It</a> was just a doubling of the part-time cell, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8732.624s">I</a> think it was 32,000 and we just asked to double it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9093.13s">Mr.</a> President, you know, to me, I understand what my colleagues have stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9097.633s">And</a> naturally, I think, you know, if you're looking at a process, the CAF should be presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9105.956s">That</a> means the council either is on board with this new position or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9110.438s">So</a> to me, you would wanna do that before you say, well, will you fund this position? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9116.76s">And</a> then have the council come back and say, well, we don't agree with this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9120.402s">So</a> I think you would need a fundamental agreement of the position before you ask for the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9127.285s">So</a> that's just how I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9129.987s">But</a> the larger question I have for the mayor is that if the mayor agrees that the fact as council president mentioned that the mere fact that this may appear in the budget does not initiate the CAF process, meaning that it doesn't require a vote of the council because the approval is in place of <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9155.113s">the</a> vote of the council for the CAF, then we have a real fundamental difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9160.776s">Because</a> I believe, Mr. President, whether it's in the budget first or not, that it still requires a vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9168.279s">So</a> the creation of that position requires a formal vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9174.042s">And</a> I'd like to know the mayor's position on that, because from what I heard from the chief of staff, and I think this is some of the questions that he had, I don't know what the exact questions were, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9184.948s">regarding</a> the city solicitor's opinion, but he did state the other day that he sent a few questions to the city solicitor and they haven't been responded to yet regarding her opinion, but I won't put words in the chief of staff's mouth, but I believe he felt that the mere fact that we voted for a position that was in the budget, therefore, it doesn't require for you to come back before us to get approval of the CAF. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9208.973s">And</a> that's my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9209.914s">And</a> if that's the understanding of the administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9212.265s">then</a> at least me and the administration, we're on two completely different sides, Mr. President, because the CAFs are created by ordinance and the ordinance is a responsibility of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9223.373s">So</a> if the mayor is stating here tonight, which I think the response, and I won't speak to the mayor, the response is stating, you're going to look at these CAF positions and then present it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9233.921s">You</a> know, some members might have wanted it before the budget, but <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9237.427s">I'm</a> not gonna split hairs at this point, but if you're saying that this requires a vote of the council, otherwise you cannot put someone on, because currently right now we have someone that's working out of their calf and has been paid many, many months out of their calf without approval by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9256.802s">And</a> the fact that that is still ongoing leads me to believe that that is the position of the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9264.935s">that</a> it doesn't require this cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9266.356s">So</a> do you hear what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9268.757s">So</a> I'm kind of tossed because in one breath you're saying we're gonna present the cap to the council and the other breath, someone's being paid out of the cap because it was never approved by the council and they continue to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9283.083s">So</a> if you're able to at least shed some light, I know I put a lot out there, but I just wanna know fundamentally, if you believe that the caps are required vote of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9294.097s">And</a> even though the position may be funded in the budget, and there may be money July 1st for you, you cannot put someone on until that cap position exists within the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9306.525s">Do</a> you agree with that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9661.023s">Your</a> mic's off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9664.125s">Your</a> mic's off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9664.966s">My</a> mic's off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9666.147s">I</a> don't know how long it was off for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9669.269s">Just</a> for a second.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10312.833s">Mr.</a> President, at this point, I think the dog's chasing its tail right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10319.356s">And</a> I'm at a point right now, I believe we have a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10323.738s">Am</a> I happy how this rolled out? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10326.219s">No,</a> I'm not happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10327.32s">Do</a> I agree with my colleagues that this should have been presented ahead of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10331.101s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10332.322s">But</a> I'm hearing there's a commitment there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10335.175s">And</a> I think what I'm hoping is that the mayor will present this as quickly as possible, I'm hoping July. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10342.92s">But</a> when you look at some of these positions that are new, a director of parking, we were told the other night that we are gonna take on a new parking program in-house January 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10356.889s">It's</a> almost July, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10359.871s">Time</a> is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10361.732s">So</a> I can't see the administration holding off on these caps <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10365.32s">when</a> it's been their commitment, right, to provide parking enforcement in-house January 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10373.043s">So</a> I really believe that it's beneficial to the administration and crucial to the administration to keep their promises, not just to this council, but to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10384.608s">So</a> I feel very comfortable that these caps are gonna be presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10389.711s">And</a> I know moving forward, they'll be presented ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10392.852s">So</a> I feel, I have to say, I feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10395.791s">with</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10396.592s">You</a> know, we talk about facilities manager for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10400.154s">I</a> think there's a plan in place to create a facilities manager to oversee on the municipal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10405.998s">There's</a> one on the school side, but on the municipal side to look at all our buildings to make sure we're never faced again with a dilapidated DPW building, outdated police station, outdated fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10418.346s">So</a> I believe that's a commitment that if the mayor doesn't follow through with, it says, you know what, I'm not going to give them that cap for that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10426.374s">That</a> doesn't hurt the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10428.634s">That's</a> the mayor's commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10430.355s">That's</a> the administration's commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10432.915s">That's</a> one of those promises, Mr. President, that I read about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10436.916s">So</a> I feel comfortable that these positions are of utmost importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10442.557s">I'm</a> not happy with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10444.297s">I</a> agree with council on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10445.877s">But</a> I think at this point now, I really believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10449.178s">And</a> I wish we got it, like Councilor Falco mentioned, maybe several weeks ago and discussed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10453.499s">But</a> at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10455.383s">I</a> think, you know, we're obligated to move forward and go based on the commitment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10461.527s">And,</a> you know, I supported removing the money for the legal counsel, but at this point for these positions, I think we're gonna move forward with them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10474.234s">And,</a> you know, in the past, don't forget, we've had years, and I remember being on the council where they'll say they're gonna hire 18 new firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10482.799s">And</a> at the end of the fiscal year, we hired three. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10485.366s">and</a> there were $300,000 left over. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10488.107s">It</a> happens a lot, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10490.627s">And</a> for whatever reason, sometimes they're unable to get the people on board quick enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10499.008s">They're</a> unable to vet them or so forth, but it happens quite often. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10502.449s">I</a> don't think that's gonna be the case with these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10505.29s">So</a> I appreciate the fiscal responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10509.81s">I</a> appreciate the leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10511.331s">I'll</a> be the first to always talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10513.142s">That's</a> use the leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10514.022s">If</a> we have the leverage that's using, and I think that's an excellent way of using leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10519.144s">Take</a> it out of the budget now and say, Madam Mayor, when you come with the caps, we'll put it back in, like the supplemental, like the last issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10525.126s">That's</a> a great way of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10526.647s">I</a> don't think with these, we have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10529.508s">Now,</a> if the mayor proves me wrong, then I'll apologize to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10533.489s">But</a> at this point, I don't think we need to go down that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10536.57s">Council</a> Member, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10537.43s">It's</a> not about me.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10571.995s">No,</a> this is not personal at all.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10576.756s">And</a> just so you know, my differences of opinion is how we go about this, not that what you stated was incorrect or by no stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10585.318s">I</a> actually voted on your last proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10587.958s">I</a> just think we don't have to go down in this one direction on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10592.159s">Now,</a> Mr. President, as we go through this budget, I have a laundry list of other items, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10599.07s">that</a> I will be bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10600.49s">So</a> these are just, this is the, these are the items that they may have presented to us of just recent, I believe yesterday and today, but I have a number of other items that were not addressed Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10614.593s">So,</a> you know, at some point I'd like to go through those as well, but I just want them to be on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10619.994s">I</a> think we have to move forward with this issue is gone full circle, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10627.935s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10629.462s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11377.089s">I'll</a> yield to my colleague.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11412.478s">The</a> trees were the 15,000, then we asked for additional money for the 500 large stumps in the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11420.341s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11424.023s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11425.303s">And</a> what I wanted to do was, we were fortunate enough to have the mayor here, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11432.354s">There's</a> a few things, Mr. President, in the budget that, or we asked to be in the budget, or maybe partially funded in the budget that I have some concerns with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11442.638s">And</a> the first issue, Mr. President, is something that the Public Works Subcommittee has been working on under the direction of Chairman Beers, myself, and Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11456.563s">And</a> that is looking at the creation of a new ordinance to deal with <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11462.043s">snow</a> shoveling in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11465.846s">And</a> as part of the due diligence of the committee and meeting with the Brian Cairns, the head of DPW, meeting with the mayor's chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez, and meeting with the Chamber of Commerce, we have asked that the administration, in addition to potentially a new ordinance, also look at 26 miles of priority sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11491.926s">that</a> would create connectivity and all the business districts would create connectivity to our schools, to our senior housing, to our stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11504.772s">And</a> I thought along with the committee that this was a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11511.395s">We</a> were told at the time, because I mentioned about bringing up this in the budget and adding an additional 50,000 to the snow and ice budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11521.396s">And</a> at the time, which I think makes a lot of sense that, Mr. President, the statutory requirements is once you increase the snow and ice budget, you have to have that same dollar amount in there every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11533.458s">And</a> that hamstrings the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11535.779s">And</a> I think that's the last thing we wanna do as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11538.679s">However,</a> Mr. President, we did receive what I thought was a commitment, and this is probably the third time of us, and now we have the chief executive officer here, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11549.497s">I</a> believe we did receive a commitment that there would be money within the existing snow and ice to provide this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11557.54s">We</a> brought a figure of 26 miles, but give or take, I don't think we're hot fast on that number, but that there would be money within this year for this budget, for this snow period, from December to March, that we would provide that sidewalk priority listing throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11578.779s">And</a> I'm sure the mayor probably got wind of this, or if she hasn't, if this is the first time she's hearing about it, then I'd like to see if we can get some type of commitment, again, from the chief executive officer regarding this 26 miles of priority sidewalk in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11598.128s">Madam</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11673.855s">So</a> as a committee, we really haven't gone down that avenue yet, but I won't speak to my colleagues, but I don't think we were opposed to doing it in-house versus outsourcing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11683.0s">We</a> were gonna leave that up to the administration, whatever you thought financially and from a, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11689.769s">a</a> standpoint of personnel made sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11691.95s">So</a> I just want to make sure that this is an important item. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11696.094s">And</a> the creation of an ordinance may assist us in clearing our sidewalks to a certain extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11701.678s">But</a> without the, you know, the input and the assistance from the city, I think we're never truly gonna get to a point where we see our sidewalks cleared off consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11714.347s">So</a> I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11716.349s">And</a> I am <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11718.151s">appreciative</a> of the fact that that's one of your two top priorities over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11723.975s">My</a> other question that I want to bring up, Mr. President, is regarding parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11730.32s">And</a> this has been an issue near and dear to me for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11733.182s">I</a> sat on the original Parking Enforcement Commission some years back that made the ultimate recommendations, of which 90% were not followed by that administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11745.672s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11746.218s">That's</a> an argument for another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11749.319s">But</a> Mr. President, we were told recently by the chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez, that come January 1st, the city was going to embark on taking parking enforcement in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11761.243s">And</a> I don't think that's incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11763.764s">If</a> I am, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11765.045s">But</a> I think that's what the administration is currently looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11768.466s">So</a> that is January 1st, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11772.247s">What</a> is outlined in the budget for parking <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11775.844s">somewhat</a> troubles me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11777.866s">And</a> the reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, is the existing or the existing contract with Park Method calls for the enforcement of only a certain percentage of our streets in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11794.3s">So</a> Park Method does not enforce the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11797.903s">I</a> would hope, Mr. President, moving forward, if we are going to <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11802.453s">move</a> forward with in-house parking, that we're looking at this as an entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11807.616s">It's</a> no longer going to be, we're just going to enforce resident permit parking streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11812.038s">We're</a> going to have to enforce every street in this community and provide the same enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11817.621s">The</a> current budget, Mr. President, calls for meeting the levels of park method that doesn't meet the requirements that I believe should meet by enforcing the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11832.487s">So</a> that being said, Mr. President, $350,601 may be what currently we can do to meet the level that Park Method is doing currently right now, but that's not the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11847.661s">And</a> when we talk about running a full-fledged department, which I hope that ultimately that's the goal, I realize it's not gonna start on day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11857.99s">I'm</a> not naive. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11859.258s">And</a> I realize there's a lot of working parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11861.578s">We</a> have to look at permanent parking, how we're going to approach that citywide or by district. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11866.339s">You</a> know, we have to look at a lot of things, Mr. President, but this current budget doesn't call for collections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11874.581s">So</a> you have three parking enforcement salaries and a head of parking enforcement, but you also need someone to collect. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11882.962s">So</a> if we end up going to double headed meters or stick with the kiosk, you need to have <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11888.903s">an</a> entity, a body that collects the revenue from these machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11893.044s">And</a> it can't be the person that's giving the ticket out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11896.345s">It</a> just doesn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11897.966s">So</a> you're talking about hiring potentially someone to do the collections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11901.967s">So</a> that's not currently part of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11905.268s">And</a> it's a crucial part of any parking enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11909.409s">Hearings,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11911.09s">Now,</a> currently right now, the first line of hearings is done by Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11915.811s">If</a> you're not happy with that, you're able to come to the city <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11918.586s">and</a> get a second hearing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11921.288s">Now</a> with Park Medford out of the way, you're gonna increase the number of hearings and we only have the one hearing person that's doing it on a stipend right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11932.135s">And</a> to me, that is not adequate enough with the influx of taking on the entire city and not just controlled streets, which Park Medford's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11942.101s">And</a> also the fact that Park Medford's hearings are gonna go away <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11946.319s">and</a> that's gonna be emphasized on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11950.401s">So</a> we don't have hearing offices other than the person that we have right now that's in a full-time job that's doing it on the side, which I think we all can appreciate, that's not gonna be enough for hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11962.786s">Maintenance,</a> Mr. President, any department, parking department worth their weight has a maintenance department that can fix machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11971.55s">I</a> mean, you go to any one of our kiosks, I was just at one on Salem Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11976.451s">In</a> front of the old burial, I was parked there to go to the chess tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11980.013s">I</a> went up to feed the machine, and it said out of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11983.794s">So</a> there are a number of machines, I'm sure, throughout the community that are out of service that we're going to inherit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11991.237s">And</a> whether or not we stick with that or not remains to be seen with the kiosks and meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11996.56s">I</a> think that's a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11998.34s">But</a> maintenance is not included in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12001.562s">Also,</a> Mr. President, when you call up Park Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12005.5s">they</a> have a staff of one of two people on staff there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12009.201s">So</a> at any given time, they have a staff person that picks up, they have another staff person that can look into issues, issue resident permit parking, issue all sorts of commuter parking stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12020.924s">So</a> you have at least one or two people in the office that'll handle that administrative role. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12026.386s">This</a> parking enforcement doesn't cover that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12029.847s">So</a> as you can see, as it's set up, and I know this is a work in progress, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12034.713s">This</a> is just a shell of a parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12038.094s">And</a> to have a full-fledged parking, I would venture to say that this budget would be either doubled or tripled in order to have a full-fledged parking program, which I think we all anticipate and expect in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12051.599s">So</a> those are the issues, Mr. President, that I wanted to bring up to the mayor that she's here now, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12057.521s">I</a> brought it up to the chief of staff, and I think he was in agreement that this is just the start of it, but again, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12064.731s">We</a> are doing the budget, and this will be implemented halfway through our budget period. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12070.514s">And</a> unless we have a pot of money somewhere else, there's gonna be a startup cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12075.957s">And</a> I wanna make sure if we implement this, that right away, we're not gonna get negativity saying, well, you put together a program, it doesn't provide this, this, and this, you're not doing my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12088.023s">We</a> don't want that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12090.044s">And</a> I think if we can avoid that angst in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12093.307s">I</a> think we have to make sure that, uh, you know, that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12096.529s">So</a> I don't know if the mayor wants to speak to that or just take that under advisement, but I have some grave concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12104.135s">So</a> if someone says to me, Hey Mike, we're set for pocket enforcement January. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12108.638s">I</a> have to say, well, it's being worked on, but according to the budget we passed, I don't believe there's enough money to create a full fledged parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12119.166s">So</a> that remains to be seen as the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12121.208s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12122.019s">I</a> don't know if the mayor wants to say anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12123.541s">I</a> don't wanna put her on the spot, but that's a concern I have with a portion of this budget, Mr. President, that I think we're all gonna vote for, but I don't have the utmost confidence that we're gonna provide that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12135.471s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12194.748s">The</a> reason why I say, Mr. President, you have one shot to make the first good impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12200.092s">And</a> I would hate to see the program desk, because I believe strongly we should have done in-house from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12206.597s">I</a> believe strongly we should have had double-headed meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12208.839s">I</a> believe strongly in a lot of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12211.205s">And</a> I just don't want to set us up for failure that we're providing not enough funds in the budget to really run a full-fledged program. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12219.427s">And</a> I don't want that to be the demise of this program, that people lose trust and faith in it if it's not rolled out appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12226.769s">I'd</a> actually rather see us wait to roll it out in order to get a full-fledged program. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12231.531s">So</a> I appreciate the comments from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12234.331s">Some</a> other just small issues, and I'll be brief, Mr. President, because I know my colleagues have other stuff to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12240.95s">road</a> in control. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12242.452s">Just</a> got a picture actually today from someone on the Fellsway that showed me a giant dead rat in their backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12249.998s">They</a> went out and bought their own pellets and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12253.181s">The</a> city actually came down and said, we can see nests, but they're in your neighbor's yard, they're in that neighbor's yard, and there's nothing we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12260.668s">This</a> council has requested <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12262.172s">that</a> we sign a waiver that the health department make up a waiver form that would allow the city to intervene and act when we do have a rodent issue that maybe residents can't afford to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12274.698s">Um,</a> and this is an issue, uh, it's a, it's a community issue and it's a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12279.86s">So</a> I don't think we could just put our head in the sand and say, well, it's on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12284.342s">The</a> city can't assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12285.763s">And,</a> uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12286.522s">The</a> amount of money in the budget for road and control citywide is 13,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12290.985s">Anyone</a> that's hired an exterminator knows they're not cheap. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12294.488s">And</a> when they come out to your house, you're talking three or 400 a whack for an exterminator. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12299.412s">And</a> that's on the low side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12300.913s">So</a> 13,000 citywide to address our concerns, I think is really appealing comparison of what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12308.719s">One</a> information on that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12342.968s">And</a> I appreciate that, Councilor Skoufis. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12345.021s">The</a> way I presented it was that we were gonna have this be an administrative policy, so a policy that falls under the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12353.367s">Not</a> everything needs to be enacted by legislation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12358.291s">So</a> that would be an administrative policy, but I think it would go a long way allowing the city to act and intervene on behalf of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12365.296s">So</a> I appreciate that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12366.977s">So</a> the road in control, Madam Mayor, just so you know, if there's money that can be moved around, we need to bait our catch basins, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12374.907s">We</a> need to do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12376.088s">I</a> can tell you the Wellington area is crawling with rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12379.851s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12381.352s">And</a> I've heard the same from the Heights and part of South Method and even in the Haines Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12386.376s">So</a> there's a problem throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12389.158s">And</a> I think we really need to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12393.102s">The</a> other issue I had, Mr. President, and I appreciate it was the planting of new trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12399.227s">The</a> administration decided to put 15,000, which I appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12404.552s">I</a> appreciate also the 25,000 added for stump removal, but I can just tell you in the 500 odd stumps that are throughout the community, that will tend to just a small, small percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12417.639s">Because</a> it's not just the grinding of stumps, it is the adding of new sidewalks, concrete, and everything else associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12425.362s">And</a> I don't think we're gonna get nearly close to getting level with these stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12433.247s">if</a> we don't put more money into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12434.508s">So</a> that I want to bring up, Mr. President, I don't think there's enough money for stump removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12439.772s">And</a> definitely, Mr. President, the repaving and repairing of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12443.775s">Chapter</a> 90 money, we put about $980,000 a year from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12448.318s">That</a> is through Chapter 90 money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12451.12s">The</a> mayor's capital plan calls for, and correct me if I'm wrong, 13 new streets being paved over a six year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12459.386s">We</a> have 719 odd streets in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12463.688s">13</a> over six years, we will never get ahead of the game if that's the game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12468.869s">And</a> that would be the avenue through a capital plan to address some of the major concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12475.31s">There</a> is little to no money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12478.511s">I</a> think I can state that there is zero money to repave in the budget and maybe some small money to fill potholes and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12487.113s">So</a> I don't think we're aggressive enough in tackling one of the major issues we all hear, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12493.23s">is</a> the poor condition, and you hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12495.09s">And</a> these conditions, this is not a target at anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12498.031s">These</a> conditions have existed for 20, 30 years in our community, but we have to have a systematic way of addressing it, and I don't think we're quite there yet, so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12575.154s">And</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12579.073s">And</a> just, you know, putting forth some of the highlights, the election coordinator position, originally in the budget, it was only for a part-time position, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12589.679s">I</a> think behind this rail, we all can appreciate the importance of having a full-time election coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12596.322s">Every</a> year we have a major election in this city, and the integrity of our election has to be at the top of the priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12603.766s">Without</a> the confidence in our election process and how we hire our elected officials, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12608.767s">and</a> how we look at the city charter, which governs how we operate as a community, I think, you know, you couldn't have the confidence and trust in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12617.754s">So</a> that's a vital role. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12619.295s">I'm</a> happy to see that the mayor saw fit to extend that from a part-time position at the request of this council to a full-time position, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12629.482s">The</a> staff does a great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12630.983s">The</a> people that are currently in their roles, in my opinion, do a great work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12636.35s">And</a> we're at 41,000 registered voters now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12639.392s">That</a> number has increased over the years dramatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12642.395s">So</a> we have more registered voters in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12646.878s">We</a> have more options and ways of people voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12650.06s">We</a> have extended voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12651.261s">We</a> have absentee ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12653.022s">We</a> have early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12654.904s">We</a> have a lot going on now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12657.366s">And</a> we want to maintain the integrity of that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12659.947s">The</a> city clerk does a great job, but he's one person and he wears many hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12664.071s">And</a> this coordinator position, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12666.435s">It's</a> worth its weight in gold and I appreciate the mayor saw fit to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12670.519s">Uh,</a> the director of parking is going to be a vital role as the president and the facilities manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12676.025s">I</a> know this council has called for it in particular council Scarpelli has been talking about a road crew for sidewalks and streets, but in particular, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12683.78s">facilities</a> manager for the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12686.842s">And</a> finally, we're seeing that position in the budget, which will draw light to every building in this community, that there's a maintenance plan, there's someone overseeing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12698.569s">And</a> I think, again, it's going to pay in the long run, because we're not going to be throwing money into buildings that with proper maintenance, we're not going to see all this need for additional work later down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12713.851s">So</a> it'll end up being a cost savings in the long run, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12719.073s">I'm</a> going to stop for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12720.073s">There</a> was a number of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12722.234s">Mr.</a> President, you're giving me the hairy eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12733.438s">And</a> I appreciate my colleagues, but this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12736.84s">It's</a> $191 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12738.5s">I</a> just want to make sure that at least all my concerns and my colleagues are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12743.106s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14206.489s">He</a> is of community service to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14211.43s">You</a> know, many of us know <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14213.57s">uh,</a> Knights of Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14215.291s">They've</a> been very active in this community, assisting the most needy, establishing funds for food pantries around not only method, but the surrounding communities, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14227.434s">And</a> I want to thank the members of the Knights of Columbus for their commitment to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14232.835s">And</a> I want to thank in particular Commander William Knight, who has led the Knights of Columbus for the past year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14241.058s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14242.149s">tell</a> them to keep up the good work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14244.01s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_k3Xg1illaRI/2024-11-19_k3Xg1illaRI.html">City Council 06-23-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=58.927s">Motion</a> for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=73.535s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=76.936s">Is</a> the mic on, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=79.558s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=80.038s">Can</a> you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=81.519s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=238.614s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=241.837s">We're</a> not discussing any names, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=245.84s">We're</a> having this meeting to sit down and talk to our city solicitor, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=301.866s">I</a> don't understand why the city council can never meet an executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=305.327s">But</a> the school committee every other week can, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=308.008s">It</a> makes zero sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=309.748s">And</a> why we can't discuss an executive session without returning an issue, Mr. President, which makes zero sense to me, too, and maybe cries out for the fact that this council needs to have a line item in the budget to have representation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=324.692s">for</a> exact issues like we're experiencing right now, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=656.01s">So</a> Mr. President, if I could, then I was under the impression like when we had our emergency meeting on Saturday, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=664.035s">That</a> meeting was for the sole purpose of discussing scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=669.337s">And</a> we had a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=670.197s">We</a> discussed potential scheduling, which led to tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=673.638s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=674.238s">I</a> was on the impression tonight we were going to get some guidance from the city solicitor about potential next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=681.936s">And</a> that's all we were going to discuss, potential next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=685.998s">Now,</a> knowing what we hear tonight, Mr. President, I don't feel comfortable being in a room with other parties, Mr. President, without having representation, legal representation on behalf of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=698.346s">So</a> I would ask that whatever meaning we do have, that we invite legal counsel <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=704.622s">outside</a> legal counsel to the meeting to represent the method City Council, Mr. President, because I'm sure other parties and entities probably have their own legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=714.915s">Uh,</a> and that is, uh, so I was hoping tonight we would get that, uh, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=721.303s">go</a> ahead from the city solicitor to go ahead to whatever we feel comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=726.925s">Without</a> discussing allegations, without discussing names, without violating anyone's rights, Mr. President, because this council is not in the business of violating rights, but we are in the business, Mr. President, where we're presented with allegations to make sure we take them seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=743.15s">And</a> I think that's what we're trying to do as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=746.251s">But</a> if my hands are tied that we can't meet, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=750.102s">without</a> I don't understand why a body, a legislative body that's elected by the people can't meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=756.264s">And</a> I understand the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=758.064s">Believe</a> me, can't meet to discuss with our attorney, Mr. President, next steps that the council will take. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=765.286s">I</a> don't understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=766.806s">And</a> I still can't fathom why we can't do that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=785.339s">No,</a> when did we ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=786.46s">We</a> asked Saturday for this meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=790.18s">When</a> did we ask?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=793.981s">Because</a> the same solicitor said- So it's been, with all due respect, two to three days, and now we're hearing that we really shouldn't be meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=918.661s">I</a> know we have the ability because we've done it in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=924.423s">I</a> was hoping to get guidance as the first step tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1023.777s">48</a> hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1024.638s">520</a> Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1027.921s">So</a> how do we do that and have legal counsel representing us?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1051.298s">But</a> there may be other legal counsel there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1053.979s">So</a> we won't have any representation, and other parties may have legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1058.68s">And</a> I don't feel comfortable being in a room <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1060.68s">without</a> having our own legal counsel.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1074.025s">I</a> don't know why we have to have outside parties in a vote for us to have legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1079.167s">Why</a> do we have to have outside parties? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1080.907s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1081.508s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1081.748s">Why</a> can't this be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1083.108s">Mr.</a> President, can we do it just on the floor today? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1086.109s">If</a> you want to do it on the floor on <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1088.617s">or</a> maybe you can ask the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1091.238s">Is</a> that something that we can do just on the floor today requesting outside legal counsel?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1099.879s">We</a> don't make appropriations, so that would be up to the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1103.32s">So,</a> um, you know, maybe that's the direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1107.941s">I</a> just don't feel comfortable being here with parties that would not <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1112.896s">at</a> liberty to discuss anything right now, and having them have legal counsel and us not having any legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1120.22s">Because</a> it's going to get to be a very legal process, I assume.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1127.763s">That's</a> what I was hoping tonight we were going to get, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1130.445s">That's</a> what I was hoping tonight was going to happen.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1139.549s">Yeah,</a> but that doesn't help us with an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1142.002s">Right,</a> that helps us not violate the open meeting law, but.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1153.688s">Right,</a> well, I thought we were going through that process.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1318.116s">Mr.</a> President, are you able to outline for what purpose this private investigators being hired?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1327.724s">are</a> you able to? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1328.965s">Are</a> you able to outline that now before us?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1334.748s">So</a> we don't know what's being investigated. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1337.35s">We</a> don't know to what extent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1339.171s">Eso</a> I think that's why, you know, we have to do our due diligence as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1344.494s">Um,</a> you know, and there could be, uh, on multiple ongoing investigations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1350.798s">But</a> I don't feel comfortable with that response, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1355.075s">Because</a> I'm not sure what the response involves. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1358.617s">And</a> were the parties notified about this meeting that was held? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1363.299s">Do</a> they have the same rights to show up at City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1367.221s">The</a> two department heads, were they notified? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1369.262s">Were</a> they privy to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1369.862s">Excuse</a> me, Councilman Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1377.986s">Do</a> they fall under the same requirements?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1381.827s">The</a> parties that are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1383.865s">were</a> they notified of, I'm sorry, of whatever meeting took place with the city administration regarding the hiring of an investigator with the, uh, it wasn't a meeting though.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1397.756s">It</a> didn't just happen in the hallway, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1399.698s">It</a> was a meeting called meeting and more of a request.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1406.323s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1406.683s">Well,</a> Mr. President, at this point, I think we should proceed as we were going to proceed.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1413.737s">That</a> would be my recommendation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1436.089s">So</a> Mr. President, if I could, considering our next discussion is regarding the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1443.758s">Do</a> we have to notify anyone regarding a request, a formal request by the council for legal council appropriation? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1455.741s">Or</a> can we just, as part of the budget discussion, include that into the budget discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1461.322s">Because</a> when we offer motions on the budget, they're not posted in advance, naturally.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1477.76s">Okay,</a> well, that may be.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1500.418s">This</a> is a legislative budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1501.62s">Unless</a> we create a legal line item for a council legal representation, which we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1507.63s">And</a> one doesn't currently exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1509.453s">And</a> what we were told is something that we can do as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1513.82s">We</a> have that authority.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1981.132s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1982.13s">So,</a> I mean... Let's go into executive session on Friday.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2102.674s">Just</a> one question for the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2105.455s">Would</a> there be any prohibition for the council <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2108.703s">to</a> bring on free legal counsel? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2111.105s">Like</a> if we found an attorney that wanted to represent us without going through a process of asking for an allocation from the mayor, would there be anything that would preclude us from doing that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2128.159s">To</a> find a pro bono attorney, you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2131.241s">You</a> were just saying that we have the ability to bring on an attorney, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2137.478s">Right,</a> so this is not reflective upon you, it's reflective upon us bringing someone on. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2142.68s">And</a> if the appropriation doesn't come in a timely fashion, then it doesn't suit its purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2149.762s">So</a> I would say if we're able to bring on free legal counsel to advise us, right, Mr. President, at the beginning, in particular for this Friday meeting, I don't see any harm in having legal counsel there to represent this council, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2183.944s">More</a> or less.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2389.619s">I</a> do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2390.42s">Just</a> a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2391.14s">Uh,</a> when Kim, when you mentioned about giving ample notice, um, to the parties involved, who does that include?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2407.809s">So</a> who would that be? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2409.03s">In</a> this case, the individuals discussed.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2417.147s">So</a> we don't even know who we're talking about then. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2420.608s">I</a> mean, no, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2421.828s">We're</a> in a meeting where we can't discuss names. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2424.209s">We</a> can't discuss anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2425.729s">So</a> if the parties wanted to waive their rights, they have the ability to do so, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2433.49s">And</a> would it be parties that brought the claim or would it be parties where?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2446.73s">all</a> individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2448.331s">So</a> you couldn't have certain members waive their rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2452.833s">For</a> instance, if the two department heads said, I want to waive my rights and the council has the ability to speak whatever you want to speak, that wouldn't be enough for the open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2463.618s">There</a> would still be a violation of the open meeting because the city administration didn't waive their rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2476.066s">Do</a> you know what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2476.946s">There's</a> two sides, one side saying we waive our rights, we have to get the other side naturally to waive their rights, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2505.843s">Right,</a> because there's multiple parties here, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2512.665s">Multiple</a> individuals.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2514.806s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2515.926s">So</a> if some of them waived their rights and said, we have no problem with the council bringing this up, you know, we don't want to be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2522.969s">We</a> have no problem with them discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2525.71s">That</a> doesn't suffice because we need everyone to waive their rights.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2541.204s">Okay,</a> I'm just, okay, Mr. Pratt. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2543.586s">I'm</a> fine moving forward with the exec on Friday and the amendments that Councilor Bears put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2548.469s">I'm</a> fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2549.509s">So</a> you wanna make, Councilor Morell.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2684.942s">I</a> think that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2687.684s">That's</a> not what Kim said. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2689.145s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2689.885s">That's</a> what you said, but it's not what Kim said. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2691.987s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2694.108s">He's</a> saying as long as we notice people, it doesn't matter if they show up or not, as long as we notice.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2717.464s">Absolutely,</a> but I'm just trying to figure out if we can't discuss them, then why are we having the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2724.7s">Right,</a> I mean.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2743.805s">We</a> have one.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2746.306s">No,</a> no, no, it's not upon you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2748.866s">We</a> need someone to give us guidance and I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2752.957s">So</a> no, it could be the same person.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2838.535s">The</a> motion that I put forward was to meet in exact on Friday at 6.30, I believe, depending on the time now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2847.461s">With</a> the amendments made by Councilor, three amendments, I believe he put forth.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2967.359s">Uh,</a> here and on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2974.883s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2975.544s">Uh,</a> who would like to speak?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3119.053s">Mr.</a> President, just to clarify, if we could, even if we wanted to discuss this in an open meeting, I think the city solicitor said all parties had to agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3129.702s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3135.871s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3136.251s">So,</a> so even though some of the parties are waiving their rights, Mr. President, I believe all parties have to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3144.017s">That's</a> 48 hour notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3145.118s">So,</a> um, that's going to preclude us from discussing this at a public session. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3153.745s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3153.965s">I</a> shouldn't.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3253.658s">Mr.</a> President, as I stated, we don't know the scope of the investigation either. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3257.539s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3258.139s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3258.359s">So</a> we know there's an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3261.4s">We</a> don't know to what extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3263.861s">And</a> I think that should be something that, you know, we're made aware of, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3410.273s">Motion</a> to adjourn, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_SOB2SCGe10A/2024-11-19_SOB2SCGe10A.html">City Council 06-22-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=412.13s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=414.311s">I</a> was contacted recently by a local resident that was very interested in obtaining a second meter for outdoor activities, water meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=428.597s">And</a> after doing a little research, Mr. President, it was found out that only those that have an underground irrigation system <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=440.613s">are</a> allowed to benefit from the second meter, which does not add on the added cost for a sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=449.197s">And</a> after looking at the actual application and reading the application, it seems to me <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=458.129s">the</a> requirements by the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=462.131s">Tonight,</a> I'm going to respectfully ask that the Water and Sewer Commissioners meet again, Mr. President, to discuss opening up the second water meter to all residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=476.056s">This</a> irrigation program was established in 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=479.897s">And</a> the first phase was to open it up to residential water meters <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=487.619s">strictly</a> for underground irrigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=491.361s">And</a> at the time, it was stated, Mr. President, that this was going to be phase one of the program back in 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=500.146s">And</a> here we are 11 years later, and there's never been another phase rolled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=506.289s">So</a> if you're a commercial property in the community, you are currently not eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=511.992s">And</a> if you are a property owner, that doesn't happen to have, like my property, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=516.618s">I</a> don't have an underground irrigation system, but I do use a hose. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=520.901s">And</a> sometimes I may do it by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=523.722s">Sometimes</a> I may put out one of those little devices that sprinkles water around. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=528.305s">And</a> like many of us, some people water their garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=534.349s">Some</a> people fill their pool up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=536.93s">And</a> to me, the same principle applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=540.833s">If</a> that water is not finding its way back into the sewer system, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=545.828s">Then,</a> you know, the whole idea of setting this up was to give taxpayers a relief, a rate relief from using water outside of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=557.615s">And</a> the whole intent was to provide that relief to those who do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=563.7s">And</a> I think expanding the program after 11 years, I think we have a good handle on how many people have taken advantage of this program and look at the metrics regarding how this is working out, what has been the cost, because there is a cost not only to the resident, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=581.454s">that's</a> putting in a second meter, but there's also a cost to those who pay water and sewer in the community, because as we all know, Mr. President, when the water comes into the community, it's meted. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=593.322s">So</a> there's giant meters that show how much water is coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=596.064s">The</a> MWRA assesses us through what's coming into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=601.168s">So</a> they don't look and say, well, you're using the water outside, using it inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=605.911s">The</a> MWRA doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=607.972s">The</a> city of Medford created that program which allows us to give people, if you want to call it a reduction or abatement, on the sewer for consumption outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=618.258s">And</a> so there is a cost to all of us regarding this meter program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=624.621s">But</a> I think this program, Mr. President, in all honesty, should be expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=629.143s">Because</a> to me, we should be looking at just people that have an underground irrigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=634.346s">we</a> should be looking at anyone that uses outside water. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=638.488s">And</a> what I would like to do, Mr. President, I have a copy of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=643.611s">A</a> lot of residents aren't even familiar that there's a program that exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=648.253s">But</a> there's an irrigation meter application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=650.895s">The</a> fee is $300 to fill out this fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=654.957s">And</a> then it goes on to give you the guidelines for the residential irrigation installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=663.524s">And</a> just for edification, Mr. President, I think people should be aware if they are interested, the city allows irrigation meters on in-ground irrigation systems for residential accounts only. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=675.973s">Applications</a> are taken in order they are received and will be handled by the water division at their discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=682.711s">All</a> applicants must pass a pre-installation inspection and follow the guidelines for basic residential irrigation meter installation and requirements as stated on the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=695.754s">So</a> as you can see from this particular guideline, you have to have an underground irrigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=704.755s">The</a> first requirement is a licensed plumber must obtain a permit <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=709.424s">at</a> the building department in order to install this meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=713.587s">So</a> you can't install it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=716.109s">A</a> certified and tested backflow device must be furnished at the customer's expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=722.334s">Customers</a> must maintain the backflow prevention assembly on the irrigation system <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=727.38s">to</a> ensure protection of the portable water supply with yearly inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=732.243s">Backflow</a> tests are conducted by the engineering division, and the current fee for inspection is $60 annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=739.967s">So</a> there's a $300 charge for the meter itself, and then there's a $60 annual charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=747.452s">So</a> if you don't use a lot of outside water, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=751.574s">depending</a> on what you're using, it may not be worthwhile from a financial standpoint to partake in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=758.279s">So</a> you really have to sit down and figure out how much watering you're doing outside in order if this makes financial sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=766.504s">All</a> irrigation systems must comply with all local and state landscape irrigation regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=772.308s">All</a> pipes from the service through the irrigation meter <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=775.948s">and</a> three feet past the backflow preventer must be brass or copper material. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=781.171s">No</a> plastic galvanized or cast iron pipes are allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=785.473s">New</a> and existing dwellings may split the service connection for irrigation with backflow device that has a T or a Y split to separate domestic and irrigation water. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=799.015s">The</a> city of Medford metering division is not responsible for pressure loss or consumption and volume issues resulting from the split connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=807.0s">The</a> meter and the reading device are issued by the city and the price is included in the application fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=814.846s">All</a> pipes from the irrigation meter must be inspected to ensure that there are no cross connections between domestic and irrigation lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=823.932s">You</a> must install shut off valves before and after the new irrigation meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=829.387s">So</a> that's pretty much what the rules and regulations are, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=832.789s">I</a> would respectfully ask on behalf of the many hundreds, if not thousands of residents that water their lawn, that tend to their gardens, that fill their pool, and use a hose outside for a number of different reasons, that I respectfully ask the Water and Sewer Commission to expand the program currently to all residents <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=855.68s">if</a> need be, Mr. President, and also go into phase two, which would allow for the commercial application of outside irrigation as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=867.008s">So</a> I respectfully put that in the form of a motion, and I thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=923.261s">Mr.</a> President, I'm not opposed to looking at that and amending the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=927.221s">So</a> I would respectfully add that in addition to my motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=931.002s">that</a> the Water and Sewer Commissioners look at the city of Revere and how they use an outside meter for residents that does not incur the cost of hiring a plumber, as well as other associated costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=945.974s">So</a> I appreciate that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=991.078s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=992.719s">I</a> rise today with all due respect and honor for one of methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=997.261s">Finest</a> Brian Cronin for anyone that knows Brian has served this city with distinction for 42 years, Mr. President, over four decades of an impeccable record, uh, protecting the life and property of our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1014.827s">You</a> couldn't meet a kinder, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1017.066s">gentle</a> a person, Mr. President, everyone that I've spoken to that it has seen this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1023.097s">Uh,</a> the first words out of their mouth were we're sad to see such a man of character leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1030.578s">And</a> I'm hoping, Mr. President, that he comes back in other capacities. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1035.741s">We</a> were just talking about, and I didn't mention this to Brian, but we were just talking about emergency preparedness and how that position for a number of years has been somewhat of a stipend side position that's gone unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1051.988s">And</a> it's such an important role in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1054.529s">And</a> respectfully, I'd love to see Brian come back as the emergency preparedness <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1061.159s">head</a> in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1063.14s">But</a> with that

was resuscitated with a bag valve mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1244.217s">With</a> paramedics now on the scene, this was accomplished with the umbilical cord still attached, with all personnel working in very close quarters, and the second baby beginning to crown. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1257.282s">After</a> several minutes of manual restitution, the baby began to

particular, Mr. President, the Deputy Captain of Operations, Deputy Chief Brian Cronin, who is not only a firefighter, Mr. President, he is a close friend to many. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1435.776s">and</a> he's gonna be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1438.178s">His</a> professionalism, the way he carried himself, the way he made every firefighter, no matter what position he served, all the way up to deputy chief, Mr. President, he made every firefighter, whether you're on the job for one day or on it for 40 years, like himself, he respected and made them all feel welcome and at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1461.584s">And</a> truly, it's firefighters like Brian Cronin that make the family of firefighters what they are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1468.688s">And</a> I would ask that on behalf of this council, that we honor Brian by giving Brian a council

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1750.616s">I</a> want to say it's at the end of this month, but I don't have the exact date.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1832.213s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1834.074s">Anyone</a> that knows the INS of family know them as outstanding method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1839.959s">Mr.</a> President, a family that's been involved in this community for decades, giving of themselves at all different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1849.226s">Mr.</a> President, Maria has been a tremendous business owner in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1854.69s">giving</a> back at many, many events. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1857.752s">She</a> is the first to step forward and make donations when necessary or when asked to, uh, go over and above the call of duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1866.837s">Maria,</a> INS is the first to volunteer, Mr. President, and I think that comes from her parents and the way she was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1875.202s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, I also believe she's a proud vocational. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1880.386s">I</a> believe she went to the cosmetology <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1883.368s">at</a> the method vocational technical high school, Mr. President, where she learned her craft and it's evident in the type of business that she runs and the product that she puts out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1897.499s">Mr.</a> President, anyone that comes out of there is coming out with a hairstyle that is second to none. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1904.644s">Um,</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1905.855s">I</a> just want to congratulate her on her 15 years and wish her another 50 years of success in our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2733.023s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2733.724s">I</a> want to thank President Caraviello for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2739.45s">I</a> come from a little different train of thought, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2743.193s">These</a> are method streets and the fact that it may be a private way, in my opinion, has zero bearing on the responsibility of the city <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2758.59s">to</a> make sure public nuisance and public safety issues are not addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2764.331s">I</a> think it's a cop-out to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2769.192s">40%</a> of our 719 streets in this community are private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2774.413s">So</a> what are we saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2775.214s">40%</a> of our streets we can't enforce on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2779.895s">It's</a> ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2782.795s">And</a> I've been talking about this issue for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2784.936s">No</a> one wants to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2787.19s">But</a> it is an issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2789.172s">And</a> as far as I'm concerned, if I was the CEO, which would have happened where there would have been signs posted all in those streets stating resident only. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2802.415s">And</a> I would have had the tow trucks out there and the cops out there ticketing immediately and worry about it after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2810.283s">Because</a> what we're doing is providing parking for people that want to use the DCR land. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2816.97s">So</a> we essentially become the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2820.734s">DCR's</a> not providing parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2822.936s">We</a> are. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2825.449s">And</a> it's a cop-out to say, well, it's a private road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2829.251s">What</a> benefit? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2830.091s">Ask</a> any of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2831.272s">What</a> benefit do you have living on a private road? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2835.213s">You</a> have zero benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2836.854s">You</a> pay the same tax as everyone else, and you get zero benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2841.636s">So</a> if they're unable to give tickets on a private road, why are we plowing? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2846.818s">That's</a> city money. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2847.999s">That's</a> city resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2849.66s">We're</a> allowed to plow? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2852.961s">To</a> me, that has zero bearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2855.662s">And</a> if there was leadership in the community, they would have acted immediately, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2861.125s">And</a> it's no different as what's happening at the top of Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2865.768s">It's</a> no difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2867.789s">And</a> really, it upsets me because I think the city should be the first to step up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2872.832s">Worry</a> about the consequences after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2876.694s">Send</a> a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2877.615s">We're</a> not going to tolerate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2880.036s">We're</a> not going to allow you to invade our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2883.597s">We're</a> not going to allow you to have cookouts in front of someone's home and leave debris behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2888.638s">We're</a> not going to allow you to change out of your bathing suit in front of our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2894.259s">We're</a> not going to allow public drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2898.0s">That's</a> the message that has to be sent, not that we're worried if we give a ticket out because, oh, it's a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2904.601s">That's</a> baloney. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2905.781s">That's</a> absolute baloney. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2908.462s">And</a> to hide behind that, Mr. President, is shirking your duties, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2915.723s">These</a> residents, they're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2916.885s">They've</a> been going through this for years, for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2920.73s">And</a> if it takes an ordinance change, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2922.772s">I</a> don't know if that's going to do it all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2925.696s">We</a> have a serious issue with over the years, over the last 50, 60, 70 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2931.593s">when</a> this city was being built up and so forth, that the city at the time allowed them to make private ways, Mr. President, because they didn't want to go through the acceptance process to accept a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2943.603s">And</a> it was done for a number of reasons, because some of these streets, Mr. President, didn't have the proper infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2949.668s">You</a> go up the heights, a lot of them didn't have the proper drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2954.81s">and</a> they tapped into the sewer system where they shouldn't have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2958.273s">So</a> a lot of these roads were created as paper roads and private ways because the city wasn't, for years, didn't really follow through on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2969.083s">There's</a> no reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2970.765s">If</a> a road still wants to be a private way, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2973.607s">But</a> we should send out a survey to everyone on private ways right now and ask them, would you like to change over? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2980.553s">And</a> for those that want to change over, we should move immediately to change over, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2985.281s">There's</a> a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2986.423s">For</a> those that want to keep it private, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2991.395s">But</a> everyone should be receiving the same city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2994.737s">You</a> pay the same taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2996.379s">And</a> police enforcement is a city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2999.08s">Plowing</a> is a city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3000.662s">Your</a> sidewalk being done is a city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3002.763s">Your</a> tree being trimmed is a city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3005.225s">And</a> there's no reason why 269 roads, which are thousands of homes and tens of thousands of residents, have to say, well, I live on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3015.512s">I'm</a> not entitled to the same enforcement or the same upkeep on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3020.015s">It's</a> ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3021.276s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3023.797s">So</a> I support the president, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3027.378s">I</a> would ask that immediately enforcement take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3032.701s">And</a> I know that request already happened through a neighborhood meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3035.782s">And</a> I guess those saw, those wooden saw horses were broken in half and people tossed them aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3042.124s">But</a> we need true enforcement there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3044.025s">And</a> if we need to station someone there, Mr. President, have a police officer stationed in that area, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3053.208s">then</a> so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3054.068s">This</a> is not Mayberry. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3056.269s">It's</a> a city of 60,000 people, seven square miles, $190 million budget, and we can't tell residents that are paying tens of thousands of dollars in taxes, sorry, you live on a private website. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3071.536s">We'd</a> love to help you out, but we can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3073.857s">You're</a> on a private road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3076.118s">Unacceptable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3077.058s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, for bringing this issue up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3207.604s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3209.106s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3210.266s">So</a> we have outside construction companies come into our community, post their own little handmade signs all over the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3217.551s">No</a> parking or you'll be towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3219.533s">But</a> the city of Medford can't do that to help residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3223.84s">It</a> makes no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3226.241s">We</a> allow outside utility companies to come in and invade our city and post these signs, but we can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3234.166s">That</a> should happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3236.207s">I</a> agree with you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3237.347s">That</a> should happen overnight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3239.889s">It</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3241.91s">We</a> really need answers on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3244.695s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4759.751s">Move</a> suspension of the rules to take public participation, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6085.527s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6086.548s">I</a> wanna thank the speakers tonight because I believe this council has tried to act over the last year to be a sounding board for residents that <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6097.468s">felt</a> that their voice wasn't being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6100.75s">And,</a> you know, we may have not had the ability to make substantive changes, but I think we did act as a sounding board for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6112.017s">I</a> would like to say that I don't believe any body, whether it's the city council, the mayor's office, or the school committee, has the sole authority, Mr. President, over city-owned buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6126.805s">I</a> do believe that the school committee had the authority to rename the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6132.809s">However,</a> I don't think there's anything that would prevent us as a city council, which is the legislative body, to put an ordinance in place that would require a check and balance on the naming of any building within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6147.552s">So</a> at some point, Mr. President, I would like to offer that as a motion, and I'll do it here tonight if need be, that we request the city solicitor, Kim Scanlon, to look at whether we as a legislative body, the Medford City Council, through a city ordinance can require that we as a legislative body elected by the people would also have a say <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6175.612s">and</a> the renaming of any building, whether it's municipal or school building, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6181.553s">And</a> that way, there would be a check and balance in that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6185.394s">As</a> we all know, the school committee doesn't even have the authority to appropriate funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6190.976s">And</a> these buildings are city-owned buildings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6194.677s">And</a> I think we require closer scrutiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6198.798s">So</a> I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we ask the city solicitor whether we can do that via an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6205.7s">I</a> also think when we talk, Mr. President, about this community and about the division over the last couple of years, it's important that we as a community, I think, call out hatred whenever we see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6221.251s">I</a> mean, hatred can't be one side or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6225.734s">Hatred</a> is hatred, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6228.236s">So</a> what gets me is, you know, someone will say, well, you didn't call out this hatred or that hatred. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6233.419s">I</a> think we all stand <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6235.39s">and</a> I won't speak for anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6237.731s">We</a> can't, as a community, tolerate hatred, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6241.872s">Any</a> type of hatred. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6243.552s">And</a> I think, as a community, what really divides us, Mr. President, and I have to bring it up, and, you know, when you have people on social media, and God bless people that want to use social media, I'm not on it, Mr. President, and it's intentional. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6260.237s">I</a> think it's the demise of society, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6264.372s">For</a> those that want to get on social media, Mr. President, I think they have to be careful on the words that they use. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6271.758s">Because</a> if your intent is to get your point across, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6275.742s">If</a> your intent is to continue to divide, I think you have to be called out on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6282.687s">Because</a> this is far too good of a community to let that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6287.211s">And</a> there's one email, Mr. President, that went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6291.295s">Actually,</a> it was social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6292.135s">It</a> wasn't an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6293.572s">and</a> it was a call for action right before the Columbus School vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6298.734s">I</a> won't mention the person's name, although that person didn't mind throwing everyone else in the community under the bus, but that's fine, if that's the way they want to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6310.399s">But</a> we as a community, Mr. President, someday this may be you that they're targeting, someday it may be your group, someday it may be your ancestry, someday it may be your religion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6322.506s">And</a> the list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6325.407s">I've</a> always stated as an elected official, just because you have the ability and the power to do something doesn't mean it's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6334.151s">And</a> I've been saying that for decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6337.573s">And</a> here's a perfect example of a school committee that had the ability, had the power to flex their muscle, and they did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6346.857s">Didn't</a> matter anything else, they did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6348.717s">They</a> flexed their muscle. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6350.792s">And</a> in my opinion, those are not true leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6353.953s">Because</a> a true leader will listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6355.693s">A</a> true leader will deliberate. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6357.194s">And</a> they'll take into consideration, Mr. President, everyone's feelings and factors, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6363.215s">And</a> that truly did not happen with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6365.696s">And</a> I think it's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6366.896s">And</a> it's why it polarized our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6372.158s">But</a> I do, Mr. President, want to read this hateful, hateful posting that went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6379.02s">And</a> I'm sure there are a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6380.57s">But</a> this one really hit home with me, and it was a call right before the meeting for the Columbus School vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6387.333s">This</a> is a call to action. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6389.613s">The</a> final voting on the new name for the Columbus School is happening on Monday night during a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6395.996s">The</a> meeting starts at 6.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6397.256s">There</a> will be public participation permitted, and the right wing of Method is organizing around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6405.879s">The</a> worst of the worst will be there in force. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6410.796s">and</a> they are defending nothing less than white supremacy in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6416.961s">The</a> groups that have been energized by this are using the Trump playbook and creating completely false narratives about what happened in the process of how the name change is being handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6431.093s">We</a> need bodies at this event in person, and we need faces on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6437.378s">Fear</a> warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6438.795s">The</a> people who are going to speak are the most racist, cruel, hateful humans in method. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6446.862s">And</a> this action will be painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6450.845s">Mr.</a> President, I was president at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6456.349s">There</a> were many, many residents present on Zoom, Mr. President, and at the meeting that took time to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6464.476s">There</a> were many people in this community that had strong feelings <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6469.038s">about</a> the renaming of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6471.039s">And</a> we're all entitled to our feelings and our opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6474.76s">Take</a> that away, what do we have as a society? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6479.421s">And</a> to be told that you may have an opinion that differs from someone else, that you're hateful, that you're a racist, that you're a white supremacist for showing up, is a disgrace, Mr. President, an absolute disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6496.378s">And</a> it's an intimidation, nothing more than an intimidation to have people say, you know what, if I show up to that meeting and speak my mind, I'm going to be lumped into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6507.803s">And</a> we can't allow, as a community, no matter what side you are on the issue, because someday, Mr. President, you're going to be on the opposite side. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6519.308s">You</a> may be the one they're targeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6522.209s">As</a> a community, you would hope we all stand together <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6526.339s">and</a> we're able to decipher what's right and wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6529.961s">Put</a> everything aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6531.522s">We're</a> all humans. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6532.602s">What's</a> right and wrong, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6536.244s">And</a> calling people out because they have an opinion or trying to label them in the worst way, Mr. President, calling them white supremacy, calling them hateful, the worst possible thing you can call someone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6552.513s">And</a> for the most part, it's untrue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6557.949s">So</a> that really bothered me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6559.97s">When</a> I read that, Mr. President, I've been elected a lot of years, and that language alone really bothered me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6566.775s">I</a> know there's a lot of language going back and forth, but that language resonated with me because, Mr. President, it's not who we are as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6578.403s">Get</a> to know the community that you moved into. <a

on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6588.387s">Listen</a> to what people have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6590.588s">Don't</a> be quick to judge and react or pay people in a corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6595.371s">Or</a> you're a righty, you're a lefty, you're this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6598.113s">That's</a> hard law. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6602.455s">We</a> all live in this city because we love it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6605.537s">And</a> if you don't love it, you know where the door is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6609.219s">See</a> you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6612.821s">Because</a> we're not going to tolerate hate, Mr. President, in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6616.998s">I</a> hate to see all these stop hatred signs all around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6622.339s">People</a> put them out because they feel strongly about it, Mr. President, but that's not who we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6628.36s">Do</a> we need to work on things? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6629.961s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6631.281s">It'd</a> be naive to say otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6633.702s">Are</a> there changes we can make as a community? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6635.582s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6636.322s">And</a> I think we're all willing to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6638.883s">We</a> all want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6641.565s">But</a> we're not going to get there through a vehicle of intimidation and harassment and name calling. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6647.106s">We're</a> not going to get there, and we'll never get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6649.866s">And</a> if people think we're going to get there by browbeating people and calling them names, then they're misunderstood, Mr. President, because it's not going to happen in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6662.329s">We're</a> too good of a community, and we're going to rally around this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6689.736s">I</a> understand that Mr. President I'm fine with that just if you could just read back the motion or I'll state it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6699.71s">Well,</a> just so for the edification of the people watching now, the wording is that I request that we ask the city solicitor for a ruling, Mr. President, whether or not the city council through way of a formal city ordinance can craft the process of the naming of any municipal or school building <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=6729.678s">So</a> any facility, municipal school building, Mr. President, and whether we can do that by way of ordinance.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7213.268s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7213.949s">Council</a> Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7215.429s">Alicia,</a> do you know how much money we currently have in the historic preservation?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7246.483s">So</a> after this appropriation, we'll have 374, 640 or 378, 640 around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7254.165s">Around</a> there, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7259.167s">The</a> reason why I asked Mr. President is when we just met with the fire chief to discuss the fire department budget, it was mentioned to us that some of the capital plans, as well as some of the narrative from the <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7274.932s">report</a> that was just commissioned by the mayor to look at our fire stations spoke about using CPC funds from historic preservation in order to fund some of the renovations of our fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7289.904s">And</a> I just want to make sure that the city administration and I won't put Alicia on the spot, but I want to make sure that these funds that are out there that I'm sure they're going to go fast, that this is one of <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7303.545s">the</a> areas that they were looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7305.407s">And</a> I believe the city administration, Alicia, I'm not sure if you're familiar or not, but did receive correspondence back from the historic commission stating that indeed, fire stations were of historic significance. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7320.064s">Are</a> you familiar with that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7373.039s">Which</a> we found out they do, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7375.12s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7376.481s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7377.482s">The</a> only reason why I bring it up is because I know these funds go fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7380.725s">We've</a> approved a number of preservation items before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7386.85s">And</a> I just wanna make sure because it would be the city administration reaching out to the community preservation committee requesting funds for a particular purpose like they've done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7397.718s">And</a> I would hope that they're requesting funds <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7400.167s">now</a> to look at some of the renovations on our fire stations.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7489.871s">Just</a> if I could follow up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7491.651s">Danielle,</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7492.712s">So</a> that's an excellent point, because the general remainder is a million three, according to the sheet we have in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7502.134s">So</a> if you're seeing a third, a third, or a third, there's potentially another 400,000 available for historic preservation, including the 204. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7512.116s">So</a> that makes a huge difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7514.576s">That's</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7515.136s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7515.796s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7516.777s">Scott</a> Bailey.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7700.866s">Mr.</a> President, I review the records, find them to be in order and move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7705.029s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7725.219s">Mr.</a> President, just if maybe you could give our schedule for our budget hearings if anyone wants to view.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_-tCCcF67nLU/2024-11-19_-tCCcF67nLU.html">City Council 06-15-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=787.167s">their</a> potential concerns on this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=790.509s">We</a> also did hear back from the traffic engineer and the city engineer regarding the design standards and safety standards that meet state and federal guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=801.776s">And</a> at this point, in my opinion, that intersection of Woburn and High was a free-for-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=809.892s">a</a> complete free-for-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=811.834s">This</a> actually makes a difference, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=815.316s">It</a> clearly defines going up or taking a right or a left. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=820.3s">It</a> clearly defines it now, which never existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=823.663s">Now,</a> if the issue is whether or not a fire apparatus can get there during snow time and clement weather and so forth, that's an issue that needs to be looked at and addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=832.43s">I</a> don't think anyone doubts what former Councilor Pence is stating. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=836.873s">And</a> I'm hoping that's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=839.035s">because</a> we've addressed this on several occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=841.856s">But</a> by no stretch, Mr. President, do I believe that this area was better off prior to the work that was done, because I do believe that work clearly delineates where you have to go now and where you have to stay and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=857.864s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=890.185s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=891.185s">And</a> I don't disagree with you, but I'm saying at some point we have to rely on the experts and the professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=898.252s">And</a> if they're telling us that this complies with all safety standards and so forth, I think we have to at least rely on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=905.158s">But</a> I don't know if that's fully been vetted out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=908.18s">And</a> just because the state came in and did work there, to me, I think it at least, at the very least, requires an additional look. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=916.123s">And</a> that's, I think, what we've been asking for the last three or four weeks, for the city to take an additional look. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=921.825s">Asking</a> to take stuff down now and so forth, I don't have the expertise to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=926.725s">You</a> know, I don't have the expertise to say take something down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=929.868s">What</a> I do have is the common sense to say maybe it should be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=933.832s">But</a> clearly, these type of initiatives, and I've been talking about them for 20 years, so I can't take a back step on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=940.8s">Traffic</a> calming initiatives do work in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=944.138s">And</a> these are traffic calming issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=946.599s">We</a> may not like this one in particular or think it doesn't fit in this particular area, but these bump outs, these extending of sidewalks, these definitely make a difference when it comes to slowing traffic down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=958.803s">It's</a> a known fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=960.444s">It's</a> not only happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=961.984s">It's</a> happening all over the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=963.705s">across</a> the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=964.545s">So</a> I think we have to proceed with caution on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=968.507s">I</a> support having it looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=970.547s">You're</a> right, if it is a safety concern, I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=973.628s">That's</a> a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=974.408s">And</a> if we're in fear that trucks may have a hard time navigating over there, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=980.47s">I</a> think we're obligated to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=982.931s">But</a> I'm not an engineer or a professional to say that we should start redesigning, because I don't know what a redesign would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=990.076s">That's</a> not something that I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=992.738s">So</a> I will support the resolution, because I think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=998.982s">But</a> I'm not prepared to say that we have to take a step back and start redesigning things, because that's not in my realm.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1382.606s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1383.987s">I</a> offered this last week under suspension and therefore under our council rules, it appears the following week, we had many discussions regarding the park on Riverside Ave and the usefulness of having <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1402.033s">a</a> chess, actually a statewide chess club, being able to, on Sundays, use that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1410.257s">And</a> I think, Mr. Vice President, you brought up a great point about that being recognized as a park and may require permitting and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1419.261s">But</a> at the time, one of the organizers, Chris Donovan, who started this roughly two years ago to attract additional foot traffic to Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1430.197s">came</a> up with the idea, and there's a local Method chess club. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1434.779s">They've</a> been going down there ever since, I believe on weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1439.562s">And</a> it was his thought if, you know, the old field of dreams, if we build it out to suit those who play chess, for instance, Chris sent me a number of pitches, which he sent to our director of Parks and Recreation of Stone <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1460.032s">chest</a> tables with chairs that are fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1463.074s">So</a> they're fixed right to the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1464.995s">There's</a> no set up and tear down every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1467.936s">It's</a> far easier for community to put on these type of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1472.418s">And</a> the, according to Chris Donovan, the city's parks and recreations are currently looking at some fixed tables, chest tables to use that are made out of concrete or steel. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1485.965s">They're</a> looking at shade umbrellas because as we all know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1489.611s">That</a> area is pretty wide open to the sun and is not conducive to people playing chess in the sun for any more than a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1499.459s">So</a> they're looking for shade. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1500.821s">They're</a> also looking for, which I believe they just purchased, and I want to thank the city, two foot tall chess pieces that are family friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1509.308s">So</a> if you're not that great of a chess player, you can go down there with your family and put around with the giant two foot chess pieces <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1518.735s">And</a> there'll be people down there that will show you how to play the game of chess, which I think is a family fun activity for all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1527.538s">They're</a> looking to have tournaments down there and for eventually that this be one of the recognized stops in Massachusetts for professional chess tournaments. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1538.281s">And</a> it's just one addition to the square, which I think would be much needed for additional foot traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1546.444s">I</a> want to thank Chris Donovan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1548.985s">for</a> his efforts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1551.207s">And</a> I know my council colleagues agree that we believe that this would be a great asset to the square and something that, you know, provide the additional foot traffic to those businesses that have been stuck with this pandemic for the past 15 months and welcome additional people into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1574.679s">So</a> I just want to thank Chris again and <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1578.323s">I</a> look forward to the city moving forward over the summer with this chess club, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1584.488s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2095.2s">Senior</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2096.76s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2098.001s">That</a> was an excellent update and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2102.043s">My</a> question is, the T will not open unless the sound walls are completed, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2113.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2114.672s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2115.412s">So</a> what's correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2146.929s">So</a> residents that abut the tracks could rest assure more or less that the sound walls, which I know they're going to depend on, will be up when this project is underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2159.184s">So</a> that's all that's going to happen.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2187.223s">Okay,</a> and do we have any update on the naming of the station that would be Ball Square South Method Station?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2280.974s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2281.574s">That</a> pressure started largely in part because you and Jim shaking the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2286.997s">So</a> that was extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2289.159s">I'm</a> glad to hear that it's incorporated in <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2292.813s">the</a> budgets at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2295.034s">Just</a> a last point, Mr. President, I know we've all stated this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2298.577s">I</a> think Jim and Laurel are probably the longest serving volunteers on a project in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2309.205s">And</a> the amount of hours, the time, the effort <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2312.793s">As</a> you can hear, they sound like they're city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2316.955s">They</a> sound like they're the engineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2319.195s">It's</a> really remarkable what two volunteers have done in this community, Jim Silver and Wal Ruma. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2325.818s">And</a> we can't say enough thank you, because if they weren't at every meeting and at the table, I think much of this would have gone unnoticed, and many of the improvements we're seeing wouldn't have taken place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2338.482s">If</a> they weren't actively out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2341.266s">and</a> looking out for the best interest of our residents and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2344.849s">So</a> on behalf of the council, I want to personally thank them both for their extended service on this committee, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2352.855s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2874.55s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2875.751s">And</a> I wanna thank again Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2878.845s">Falco</a> and Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2882.026s">This</a> is common every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2885.247s">We</a> go through this every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2887.848s">Some</a> years we're lucky because we don't have a heat wave until well after the middle of June, but this year we faced a heat wave at the beginning of June, an extended heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2901.954s">The</a> issue to me is that whether it's a management company or whether it's Method Housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2908.993s">If</a> a temperature rises above a certain degree, Mr. President, and from what I read in the paper, that some of these units were upwards of 85 to 90 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2920.041s">You</a> can imagine being in a unit, 85 or 90 degrees, when you open a window and get zero breeze, Mr. President, or you put on a fan and all you're doing is blowing around the 90 degree heat in a unit, that creates heat exhaustion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2935.545s">And</a> if you have comorbidities, like many seniors do, and disabled in our community, that could be a very serious combination. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2944.071s">Very</a> serious combination. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2946.392s">And</a> at the very least, Mr. President, and Councilor Farquhar will hit the nail on the head, the city was slow to operate the cooling stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2955.058s">It</a> was two days into the heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2958.545s">that</a> the city sent out a call saying there was the availability of cooling stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2965.35s">Also,</a> some of the cooling stations, as Councilor Falco alluded to, had hours that were, you know, bankers hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2973.917s">So</a> I guess you can't overheat at nine o'clock at night if it's 90 degrees, and you have nowhere to go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2981.403s">But</a> at the very least, Mr. President, these particular buildings should be equipped <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2987.888s">like</a> emergency management should be in this community, which I have to say, emergency management in this community does not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2997.695s">It's</a> non-existent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2999.136s">So</a> if we depend on emergency management during a true emergency, we're in trouble in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3006.621s">We</a> can't even attend to one building. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3010.464s">What</a> should have happened is portable AC units should have been immediately deployed in that particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3018.788s">immediately.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3019.969s">Every</a> room should have been checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3023.311s">Every</a> room should have been checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3026.652s">And</a> if we weren't able to get the portable AC systems, they should have contacted the hotel across the street or the hotels in Wellington and put people up for the night or two nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3039.72s">What's</a> more important? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3043.562s">It</a> was totally mishandled, Mr. President, and it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3048.509s">and</a> we're not prepared as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3051.794s">This</a> is a shot across the bow for this administration and previous administrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3059.191s">because</a> it's a show of a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3061.112s">When</a> we go through our budget, and when the council sees a budget for $450 for a city of 58,000 people, Mr. President, you're going to say, what type of emergency management are you going to provide to us, to the seniors, to families? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3077.939s">God</a> forbid a true emergency would happen in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3083.261s">The</a> way they address the pandemic, we hear all sorts of accolades. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3088.665s">That</a> should also be the way we address a situation like we had last week, Mr. President, with the heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3095.447s">That</a> should kick into effect with the Board of Health and emergency management. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3102.188s">Did</a> we hear about any emergency management? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3106.229s">Did</a> the residents hear about any emergency management? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3110.23s">No,</a> they had to wait for a newspaper to write an article. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3114.351s">It's</a> unacceptable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3116.175s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3117.075s">And</a> this has been going on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3118.716s">It's</a> not just this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3120.936s">When</a> are we going to get serious with emergency management in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3126.917s">When</a> are we going to have someone head emergency management? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3129.738s">When</a> are we going to fully fund it? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3132.919s">It</a> hasn't happened to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3134.859s">And</a> this budget is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3137.559s">Last</a> year, apparently we had the perfect budget and we got accolades for having the perfect budget and mechanically, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3145.034s">Maybe</a> it was the perfect budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3146.496s">Maybe</a> it was written up and it looked great and had a great cover on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3151.382s">But</a> it's the substance that matters, what's inside the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3154.786s">And</a> we sorely underfund emergency management. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3158.171s">No</a> one wants to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3160.153s">We</a> sorely underfund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3161.675s">And</a> when it comes up, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3163.988s">I'm</a> going to be the first to shake the tree once again and find out why we're not fully funding emergency management, why we don't have a full time dedicated person. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3173.837s">This</a> is not something you give someone a $500 stipend and say, Hey, here's your hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3178.501s">You're</a> in charge of emergency management for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3182.344s">There's</a> grant funding out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3183.665s">We're</a> not taking advantage of this programs out there that we could take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3190.57s">There's</a> companies that will come in and provide services at very little to no cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3196.374s">But</a> you have to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3197.615s">You</a> have to have someone in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3200.537s">And</a> it's not happening in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3203.379s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3203.939s">And</a> I thank my colleagues for bringing this up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3260.13s">The</a> council pushed to save that emergency room and it was out of our control, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3264.834s">This</a> council didn't support saving that emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3267.556s">You</a> are correct.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3302.698s">I</a> didn't put mine in the form of a motion, but I'd like to put mine in the form of a motion regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3308.367s">the</a> budget and the lack of funding in this community for emergency preparedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3315.371s">I'd</a> like to get a response back from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3317.812s">How</a> they're going to increase the emergency preparedness and awareness in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3324.976s">And</a> also that if this ever happens again in this community, that portable air conditioning units, as well as putting people up in hotels, Mr. President, and public housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3336.372s">or</a> in private, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3338.773s">They're</a> making money hand over fist in these private buildings, and they should take care of their residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3346.135s">So</a> I would ask that that be part of the report as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3378.005s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3812.61s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3813.75s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for his putting this on the agenda and for also his personal words because <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3822.189s">I</a> think his tribute really struck home with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3826.513s">Knowing</a> Bud, you know, Bud was a friend to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3831.417s">I</a> had him a teacher when I was at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3833.839s">He</a> was my teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3835.961s">You</a> know, I didn't play any sports under Bud. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3838.964s">I</a> actually wrestled for Method High School, but he was the athletic director and he cared about every program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3845.618s">And</a> he cared about every kid individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3848.56s">And</a> he had a relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3850.061s">I</a> don't know how he did it with every kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3853.324s">And</a> we all respected him. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3855.285s">And</a> he was tough as nails when he had to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3857.887s">And</a> he let you know that he was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3860.209s">And</a> if you did something wrong, he let you know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3862.95s">But</a> he also had a side that was very sensitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3866.273s">And</a> Bud was truly a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3870.236s">His</a> wife, Judy, we used to joke around, come around this time every July. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3875.632s">His</a> wife and I would meet, and we used to meet at Stop and Shop around the cherries that came out every July, and we'd be the first in the cherry section, and we'd pick through all the cherries because we were cherry fiends. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3889.603s">And</a> we used to laugh about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3890.944s">And</a> they're just a great couple, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3897.289s">Bud,</a> I think, would be the first to lend a hand, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3903.073s">If</a> he needed something, he'd be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3905.716s">He'd</a> be the first to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3907.177s">He'd</a> be the first to extend himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3909.679s">He'd</a> be the first to go to bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3911.8s">And,</a> you know, that's what I remember about Bud Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3914.882s">And</a> you're absolutely right, my council colleagues, all three of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3920.606s">You</a> know, as we lose people of this character, people that made the city what it is, Mr. President, it truly is not just the loss of someone, it's the loss of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3934.559s">a</a> feeling in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3936.4s">It's</a> the loss knowing that someone has your back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3939.44s">It's</a> the loss of having someone that is there with your best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3944.882s">And</a> I think as we lose people like that, we really lose a part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3949.603s">And</a> I'm hoping that we start to build that camaraderie. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3953.084s">We</a> start to build that sense of neighborhood, that sense of belonging. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3959.486s">And</a> that's what, you know, I think Bud instilled <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3963.649s">how</a> he acted in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3965.531s">It</a> really was a sense of pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3967.673s">And</a> if you didn't go to the Thanksgiving football game, let me tell you, especially in the high school, you weren't getting an A or B anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3976.219s">You</a> had to go to the game and he used to take attendance, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3980.222s">And</a> the crowds were huge because of Bud Kelly and because of the spirit and the pride that Bud Kelly had, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3987.784s">And</a> you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3989.104s">The</a> blue and white, I don't think you can meet someone that had more blue and whites with their veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3994.425s">Um,</a> and he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3996.386s">I,</a> I feel awful, uh, for, uh, Judy and, uh, Beth and, um, uh, Linda and, uh, you know, the rest of the family, um, including the son-in-laws and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4008.609s">Uh,</a> because Bud was an excellent husband, father, grandfather, friend, coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4016.667s">You</a> name it, he excelled at everything and found the time to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4021.109s">And</a> he will surely be missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4024.25s">I</a> ask, I know my colleague would want it, that we name Bud Kelly, dedicate this meeting after Bud Kelly in all his years of service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4035.595s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4819.737s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4825.18s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4827.329s">So</a> the lot on Middlesex Ave is quite a large lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4832.915s">So</a> I could see that working on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4835.438s">The</a> lot on Commercial Street is a very difficult lot to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4840.664s">And</a> I can only imagine during construction, I was just wondering if you can lay out what the plans are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4846.711s">You</a> said there's a tent and <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4848.39s">you</a> know, they're going to be able to access through the tent and drive through. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4852.291s">Can</a> you just explain, are they going to use the existing drive-through even though it's closed as a way to go in and out of that very small lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4861.674s">Can</a> you just explain how it's going to work?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4896.018s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4896.618s">So</a> part of my concern, Mr. President, and I know they're actually working on the Dunkin' Donuts on the Fellsway right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4904.824s">It's</a> been closed for <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4906.12s">I</a> believe two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4908.641s">But</a> part of my concern is when this duck and donuts originally went in, there was some grave concern about the queuing up of cars that are going through the drive-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4920.186s">And</a> the reason that was raised is we all know that engine four is next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4925.488s">And</a> believe it or not, it's not unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4927.849s">I</a> live in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4929.194s">that</a> on certain days, you'll see the cars queuing up onto Commercial Street and out onto Riverside Ave, and not far from the entrance to the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4942.485s">My</a> only concern now is you're gonna be backing up where cars are gonna be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4947.249s">The</a> tent will be right where the entrance is, I assume where the doors are, and you're gonna be backing up cars queuing onto Riverside and Commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4957.765s">And</a> depending on the flow and so forth, I have some concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4963.609s">Is</a> this something that has been run by public safety officials in the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4976.096s">I</a> would just respectfully ask, I'm not opposed to what they're trying to do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4980.459s">I</a> just want to make sure it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4983.311s">Like</a> I said, this is a much smaller lot than Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4986.574s">Middlesex</a> Ave can accommodate, you know, the big Apple Circus there under a tent and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4992.317s">But</a> Commercial Street is a congested lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4995.439s">There's</a> no access from Riverside Ave into their lot, either come into Commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5000.903s">Getting</a> in and out of their lot inherently is difficult already. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5005.621s">and</a> I'm sure you would know as someone that's involved with that Dunkin Donuts, I just wanna make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5012.104s">So</a> I would ask that approval be conditioned upon getting approval from both the fire and police chief that they don't anticipate any concerns with public safety regarding access to our fire trucks getting in and out of engine four and also safety with the president of vehicles queuing up potentially onto Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5034.167s">So</a> that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5222.377s">Move</a> approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5226.598s">As</a> amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5227.678s">As</a> amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5228.478s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5276.512s">With</a> the condition, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5279.245s">Duncan</a> Donuts receive a sign off from both the chief of police and the fire chief regarding any potential safety concerns.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_SxgiOOMwDHY/2024-11-19_SxgiOOMwDHY.html">City Council 06-08-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=161.651s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=162.871s">It's</a> an honor and a pleasure to rise here tonight to recognize one of Medford's finest that we have in the audience tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=170.174s">Kaylee,</a> can you stand up, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=185.059s">Mr.</a> President, as early as age five, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=189.102s">Kaylee</a> used to play baseball, T-ball, in the backyard with her grandpa, Papa. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=195.629s">And</a> that's Richard Laidlaw. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=197.792s">And</a> as early as age five, Kaylee used to say to her grandpa, someday I want to play baseball for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=205.36s">And</a> her grandpa, like every other grandpa, would say, OK, maybe someday you'll play baseball. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=212.122s">And</a> he used to tap her on the shoulder and say, maybe someday you'll play. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=215.803s">And</a> then Kaylee, knowing that she was ambitious and wanted to succeed, spent countless hours practicing and honing in our skills at Gillis Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=230.763s">While</a> other kids were out doing different things, Kaylee was down there with an instructor, learning how to catch, hit, run, the fundamentals of baseball, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=241.469s">It</a> was her dream to play baseball at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=245.811s">Through</a> hard work and determination, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=248.572s">Kaylee</a> earned a spot on Medford High School baseball team, breaking the glass ceiling for many other young women becoming the first female to play Medford High School JV baseball. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=263.98s">I'm</a> offering a motion tonight, Mr. President, requesting that the city council recognize Kaylee Laylaw <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=271.516s">for</a> her dedication and commitment by issuing a formal council accommodation recognizing her first of a kind accomplishments in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=282.548s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I would like to recognize at this time, we have not only Kaylee here, but we have the entire baseball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=291.891s">How</a> often do you see an entire team, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=294.992s">I</a> think it speaks volumes for the camaraderie and the feelings that all the players have for each other and the fact that they have these same feelings for Kaylee and honor Kaylee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=306.515s">So</a> if the baseball team could please stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=309.696s">Come</a> on, everyone stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=325.268s">I</a> was also told, Mr. President, from Gino DeSimone, who's the coach in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=332.632s">And</a> the one thing he said, please don't have me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=336.393s">So</a> I know he's a man of few words, but carries a big stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=340.615s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=341.456s">So</a> we're not going to have Gino speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=343.117s">But</a> Gino has done a tremendous job as coach of the JV team. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=349.133s">He's</a> done a tremendous job bringing in this group of kids, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=354.418s">Their</a> record's two, three, and one. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=356.36s">And</a> I know they can only get better as the year goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=359.864s">But</a> on a good piece, Mr. President, they just had a game against Lynn Classical. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=366.451s">And</a> Kaylee hit a double, bringing in two runs, Mr. President, which won them the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=382.529s">So</a> I think, Mr. President, what we see here tonight is really a group of kids getting together, banding together, being able to accomplish goals, Mr. President, goals in which unite everyone as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=398.453s">And</a> now more than ever, I think we need to look to this team, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=404.034s">as</a> leaders, Mr. President, in a community that I believe is currently divided over a lot of different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=411.116s">And</a> here we have youngsters that are saying how it is to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=415.918s">No</a> matter who you are, let's work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=418.519s">Let's</a> unite for a common goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=420.699s">And</a> we're seeing that tonight here with these players, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=424.261s">I</a> want to thank the coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=425.561s">I</a> want to thank the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=426.721s">I</a> want to thank Kaylee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=428.202s">And</a> last but not least, Kaylee's family, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=433.455s">Because</a> without that support at home, and the parents that drive, a lot of the parents are here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=439.316s">I</a> see them in the back row. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=440.897s">They're</a> the ones that get the kids back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=443.257s">They're</a> the ones that go out and get the equipment when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=445.638s">They're</a> the ones that take the Saturday nights, the Sundays, the Monday practices, the Tuesday, the Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=451.179s">They're</a> the ones that put in the hard work as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=453.599s">So</a> this is truly a family effort, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=457.221s">So</a> on behalf of this council, I'd like to personally, I know my colleagues have things to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=461.744s">I'd</a> like to personally thank the Laidlaw family. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=465.286s">I'd</a> like to congratulate Kaylee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=467.027s">I'd</a> like to congratulate the team, the coach, Method Sports in general, Mr. President, all the student athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=474.652s">And</a> I would ask that we send out a council accommodation and also take a team picture as well as a picture with Kaylee and her family once the council is done giving their accolades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=486.179s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=487.212s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1303.692s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1305.392s">Again,</a> it's with great honor that I rise here tonight to bring up a former resident of this community, Mr. President, Sarah Bradley Fulton. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1315.175s">Sarah</a> lived from 1740 to 1835 and was Method's heroine of the American Revolution, often called the mother of the Boston Tea Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1326.972s">as</a> she came up with the idea to disguise the Sons of Liberty as Mohawk Indians and helped her Boston sister-in-law outfit them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1336.98s">Sarah</a> was appointed leader of the Daughters of Liberty, who oversaw the boycott of the British goods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1344.586s">She</a> organized a makeshift hospital in Medford for the injured American soldiers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1350.671s">Following</a> the Battle of Bunker Hill, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1354.03s">Famously,</a> Sarah Bradley Fulton acted as a spy, delivering dispatches from General Washington behind enemy lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1363.919s">President</a> Washington thanked Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1365.52s">Fulton</a> for her heroics by making a personal visit to see her at her Method Farmhouse, located in the vicinity of Fulton Street, which is named after her following her death. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1380.73s">The</a> Marquise de Lafayette also visited Sarah at her home to say thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1388.134s">It's</a> also fitting that the city of Medford follow the lead of George Washington and Lafayette by honoring one of their own, by declaring Sarah Bradley Fulton Day in early October of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1408.118s">Mr.</a> President, we have the distinct honor, if any one of the council has any questions, we happen to have Sarah Bradley Fulton herself here tonight in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1424.791s">And</a> if any members of the council have any question why we should recognize Sarah, I think the only appropriate person to answer would be Sarah herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1435.418s">So</a> Sarah, are you in the audience?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1764.485s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1766.186s">If</a> I could, just for the edification of the viewing audience, there's a great story that's on Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1773.909s">You</a> can go on at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1775.709s">It's</a> the story of Sarah Bradley Fulton, which is the heroine of the American Revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1781.891s">I</a> believe it's 33 minutes long, and it's a great depiction of what Sarah did for not only the city of Medford, or the township of Medford at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1791.974s">but</a> also for the entire country, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1794.936s">And</a> I think anyone that wants to read up on Sarah or view, I think that would be an excellent idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1799.94s">I</a> also want to thank, you probably don't know her, Laura Duggan. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1803.022s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1803.963s">Laura</a> Duggan. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1804.724s">Oh,</a> she is?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1810.083s">She's</a> a local historian that does tremendous work on local access and keeping up with Medford history. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1818.827s">And</a> you know, you really should pay a visit to her as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2588.022s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2589.832s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2591.053s">And</a> I just have to say, Mike, Mike is a pretty intimidating, intimidating person. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2597.558s">And</a> you know, when he speaks, Mr. President, I think, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, his words really resonate with at least with me and I know with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2608.867s">And</a> since he's taken over the Veterans Affairs Office, there's been a renewed interest in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2615.811s">And</a> I really mean that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2617.232s">And</a> I think it's partly due because of your interest and your enthusiasm and your ability to speak on behalf of those that can't speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2627.858s">You</a> know, when you think about Veterans Day, we hear about the many volunteers and there's a lot of great volunteers that do it without any fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2636.943s">And</a> as the council has mentioned, they'll be out there in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2640.284s">Council</a> Vice President Knight mentioned working out of their trunk and not looking for, you know, to speak to a reporter or get accolades. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2649.986s">They're</a> doing it because they believe in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2651.967s">And</a> they believe that we should recognize those who made the ultimate sacrifice, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2656.888s">But</a> Mike not only deals with, you know, putting flags out, Mike deals with veteran benefits all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2663.79s">Mike</a> deals with veterans that are suicidal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2667.472s">Mike</a> deals with veterans that are homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2671.055s">Mike</a> deals with veterans that have mental illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2673.776s">There's</a> a host of issues that people probably aren't aware of, but the Veterans Office is out there to assist and assist those in need, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2685.264s">And</a> I truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to thank you for your action. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2690.947s">as</a> the veteran affairs coordinator, administrator, and whatever we can do as a community, I hope you're very vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2700.591s">I</a> hope you come out and let us know what we can do on behalf of the veterans in our community, any way we can assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2707.254s">It</a> would be helpful to hear directly from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2709.736s">I</a> appreciate that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2744.045s">I</a> was not aware of that, and I want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2745.965s">That's</a> that's honorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2747.186s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2749.586s">Coach</a> buckle.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3317.17s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3318.551s">We</a> have a unique opportunity, Mr. President, to join with the Method Chess Club, which began over two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3326.778s">And</a> they're looking to restart its Sunday outdoor chess club at the Riverside Ave Park, right on Riverside Ave, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3338.287s">And</a> the first chess club meeting is Sunday, June 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3343.511s">And</a> the club expects anywhere from 20 to 40 people will participate over the next few Sundays, bringing in additional foot traffic, which we all know we need to help assist our local economy and our local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3359.095s">Methodist</a> placed, Mr. President, to become a chess haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3364.918s">for</a> New England if and when we can get these chess players, the best in New England, to come into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3373.628s">But</a> we need a little assistance from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3377.213s">And</a> originally when this started a few years back, the city was gracious enough to assist <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3383.14s">But</a> now the Chess Club would like to move this into a more advanced atmosphere, Mr. President, where we're welcoming people from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3395.585s">We're</a> welcoming the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3397.966s">The</a> Chess Club is looking for four new concrete chess tables, Mr. President, to help assist that could be used for multi-purposes, not just for chess. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3410.27s">They're</a> looking for three inexpensive sunshades, Mr. President, for a day like today when it's 95, and I'm sure we're going to get some hot Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3420.517s">And</a> they're looking for new two-foot-tall, family-friendly chess pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3426.62s">to</a> be available for public use. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3428.722s">So</a> this is truly a family type atmosphere, Mr. President, and welcomes all Method residents to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3436.848s">And</a> if you don't know how to play chess, there'll be people there to teach you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3440.611s">There'll</a> be ways that you could join the club, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3444.073s">There'll</a> be all different ways you can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3446.936s">And</a> if you just want to watch a friendly chess game, I happen to love chess. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3451.279s">I</a> don't play it often, but I happen to love chess. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3453.761s">And</a> it is a great, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3455.922s">game,</a> Mr. President, for those to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3458.744s">They're</a> also looking if the city could pitch in and provide a water spigot on that particular piece of property for larger events. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3468.03s">And</a> one person I do want to recognize that got this off the ground <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3472.813s">and</a> actually got a number of initiatives in this community off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3476.716s">He's</a> always working on some great initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3479.979s">It's</a> Chris Donovan, and he happens to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3483.142s">And</a> I'd like to ask him if he'd want to just say a few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3486.305s">He</a> was instrumental in getting this up and running, Mr. President, and know the needs firsthand on how to attract to make this really a mecca for chess, which I think would be a great attraction to our square.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4418.321s">I</a> think it's just a table of, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4419.882s">I</a> almost put it on the age of recommendations tonight, but I was told to make recommendations because the president went out of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4433.812s">you</a> know, someone from the administration's watching this meeting, we made a number of recommendations and we wouldn't need a formal vote, but if, you know, we can take a formal vote next week.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4504.759s">As</a> we all know, when we hired Clerk Kirby, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4509.003s">that</a> we gave him a three-year appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4511.544s">That</a> appointment is coming up this September, September 1st, to be precise. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4516.805s">And</a> I think where we have so much going on with budgetary and so forth, I would respectfully request that we meet Mr. President and the committee of the whole within the next week or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4527.728s">Next</a> Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4529.268s">Next</a> Tuesday night, that's perfect to discuss the reappointment of the city clerk, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4723.06s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4724.401s">Just</a> if I could, and I am supportive of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4728.522s">The</a> question I had was I was approached by a number of first responders in our community stating that there was also grant money available for those that worked as first responders during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4742.946s">And</a> I would respectfully amend this to ask if the city has filed for any grants that would be out there for increasing salary for first responders during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4758.245s">I</a> know there's money in this particular <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4761.929s">narrative,</a> but there's also other funds out there that other communities, Mr. President, are applying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4767.855s">And</a> I would hate to see us not apply on behalf of our police, fire and EMS. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4772.199s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4773.68s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4966.197s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4967.378s">As</a> my colleague stated, Ralph Scopa was a dedicated employee for many years in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4972.641s">I</a> believe three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4974.562s">And,</a> you know, he treated every street, every road, every area of this community like it was his backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4981.186s">And</a> really, when Councilor Scarpelli and Vice President Knight talk about him, he really had Medford pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4987.65s">And</a> that's shown right through him, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4990.691s">And,</a> you know, I think in this day and age, you know, it's nice to have people to step up and say, you know, I care about this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4999.193s">Even</a> though he was a city employee, he did many other facets in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5003.514s">It</a> wasn't just regarding his DPW service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5006.334s">He</a> stepped up to the plate each and every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5009.235s">And</a> the Scopa family truly are one of the great families in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5015.157s">And</a> Ralph will be sorely missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5558.727s">You</a> know, what's crucial to make this work is in-house training as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5563.01s">And</a> I know that's part of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5565.932s">You</a> know, to me, tens of thousands of dollars to set this up doesn't sound like a realistic, you know, and we haven't seen anything that doesn't sound realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5574.178s">This</a> is going to take far more staff than we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5577.5s">And</a> when you add in all the boards, the 40, 50-odd boards and commissions that meet, along with the council and the school committee, you're not going to have one person like Patrick running all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5588.448s">You're</a> not going to have two people, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5590.65s">You're</a> probably going to need a half a dozen people to be actively involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5594.933s">And</a> I'm just throwing that number out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5597.435s">This</a> is a much larger endeavor than just tens of thousands. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5601.998s">I</a> think you're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars to have this established, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5606.862s">It's</a> something we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5608.202s">We're</a> going to be discussing budget soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5610.063s">If</a> we're serious about that, then maybe that's the time to have the discussion as well during budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5615.484s">We</a> just found out what our authority is as a council, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5618.985s">And</a> if this is not an item that's currently within the maids budget, and I don't remember seeing it in the budget we just received yesterday, that we can add this as a line item, Mr. President, if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5631.207s">So</a> if this is something we're interested, we can definitely have it added as long as we have the facts.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5743.399s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5745.1s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5745.58s">Mr.</a> President, while we're under suspension, we have members of the public that would like to speak on the public participation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6510.383s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6510.523s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6511.864s">Council</a> Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6512.965s">Just</a> if I could, and I think I'm obligated to say something on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6519.099s">I</a> appreciate knowing Rick Orlando for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6522.461s">I</a> know Rick as a level-headed person, someone that speaks his mind, Mr. President, but also equally listens and hear what other people have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6532.206s">And</a> it's very disheartening, Mr. President, when you have a resident that's been in this city for a number of years, active in so many aspects of this community, that feels that his voice is being left out of a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6544.888s">especially</a> a process, Mr. President, of a public body. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6549.472s">That</a> really, really enrages me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6553.756s">I</a> understand they have rules and regulations, and they can follow, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6558.061s">But</a> when a resident comes up to the podium, whether it's school committee, city council, board of commissions, every resident should have the right, the taxpayer, to ask a question, Mr. President, of their elected officials or their appointed bodies, whether they're boards or commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6574.253s">Everyone</a> has a right to do it respectfully, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6577.715s">And</a> to cut out people, to not allow them to speak because they may be saying something you don't want to hear is an outright disgrace, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6587.118s">An</a> outright disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6590.821s">And</a> that's what's happened for the past year with this circus that's going on in this community that's dividing us, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6598.947s">I've</a> never seen so many executive sessions in all my 26 years of elected office in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6608.995s">What's</a> the cloak of secrecy that's going on that you need that many executive sessions, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6616.455s">That's</a> what the discussion should be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6621.578s">If</a> you feel strongly about an issue, own up to it, and also allow people to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6627.342s">It's</a> when you run from an issue, Mr. President, that makes people believe something's going on that's rotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6633.926s">And</a> that's what people believe in this community, whether it's true or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6638.889s">And</a> I don't want to be part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6640.89s">And</a> anyone that wants to come up to this podium, whether I agree or not, they have the right to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6646.017s">And</a> if we have to take hours like we've done in the past to listen to people, that's what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6651.0s">And</a> the school committee should be doing the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6653.781s">Shame</a> on all of them, all of them, the whole bunch, for not allowing someone standing up and allowing people to speak at a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6663.167s">And</a> not even a common courtesy, Mr. President, when you know there's a number of people on the same issue, to make them wait three or four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6672.292s">Shame</a> on them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6675.868s">The</a> people have the right to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6678.429s">And</a> they should have the common dignity to say, we have a lot of people on an issue here, let them speak at the beginning of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6685.491s">Because</a> Mr. Orlando is 100% correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6688.512s">That's</a> just an attempt to stifle people and weed people out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6693.394s">Shame</a> on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6695.615s">And</a> people that show up to a meeting, we just talked about tonight, about having Zoom and the increased participation on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6702.793s">What</a> about the participation when someone shows up at a meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6706.194s">Physically</a> takes the time and comes down, and you don't want to hear them.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7796.512s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7797.913s">Mr.</a> President, I wanna thank Todd. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7799.253s">You</a> know, I know there's a lot he's working on in every part of the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7803.847s">So</a> I really want to thank him. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7805.128s">He's</a> like a one man team. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7809.513s">But</a> Mr. President, every year this community pays an assessment to the team that comes directly off our cherry sheet that comes from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7818.043s">Millions</a> of dollars we pay for MBTA services. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7822.392s">And</a> as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, when they start eliminating bus stops, when they start eliminating bus routes, like the 325 and the 326, that, in my opinion, is a diminishing of bus MBTA services in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7839.444s">Nowhere</a> else, Mr. President, would you get a diminishing service and pay the same or more for an assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7846.189s">It</a> makes zero sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7849.591s">Right</a> out here in back of City Hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7852.576s">They</a> have bus stops where they idle their buses, the MBTA, on city-owned property. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7859.844s">City-owned</a> parking lot, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7862.207s">The</a> MBTA has practical use of that parking lot out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7866.832s">I</a> don't know what's going on, Mr. President, but this community needs to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7871.57s">And</a> if it's a matter of holding back some money from the T assessment to get them at the table and to negotiate with the MBTA regarding what's going on regarding service and so forth, that's what needs to be had, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7884.938s">This</a> has been going on far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7886.819s">We</a> need leadership in this community to stand up and say, we're not going to tolerate this anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7892.303s">And</a> that project on Winter Street's no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7895.121s">When</a> that project came out about a year ago, Mr. President, I know we were all vocal, but I mentioned that a year ago, that we're going to lose control of what happens on that particular road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7906.345s">And</a> when we said we're going to lose parking, Mr. President, then when they talk about putting a bike path to nowhere, those were questions that we raised that fell on deaf ears, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7918.45s">And</a> now you see a project that we have little say in, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7922.831s">I</a> mean, we heard, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7925.089s">Todd</a> Blake mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7926.69s">This</a> is a state project. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7928.292s">We</a> have very little say. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7930.434s">The</a> chief executive officer has to bring these state agencies to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7934.999s">We</a> can't allow them to roll over us on behalf of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7939.163s">And</a> Council Vice President Knight's a thousand percent correct when he said you're diverting traffic into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7946.83s">And</a> that's exactly what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7950.825s">You're</a> taking them off a major thoroughfare that's set up for this type of traffic, and you're putting them into neighborhoods, Mr. President, that's not set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7960.569s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8563.384s">Motion</a> to refer back, Mr. President, to the Office of Community Development.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw/2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw.html">City Council 06-01-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=622.722s">So</a> the other closest BMW is in Somerville, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=649.481s">Okay,</a> so it's strictly going to be certified pre-owned? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=652.822s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=654.363s">And</a> how long has Herb Chambers owned that particular piece of property?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=680.45s">And</a> Herb Chambers Infinity didn't last too long there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=683.131s">Do</a> you know what the reasoning was behind that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=697.478s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=698.565s">You</a> said we had someone from the corporate office on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=700.827s">I'd</a> like to know, because honestly, when the Infinity came in, I think a lot of people were happy to see a luxury car establishment go in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=710.213s">And</a> then I'd say maybe six months, eight months, it wasn't very long. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=714.396s">And</a> then it's been vacant for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=717.558s">And</a> I'm just hoping that's not going to be the same scenario again.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=742.084s">Can</a> we hear from someone from the corporate office regarding the infinity, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=788.161s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=788.681s">Um,</a> so, uh, Mr. President, um, I would ask, uh, at this point, um, if, uh, the only plans that they're going to have is to sell pre-owned certified, is that going to be the full intent
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=831.795s">So</a> pre-owned, it's not going to be strictly BMWs? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=834.656s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=835.597s">So</a> it'll be other cars other than that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=838.522s">So</a> I'll be able to go and afford one of your cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=840.924s">That</a> was a legit question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=847.327s">So</a> you'll have other cars on the lot as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=852.311s">Mr.</a> President, Herb Chambers has been a long established as the good attorney stated, in business for 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=859.415s">From</a> what I know of Herb Chambers, a very reputable business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=863.998s">Someone</a> that stands by their cars, I think has a great track record. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=868.315s">and</a> I think the Herb Chambers BMW will be a great addition to Mystic F.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1187.321s">So</a> why don't we do this, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1189.242s">Why</a> don't we put that condition on and then do a six month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1192.603s">And</a> if there's other conditions, we can put them on after the six month review.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1200.145s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1200.805s">That</a> one condition that council one night, vice president night, and then we'll do a motion for a six month review.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1541.743s">President.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1543.504s">Council</a> Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1545.144s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1546.925s">In</a> the report from the chief of fire, it states that no obvious violations observed and it's pending final inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1557.589s">We've</a> had this come up in the past, Mr. President, that I, as one member of the council, would, uh, like to see the final approval signed off prior to any issuance by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1571.164s">And</a> we've discussed that in the past, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1573.645s">I'm</a> not sure why this is still the process that we're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1578.668s">And</a> also under the Board of Health, it said it needs final approval from fire and the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1585.351s">So</a> is there a reason why we're approving this prior to final approvals from department heads?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1709.335s">Mr.</a> President, I have no problem with this particular one moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1713.862s">contingent</a> upon approval from the police, I mean the fire department and the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1721.067s">However,</a> Mr. President, moving forward, I would ask that we have a meeting with the chief of fire and the building commissioner to find out what process would better fit us so that we're not approving items that haven't been signed off or at least fully signed off by and fully vetted by <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1743.809s">the</a> departments that should be.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1800.033s">So</a> the report we received from the Chief of Staff <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1805.34s">2021</a> states no obvious violations observed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1809.101s">And</a> it says pending final inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1812.942s">So</a> if these tanks haven't been put in yet, then how would no obvious violations observed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1821.484s">What</a> is the chief observing?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1832.466s">I</a> think that's why we need to meet on this to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1835.629s">what's</a> going on, but not, not this particular one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1837.87s">I'll</a> move. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1838.25s">You</a> know, we're moving forward with this one, but I think we have to find out the language of these reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1843.811s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1844.231s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3259.911s">for</a> offering this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3262.132s">Mr.</a> President, you know, this doesn't happen often before the city council that, you know, we have residents in this community that rise to such a level that deserves recognition and honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3276.799s">And</a> truly becoming an Eagle Scout deserves that honor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3282.262s">We</a> have Derek in the audience tonight with his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3285.964s">We're</a> gonna ask him to come to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3288.698s">You're</a> not gonna get off that easy, Derek. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3294.473s">If</a> we could turn on his mic too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3297.119s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3298.142s">You</a> know, it truly is an honor, Mr. President, to rise to a level of Eagle Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3304.287s">The</a> amount of effort, time that is put in, Mr. President, not just by Eagle Scout, but the family, because the family is involved in a lot of aspects of becoming an Eagle Scout, whether it's trips into the woods, Mr. President, or doing projects or public service and community projects, there's much involved that involves the whole family. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3327.683s">And</a> I think that's what being Eagle Scout is all about, is to have the camaraderie and the family unit together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3340.112s">And</a> being Eagle Scout is truly a family unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3343.294s">I</a> would just ask <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3344.766s">Derek,</a> if you can give us a little brief synopsis of your time and working up to the Eagle Scout, what your community project was, because I know that's a requirement of the Eagle Scout badge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3357.45s">And</a> if you could just give us a little tidbit about the involvement, I know your parents are here and I believe you might have a sibling here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3365.373s">If</a> you can just give us a little synopsis.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3464.303s">Can</a> you tell us a little personal about yourself, schooling or anything that interests, what other interests do you have, Derek?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3510.056s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3510.716s">I'm</a> a proud graduate of the method vocational school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3514.378s">And</a> your parents should be very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3515.979s">You</a> seem like a great young gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3518.581s">And</a> I see great things in your future. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3521.042s">And</a> I know my colleagues have other things to add as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4243.618s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4244.979s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4247.901s">This</a> is a very important subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4250.242s">And</a> when it comes to the residents of this community, I think everyone should at least rest assured that if they are getting gas or using one of our measurement devices in any stores, that at least they're paying what they should be paying, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4267.553s">So</a> I think this is a worthy thing to track. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4271.015s">I</a> would also ask, Mr. President, I believe as part of the weights and measures position, that they also check the octane of the gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4279.162s">And</a> they have the ability to check the octane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4281.483s">And</a> that's also another issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4283.925s">I'm</a> not saying it's happening currently, but when you're paying a higher premium for a higher octane gas and you're not getting that, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4290.951s">That's</a> another thing that the city is supposed to be checking to make sure that you're receiving what you're paying for, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4300.039s">So</a> this is a job that's little known. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4302.721s">You</a> don't hear much about it, but it's a very important role in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4307.805s">And</a> I think it's something that we should get an update immediately on in the interest of not only the consumers, but in the interest of <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4317.307s">knowing</a> Mr. President that all our department heads are working and everyone's doing their job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4323.152s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4355.611s">Mr.</a> President, I forgot to mention also too, that the oil trucks that are located for many oil businesses in the city of method, they have to go to the city of Somerville to get their trucks checked as the president, which is usually done by weights and measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4372.11s">in</a> every community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4372.99s">So</a> that's another thing that we're sending outside of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4376.971s">And</a> as Councilor Falco mentioned, rightfully so, revenue is going outside of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4382.153s">And</a> that's something that we should be mindful of. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4384.593s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4385.594s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5230.36s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5231.661s">And</a> I'm not sure if a city engineer can answer some of these questions, but I would ask that when we do meet that these questions be answered prior to that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5242.948s">One</a> is how much do we have in the retained earnings for water and sewer enterprise accounts? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5250.634s">Last</a> time I believe there was over 5 million in those accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5254.593s">And</a> those accounts are used, Mr. President, for infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5260.015s">And</a> this would be an infrastructure improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5262.577s">So</a> I'm not sure why we would borrow when we have $5 million in raised money currently sitting in an account for such purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5271.481s">My</a> other question, Mr. President, is the MWRA program, assistance program, used to provide 0% finance loans to low cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5283.963s">I</a> believe that is still ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5287.544s">And</a> I would ask for the last three years, if Method has utilized the allocation that we would be given for 0% finance loans for infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5300.207s">And</a> if so, how much has been used and for what projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5305.448s">And</a> the city administration is also referring to grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5309.069s">Is</a> there an active grant that the city is pursuing now <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5313.86s">in</a> which they perceive will pay for this particular loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5318.681s">And</a> if so, I'd like to know what the grant is that's out there, Mr. President, and if the city plans on applying.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6925.645s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6926.426s">The</a> affirmative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6928.229s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6929.635s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6931.216s">Mr.</a> President, I would just ask that where we have an increase in public participation here at the chamber, that the chairs be set up, Mr. President, formally to conduct business here and accommodate the increase of public participation here.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6953.615s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6956.537s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6957.63s">Mr.</a> President, we had a loss of a longtime Method resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6961.453s">I</a> just found out about Richard Sullivan, better known as Dick Sullivan, Dickie Sullivan, from the West Method area. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6970.159s">Many</a> of us knew Dick Sullivan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6973.542s">He</a> was a longtime resident of the West Method area. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6978.125s">You'd</a> always see him frequent the businesses and stores at the West Method Spa and a number of stores there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6985.054s">and</a> we recently lost Richard Dickey Sullivan, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE/2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE.html">City Council 05-25-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1386.631s">Mr.</a> President, Councilor Marks you have the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1389.794s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1390.495s">I</a> want to thank President Caraviello for putting this on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1394.677s">When</a> this issue was presented to the city council, that was one of the recommendations the president council, President Caraviello just mentioned, was to have the area be paved in totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1405.803s">So</a> rather than space it from one intersection to another, which didn't make sense, was to have that stretch, which is only maybe a couple hundred yards, four or 500 yards, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1418.063s">to</a> have it paved curb to curb the entire length. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1421.264s">And</a> that would increase the longevity of the construction, the roadwork itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1428.366s">And</a> it only made sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1430.686s">Secondly,</a> this council voted unanimously to continue the bike lane, which starts in front of Brooks School and goes all the way up to the top of High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1444.329s">And</a> then where it bends down, it actually stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1447.473s">And</a> we ask that they continue the bike lane to Winter Circle, Mr. President, because there'd be nothing worse than riding your bike there and all of a sudden come up to a decline where you're gonna pick up speed and there's no more bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1460.423s">It</a> makes absolutely no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1462.385s">So</a> I know we have the city engineer on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1465.887s">I'm</a> hoping maybe he can let us know if that is still under consideration, because I believe that was something the city was gonna look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1474.214s">So</a> I would ask maybe if Tim McGiven could give us a response.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2127.021s">What</a> does the city engineer say, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2130.484s">The</a> chair recognizes Councilor Mux. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2132.539s">I</a> think what we're hearing, and I hear what Councilor Prentice stating, I think what we're hearing is a commitment from the city engineer and a commitment from the traffic engineer to take a look at this first thing tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2143.049s">And</a> if they deem it to be a safety concern, then naturally they'll address the safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2148.234s">So</a> I don't wanna put anything out there that we have to remove something or let's leave it to the experts and let's see what they say when they go out and take a look at it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2282.837s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2284.298s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2317.905s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2320.606s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2321.766s">I</a> want to thank all my colleagues for their work on behalf of the residents that are impacted by this Eversource project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2331.589s">This</a> project, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2333.71s">started</a> in November 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2338.973s">That's</a> when initially Eversource presented to the mayor at the time their wishes to install an underground transmission line roughly 3.2 miles through the heart of the city of Medford, which involved saw cuts, excavation, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2364.397s">installation</a> of pipe, backfill, temporary restoration, cable pulling, cable splicing, permanent restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2374.802s">And</a> that's not it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2377.743s">Residents</a> in the area for the past two, well over two years, have to deal directly with vibration from the construction, with trenching that's being dug. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2395.422s">Excavating,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2397.864s">Heavy</a> equipment noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2401.046s">Road</a> plates that cling when you drive over them constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2407.25s">Dirt</a> and debris in the air from the excavation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2412.834s">Additional</a> traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2415.476s">Fumes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2417.558s">Construction</a> noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2421.12s">And</a> to top it off, as we all heard from residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2426.058s">countless</a> sleepless nights, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2429.962s">We</a> actually had residents that had to go to a hotel because they couldn't sleep, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2437.589s">That's</a> how bad this construction got for residents in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2442.874s">Now,</a> one would say, well, look, we're getting underground transmission line that's going to benefit the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2452.444s">There's</a> zero truth to that, zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2455.926s">There</a> is zero benefit from this project to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2461.489s">This</a> has zero benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2463.91s">It</a> has all the inconvenience and problems, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2468.773s">Putting</a> that all aside, over the last two years during this construction, like I said, this process started in 2014 when we started to notify residents <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2481.56s">of</a> potential hearings and what's going to happen, and they may not be able to get out of their driveway at certain times, and all the other stuff associated with construction that lasts for years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2494.526s">The</a> city, during this process, signed a memorandum of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2501.09s">And</a> I assume it was the mayor at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2504.151s">I</a> don't know who else was in the room on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2507.533s">So</a> it was between the city and Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2511.232s">And</a> the memorandum of understanding states that the city of Medford will receive a city field engineer to monitor work activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2526.625s">So</a> during this process, they were gonna pay for someone to monitor the activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2533.602s">Sounds</a> like a regular construction site to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2537.003s">So</a> I'm not sure if that was a win for the city, but it was part of the memorandum of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2543.805s">Curb</a> to curb street restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2547.306s">So</a> imagine they came in and dug a three mile trench and then also put nine 12 by 12 cement vaults along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2557.629s">So</a> you can imagine the disruption and the digging and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2562.796s">And</a> they decided that they are going to pave curb to curb when they're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2568.422s">Isn't</a> that tremendous? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2570.284s">They</a> dig up all the street, no benefit to the city, and guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2574.068s">We're</a> going to get curb to curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2576.531s">Yippee,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2578.213s">Yippee.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2578.533s">You</a> can tell the residents after two years of construction in front of their home, they're getting a new street in front. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2584.459s">Yippee.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2586.243s">part</a> of the memorandum of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2589.065s">Three</a> ways crosswalks along the project route and a speed radar trailer for use during construction near Method High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2599.411s">For</a> use, they didn't buy it for the city, although we could use one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2604.294s">This</a> is for use during the construction time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2607.936s">How</a> magnanimous of Eversource to provide a temporary speed radar trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2614.967s">I</a> don't know why you need it in the area, because they're in such bad condition, the roads, you can't speed anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2620.909s">With</a> the metal plates, the dirt, the debris, the tar, anyone that go up and down Winthrop Street can speak for that firsthand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2629.932s">So</a> in addition, the city also signed the following projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2636.395s">Let</a> me just add, Mr. President, out of the 3.2 miles, Winthrop Street <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2643.692s">had</a> 6,400 feet, 1.2 miles of road, by far the largest residential construction site for this Eversource project, by far. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2658.063s">They</a> were the ones, Mr. President, a lot of people were impacted from traffic, surrounding areas, I understand that, surrounding roads, but they were the ones, Mr. President, that felt the digging, that had the fumes, that had the construction in front of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2674.266s">And</a> what else did they get, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2677.368s">The</a> restoration of Winthrop Circle Rotary and high street sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2683.511s">Doesn't</a> say how many high street sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2687.713s">Then,</a> Mr. President, 50,000 for the installation of 220 linear feet of sidewalk curbs, curb ramps from Lorraine Road to Smith Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2701.283s">We</a> all know where that little stretch of road is, near the high school, across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2706.707s">220</a> linear feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2710.31s">And</a> then rather than continue that, Mr. President, which makes sense, like we were just talking about paving the whole length of high street during the construction, right after that area, there are areas with no curb and no sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2727.903s">So</a> like putting a bike lane to nowhere, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2730.696s">Let's</a> put a sidewalk that doesn't lead to another sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2736.659s">So</a> all the residents are asking, Mr. President, for all this disruption, all this noise, all this inconvenience for the past two years is to extend the sidewalk that they're doing from Lorain Road to Smith Lane to include Wildwood Road to Placeland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2753.867s">Finish</a> it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2755.048s">Make</a> it a complete sidewalk, complete curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2758.85s">make</a> it so pedestrian safety comes first. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2762.994s">It's</a> a small price to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2765.456s">They're</a> saying the cost for 220 linear feet is $50,000 from Lorain Road to Smith. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2772.862s">That's</a> double it to $100,000 to go to Placeton. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2776.345s">Even</a> if you have to triple it, Mr. President, to $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2780.549s">That's</a> a small price to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2787.345s">And</a> we paid a large price as residents, as inconvenience, as traffic, as debris, as equipment left on the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2796.012s">Vibration.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2797.172s">We</a> all got the calls when homes started to shake. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2799.814s">What</a> do I do? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2803.677s">So</a> I respectfully ask, Mr. President, this contract is still ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2808.861s">And</a> the other part that I just read was in addition to the original MOU, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2816.286s">that</a> provided for the sidewalk and the rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2820.007s">And</a> I would ask, Mr. President, respectfully, and I'm gonna offer a motion tonight, on behalf of the residents of Winthrop Street, that we continue the sidewalk and install new sidewalk, curbing, curb ramps along the even side of Winthrop Street, from Wildwood Road to Placelet Road, which continues <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2844.963s">from</a> Lorraine Road to Smith Lane, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2850.386s">We</a> may have some residents that are on tonight, and I would ask if you can indulge them, Mr. President, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2857.309s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=4978.481s">Just</a> to address Mr. Cassano's concerns about who he can go to, as far as I'm concerned with the Eversource project, it should be the city engineer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=4987.908s">The</a> city engineer should be the contact person. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=4991.21s">If</a> there is a clerk of the works, that person's name should be given out, but ultimately the buck stops with the city engineer to be the communicator. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=4999.496s">Additionally,</a> Mr. President, when it comes to plowing, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5002.14s">as</a> Mr. Cassano mentioned, if they're plowing one way or another, it's helpful information when you get this from residents, because that's how the city should, you know, when they put together their plan of attack, when it comes time to snow plowing, how they address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5017.053s">So</a> this information that Mr. Cassano has given is important and it's vital that we have residents at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5023.038s">So</a> he's a thousand percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5025.36s">When</a> we have these type of projects going on, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5028.5s">The</a> neighborhood and the direct abutters should have the first say in what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5033.529s">And</a> clearly that did not happen during this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5036.675s">It's</a> after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5037.937s">that</a> neighbors are given the leaflets and the door knockers and all that stuff, Mr. President, which is not helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5044.241s">They</a> have to be at the table ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5046.362s">And</a> maybe we can address some of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5048.563s">But</a> regarding the plowing, again, you probably reached out, but it would be Brian Kerins, the head of DPW, that really should be responsible for making sure that they don't plow just one side or another, and that they move snow appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5062.211s">So</a> it really should be that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5065.242s">And</a> I would say, ultimately, the buck stops with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5069.405s">The</a> mayor runs the day-to-day operations of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5072.887s">All</a> the department heads report directly to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5075.99s">So</a> if there's a concern, the mayor should be addressing these concerns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5080.393s">And</a> I'm hoping, in a multi-million dollar project of this magnitude, when we're asking for some just minor mitigation, Mr. President, this is minor stuff to increase the length of sidewalks and curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5094.215s">that</a> this would be something that the mayor meet immediately with Eversource to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5099.759s">So</a> I'm hoping as part of the motion, Mr. President, the clerk would also send that we're requesting the mayor meet immediately to get an answer from Eversource and they can renegotiate the memorandum of understanding on behalf of the residents of that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5115.892s">Seconding</a> the form of amendment, Mr. Councilor Marks?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5288.876s">Mr.</a> President, if I can ask Tim, because as he mentioned, he is responsible for the street openings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5296.275s">Mr.</a> Engineer, if the city is not happy with the progress, not happy with the quality of construction, not happy about what's going on in the community, what's our recourse as a community to stop this project?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5375.122s">I'm</a> not asking that it be shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5376.782s">I'm</a> asking to find out what the process is, if it's a cease and desist order, or what the actual steps are, because in my opinion, in dealing with utility companies on this council for the last 20 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5389.915s">That's</a> what they understand is when you play hardball, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5394.138s">And</a> I think if the city takes a laissez-faire approach to this, and just let things proceed as usual, then they're never gonna take us serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5405.086s">So</a> I think at some point when we raise our concerns, and I'm hoping this comes from the administration about the sidewalk, that they take us serious, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5415.754s">They're</a> not gonna wanna come back to the table and renegotiate <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5419.092s">an</a> MOU, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5421.614s">If</a> we hold their feet to the fire right now, I think we'll have that leverage to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5427.598s">And</a> we experienced the same thing on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5430.92s">Another</a> utility digging up, we were talking about having sidewalks that were level with the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5438.526s">So</a> even though there was curbing, the street was done over so many times that it was as high as the curb to the sidewalk, therefore creating an insecure pedestrian pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5449.481s">And</a> we got the same feedback from the MWRA and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5454.723s">Oh,</a> it's not part of the scope of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5457.364s">Oh,</a> we can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5459.084s">We</a> can't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5460.185s">We</a> can't do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5462.005s">We</a> have to hold their feet to the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5464.406s">And</a> if it's a cease and desist order and having them stop, it's going to hit them in the pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5469.708s">That's</a> what they understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5471.408s">And</a> maybe that's what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5472.829s">That</a> doesn't worry me about a potential lawsuit or whatever else it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5478.131s">The</a> residents come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5480.069s">And</a> I think we're at a point with this project that we need to reshape the work in this project and make sure we're leading and not falling behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5488.632s">So</a> I appreciate council Scott Belly bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5491.272s">I</a> hope the mayor's on the phone tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5493.973s">We</a> see a lot of press releases, but I hope we get a press release that matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5498.355s">A</a> press release that comes out and says we're doing something positive that impacts residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5503.976s">I</a> hope we see something positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5505.597s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5506.217s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Locks.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5891.371s">So</a> the date I have for this, this was a response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5895.275s">This</a> date is March 9, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5896.456s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5897.477s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5898.518s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6210.227s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6211.207s">I</a> offered this resolution several weeks back on behalf of the residents of this community that would like to see their recycle in their trash barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6220.17s">How</a> to wash Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6222.491s">We</a> then asked waste management if they provide the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6226.893s">The</a> city came back last week and stated they do not provide waste management does not provide that type of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6234.175s">So</a> last week I was unable because it wasn't on the agenda to ask that the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6239.817s">uh,</a> hire a private contractor to come in during trash pickup and alert residents that barrels will be washed right after the trash is picked up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6251.2s">Power</a> washed in the interest of public safety, in the interest of rodent concerns, Mr. President, when you have lingering food and other smells coming from a barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6261.703s">And</a> I would ask that the city administration immediately hire a private contractor <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6267.969s">to</a> provide that service on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6271.81s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7165.905s">So</a> Mr. President, if I could, all along in this community, we've been following the governor's order. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7172.392s">And</a> we've been following the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7175.148s">And</a> we've been heard that our border health is bound by the governor's order and the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7180.07s">Now</a> the governor is saying that you can go outside without a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7183.552s">The</a> CDC is saying the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7185.373s">But</a> the city has yet to come out and say why we have to wear a mask or why we don't have to wear a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7191.215s">Are</a> they no longer following? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7192.776s">Now</a> they're coming up with their own rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7195.858s">These</a> are the questions that we need answered, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7198.319s">The</a> school committee is coming back June 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7202.323s">I</a> heard last night at their meeting, they're gonna come back in person on June 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7207.746s">And</a> there was one particular member of the school committee that spent more time figuring out how you're gonna throw residents out of the meeting that aren't wearing a mask than deciding what the rules and regulations are and social distancing and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7222.075s">But</a> they're more concerned about throwing people out of meetings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7225.877s">So</a> I don't know what direction we're going in, but we need direction from this city administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7330.983s">That's</a> why we need these.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7505.864s">Mr.</a> President, I'm aware that you met recently with the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7510.428s">Can</a> you just give us an update on where we stand with the budget?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7539.111s">Thank</a> you for your leadership, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_iFHofazjCG4/2024-11-19_iFHofazjCG4.html">City Council 05-18-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=542.07s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=542.67s">It's</a> a real honor and privilege tonight to mention the name of Frank Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=550.834s">For</a> those that do not know Frank, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=553.098s">Frank</a> was an instrumental part of this community for many, many decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=559.62s">Frank</a> Andrew was born in Worcester, Mass., and moved to Revere as a young boy, and then permanently located to his beloved Medford in 1936, living on Fulton Street for the next 80 years until his passing in 2016 at age 94. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=579.805s">Frank</a> lived in Method with his parents, Michael and Phyllis, and siblings, Anthony, Nicholas, Francis, and Lena. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=587.618s">The</a> family settled at 131 Fulton Street, a home that is still in the family today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=593.672s">A</a> few years later, Frank met his future wife, Norma Luongo, who lived a few doors down at 105 Fulton Street, and later at 115 Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=605.597s">The</a> couple married in 1946 and had one son, Chuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=611.68s">Frank</a> and Norma purchased a new home at 125 Fulton Street with his grandson, Michael, and his wife, Gwen, and their two sons currently reside today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=622.519s">To</a> complete the family's occupation of the stretch of Fulton Street, Frank built a house for his parents at 137 Fulton Street in 1956, which is now occupied by his granddaughter, Carla. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=637.214s">Frank</a> was involved in many businesses in Medford in the 1940s and 50s. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=642.416s">Among</a> other things, he owned a bicycle rental shop, opened Frank Andre's restaurant, and then was involved in Andre's Market with his family, all located on Salem Street and Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=656.961s">In</a> the early 1960s, Frank focused his attention to building when he founded the Andre Construction Company in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=666.568s">Andre</a> Construction went on to build over 300 houses, with the majority built in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=674.231s">Frank's</a> home still dominates streets like Gaston Street, Haines Street, Mitchell Ave, Andrew Street, Saunders Street, Reeder Drive, Doonan Street, Fulton Spring Road, and many, many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=688.257s">He</a> also owned many commercial properties in the city, primarily in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=694.821s">It</a> was through his building and investing in properties that he first became interested in the Dyer Building that was formerly housed the Medford Theater, located at 36 Salem Street, which had fallen into disrepair and had closed in 1964. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=713.138s">Frank</a> eventually purchased the property along with the prominent local physician, Dr. Anthony Graffio from the Hackett family in 1965 with the idea of converting the building to the then novel idea of constructing office condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=732.17s">Things</a> suddenly changed for the city of Medford, and in particular Medford Square and its merchants, on the night of November 1st, 1965, when a general round fire ravaged Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=745.946s">when</a> plans were announced a short time later to construct a new high school on Winthrop Street, Method Square had become dependent on businesses from almost 3,000 students, suddenly was facing a crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=763.462s">with</a> the square facing the reality of many businesses leaving due to the high school relocation, then Mayor Jack McGlynn approached Frank and asked him to consider renovating the dilapidated theater, building and reopening it as the cornerstone of the Medford Square community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=782.474s">Frank</a> knew nothing about the theater business, but did his investigative work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=787.776s">And</a> true to his Medford pride, and in an attempt to revitalize Medford Square, he met with Mayor Jack McGlynn and the city council and renovations began. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=798.34s">On</a> August 2nd, 1967, Frank proudly opened the newly renovated and then state-of-the-art Medford Cinema. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=807.424s">The</a> cinema opened to long lines, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=810.945s">with</a> the first two movies being Disney's Snow White and the comedy hit Never Too Late. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=818.091s">In</a> 1968, Frank opened Cinema 2 by renovating the old Colonial Hall that was located in the second floor of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=828.8s">In</a> 1969, the complex expanded to Medford Cinema 1, 2, and 3, with the opening of Cinema 3 and the then converted balcony. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=838.258s">Over</a> the next few decades, it was mission accomplished for Medford Square as long lines of patrons waited to watch their favorite movies at Medford's only theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=849.122s">Hits</a> like The Sound of Music, The Godfather, and Jaws brought thousands of people to Medford Square each week. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=860.831s">Frank</a> became well-known in the theater circles in 1970 with his innovation of Dollar Night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=868.014s">On</a> Mondays and Tuesdays patrons could pay just $1 to see the movie of their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=874.676s">This</a> spawned huge crowds and also drew the attention of the Massachusetts State Police as it was not uncommon to have traffic at a standstill on Route 93 trying to get into Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=889.697s">Local</a> businesses thrived because of the success of the cinema. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=894.38s">Carol's</a> Restaurant, Papageno's, the Pewter Pot, the Method Cafeteria, Savage's Deli, Brigham's, Baskin-Robbins, the Peking on the Mystic, the China Ocean, as well as the counters at Grant's and Woolworth's were all jam-packed before, between, and after all shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=916.491s">In</a> addition, local merchants in the square started to stay open later and began to thrive again, enjoying the many patrons of the cinema that suddenly became newfound customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=927.801s">Method</a> Square became revitalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=931.605s">Frank</a> operated the cinema for decades until the advent of the mall-style multi-screen complexes that put an end to almost all neighborhood theaters. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=942.044s">Frank's</a> other interests also included the owning of the Andre Thoroughbred Racing Stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=948.871s">Frank</a> was involved in local sports as well, serving as a long-time manager of the Hawks in the Nob Method Little League, as well as vice president of that league over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=961.503s">Frank</a> was a staunch supporter of Medford High School athletics, and his biggest joy was watching his son, Chuck, and grandchildren, Michael and Carla, participate in Medford sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=972.15s">In</a> fact, his son, Chuck, and his granddaughter, Carla, are the only father-daughter duo currently inducted into the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=982.716s">Frank's</a> family continues to make Medford their home today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=987.038s">Chuck</a> and his wife, Kathy, are both lifelong Medford residents, as are their grandchildren, Michael and Carla, and his two great-grandchildren, Leo and Miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=997.33s">Frank's</a> son Chuck is the founder of Remax Andre Realty Services in Medford Square and continues to own and operate the Andre Chiefs, formerly the Hosmer Chiefs, Medford's only semi-professional baseball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1012.715s">Kyle</a> is a teacher at Medford High School, while Michael is an executive at neighboring Assembly Row. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1018.757s">Frank's</a> contributions to the city run long and deep and are still evidenced today by his legacy and ongoing participation of his lifelong Medford family members. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1030.987s">Mr.</a> President, I respectfully ask that we as a council vote on the motion tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1038.89s">that</a> a dedication and a plaque be placed in front of 36 Salem Street, which formerly housed the Medford Cinema, honoring and recognizing Frank Andre for his unselfish dedication to the residents and business owners of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1058.718s">Mr.</a> President, you know, you hear this a lot, but I happen to know the Andre family. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1064.56s">I</a> knew Frank and his wife, his lovely wife, and Chuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1068.561s">And</a> you couldn't meet a gentler, kinder man, would be the first, Mr. President, to extend a hand if he needed, would be the first to donate, and he did many, many times, keeping Method Sports going, Mr. President, and would be the first to step forward when this community needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1087.587s">And</a> I think that's evident in what he did, Mr. President, during his part after that awful fire at Medford High School on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1098.142s">And</a> he was one of the driving forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1100.485s">There</a> were other people, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1102.548s">But</a> it's fair to say he was one of the driving forces to make the revitalization of Medford Square happen once again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1111.298s">And</a> I wish we had people like that around now, because we really could use the strong foundation, Mr. President, when it comes to <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1119.768s">looking</a> at the revitalization currently of Medford Square and the vision that was had back some 40, 50 years ago that I think would still apply now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1130.931s">Hard</a> work and vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1132.751s">And</a> that's what Frank Andre and his family was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1136.732s">So</a> it's with great pride that I ask that this be sent to the administration, Mr. President, and that a plaque and a dedication be held in the very near future on behalf of Frank Andre <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1149.475s">in</a> his commitment to the residents and business owners in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1155.517s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1422.786s">Is</a> she trying on her end, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1444.581s">It's</a> great technology.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1591.183s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1593.344s">I</a> rise today for a very sad news, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1601.387s">Fred</a> Papa Calangeli, known as Papa, passed recently, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1608.551s">Longtime</a> Methodist resident, beloved husband of Joan Domenico Calangeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1615.315s">And</a> he was a family first gentleman, always with his grandkids, always with his wife, Mr. President, and his own kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1624.7s">He</a> was a very active member of the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1627.061s">Joseph</a> community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1629.213s">a</a> longtime member of the Sons of Italy and the Elks, and he served in the Korean War. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1635.298s">That's</a> a mouthful, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1637.18s">He</a> lived many lifetimes, and he was a man of great stature. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1642.584s">He</a> owned and operated his own company as well, construction, and he specialized in masonry and underground pools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1650.971s">He</a> was a man that was always on the move, was always willing to help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1655.034s">If</a> you needed something done, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1656.544s">If</a> you needed your cement stairs fixed over, it'd be the first thing you'd do with this little barrel and a cement equipment to help out Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1665.089s">Never</a> looking for anything, but to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1667.571s">That</a> was the type of person he is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1670.553s">And</a> he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1672.514s">And</a> I would ask that we dedicate this meeting in the name of Fred Papa Colangeli, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1678.858s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1814.417s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1815.598s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1816.619s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1817.419s">I</a> wanna thank Councilor Falco for putting this on and he consistently brings it up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1824.504s">A</a> few weeks ago, I think we voted unanimously by this council to have DCI look at all the state areas in the community to pick up trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1833.972s">I</a> think we're at a point right now, Mr. President, we have so many roads in this community that involve participation from a state agency, which is DCR, that I think we have to bring them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1845.762s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1847.023s">Today,</a> I happened to take a walk in Wellington Circle across from Cappy's, and I wasn't going into the liquor store. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1853.309s">I</a> probably should have gone into the liquor store, but I wasn't going into the liquor store. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1857.032s">And</a> when I tell you, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1859.112s">really</a> take a ride by. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1860.653s">It</a> is so filthy and dirty. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1862.533s">Think</a> about everyone coming through Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1864.914s">It's</a> a disgrace with the trash and the objects that are just left out there and the overgrown grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1871.536s">It</a> really is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1873.137s">And</a> it's everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1874.937s">that</a> these state roads are, I hate to say it, that we're not seeing a consistent pickup and cutting and mowing and so forth of DCI. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1884.728s">So</a> I would ask respectfully, Mr. President, that we ask them to appear before the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1890.709s">probably</a> be nice next week because the nice weather's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1895.831s">Come</a> before the Medford City Council and be able to address what is the schedule for grass clipping, for pickup, and let them explain in every section, as Councilor Falco mentioned, you mentioned, I know Councilor Scarpelli, everyone behind this rail has mentioned, Mr. President, and have them explain what is the process and what is the schedule that they're going by. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1917.521s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1957.761s">Also</a> because these state agencies sometimes like to thumb their nose at local officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1964.466s">If</a> we can invite a state delegation as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2157.398s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2159.582s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President and my two colleagues Council beers and Council Falco, I think hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2165.391s">I</a> just would say, Mr. President, this has been an ongoing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2169.117s">And</a> if we recall, I think it was last year, maybe the year prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2172.339s">that</a> we had faculty members, we had parents come up to this very Method City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2178.923s">And</a> we had a teacher, Mrs. Castagnetti, that called to light a number of the potholes and curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2186.067s">And</a> then shortly after that, Mr. President, she actually tripped and fell on a pothole in the square and did some serious damage to herself, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2196.013s">And</a> these are very serious incidences in the community and deserve the utmost attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2202.518s">So</a> I would ask that we get a report back immediately as Councilor Falco and Councilor Bears alluded to.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2326.191s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2328.313s">Mr.</a> President, according to our sign ordinance, we don't allow movement on signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2334.377s">However,</a> this council over the years, at least as long as I've been on, we have allowed a few signs here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2341.401s">And</a> for extenuating circumstances, if you have a tough location, if the visibility is difficult, this is not one of them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2350.306s">And</a> if you drive by, you know, it's great that they give out free vacuums in there, but it looks like it is 45 octopus around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2359.892s">You</a> got all these new signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2361.673s">The</a> awnings haven't even gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2363.974s">I</a> don't know what else they want at that particular location, but I do not support movement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2370.818s">So</a> if, you know, I mean, we can have a subcommittee meeting, but I will not be supporting this based on the fact that I do not support <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2379.407s">movement</a> at this location, because I don't see any extenuating circumstance for that location, Mr. President, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3173.813s">I'm</a> ruling it out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3175.234s">I</a> want to talk about political speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3176.775s">We</a> are ruling it out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3178.636s">You're</a> retaliating against the Boston Criminal Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3181.698s">And</a> this man and the bank is public speech.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3410.098s">Good</a> evening, David McKillop 94 Rockland Road I just wanted to make mention of a couple of things that we spoke about earlier, you spoke about earlier tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3418.561s">Just</a> suggestions, the first suggestion is, even if it's doable Mr. President, if we are having issues with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3426.502s">making</a> sure that their roads are clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3428.203s">Is</a> it possible that we could actually take the step to actually do it ourselves and charge the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3433.026s">Is</a> this something that can be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3434.187s">Because</a> why should the city be penalized for their ineffectiveness? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3438.769s">Why</a> can't we just get it done and then charge them? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3442.651s">That's</a> something that I think that we should look at and forcibly make that happen.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3486.271s">Well,</a> that becomes an actual administrative and budget issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3489.892s">And</a> that's a totally different thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3491.092s">But</a> speaking about budget issues, we're talking about schools and how their maintenance issues are a huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3496.913s">And</a> they've been a continual issue for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3499.433s">And</a> there's no denying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3500.713s">In</a> fact, when the McGlynn was built, there was supposed to be money put aside for maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3505.974s">And</a> that obviously went into the general fund from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3509.975s">Are</a> we going to hold the administrative accountable for line items to get that maintenance <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3516.017s">out</a> there and really structure so we can get these things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3519.999s">Those</a> are some suggestions that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3521.499s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3522.42s">Thank</a> you, Mr. McKillop. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3523.4s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3524.581s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3525.901s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. McKillop brings up a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3529.943s">And</a> in this city, we have an ordinance called the clean it or lean it ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3534.785s">So</a> the city of Medford, if they don't like how you clean your property or maintain your property, they can go in there, put a lean on your property and hire an outside contractor to clean your property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3546.734s">But</a> here we have a state agency that can leave their roads in deplorable condition, can leave them unkept, Mr. President, and there's no recourse we have as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3557.221s">So</a> I agree with Mr. McKillop that there should be something, some type of recourse that we have to say, you know, enough's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3565.125s">And</a> the cleaner the cleaner, I don't know if the state would fall back on our local ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3570.749s">You</a> know, the residents are at our mercy, but I'm not sure the state would, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3576.134s">He</a> brings up a valid point and so does Vice President Knight about maybe in the spirit of cooperation, that we can sign some type of agreement that would enable us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3588.339s">I've</a> said that for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3589.659s">If</a> you live on a state road right now and want your tree trimmed, you've got to go to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3594.822s">If</a> you live on a state road, you want your sidewalk done, you have to go to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3598.901s">And</a> it's an act of Congress to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3601.882s">You're</a> paying the same tax as someone else that doesn't live on a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3606.124s">So</a> there's no benefit of living on a state road other than the fact that you have to chase the state to do stuff on your street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3614.087s">So,</a> you know, I've been saying this for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3616.908s">I</a> would personally like to see the city take over all these roads, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3621.432s">and</a> have us accountable to the residents because the residents know us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3625.855s">They</a> don't know these people in DCR or in these other state agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3629.438s">They</a> know the people here and the local officials and the local government. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3633.161s">And</a> I think it's a much better approach to have us responsible rather than some state agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3638.524s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3640.286s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4468.333s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4474.395s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4475.495s">And</a> I want to thank Jean's family for coming up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4478.836s">You</a> know, Jean's name made it to the final 18 because of what Jean did in this community and the number of people she impacted over the many decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4493.992s">and</a> her public service to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4498.295s">So</a> it is a fitting tribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4500.976s">And</a> I think it speaks volumes that Jean is a finalist because of her past, Mr. President, and what made her such a great person in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4512.342s">You</a> know, one thing I can recall, and this is going back many, many years ago, when I was first elected to the school committee, I was a real youngster at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4523.018s">And</a> we had our first negotiations with the Teachers Association and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4531.485s">And</a> we'd sit in separate rooms, I don't know if it's still done the same way, we'd sit in separate rooms and we'd go back and forth, volley back and forth with, this is what we're gonna offer you, this is what we want you to give up, back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4543.935s">And</a> it got so contentious, Mr. President, for several days, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4549.798s">wasn't</a> until Gene Barry stood up and said, why don't we meet in the same room together? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4555.684s">You</a> know, what a novel idea, bring people together, rather than have them in separate rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4560.949s">And</a> you know what happens when you're in separate rooms, you're tougher in separate rooms, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4565.333s">And</a> you want to play hard guy when you're in separate rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4568.195s">And</a> when we Gene brought us together, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4571.461s">And</a> the words still went back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4573.482s">Guess</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4574.343s">It</a> was Gene Barry that stood up and said, we need to do this, not just for the teachers and the administrators, but for the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4582.828s">And</a> that really struck home to a lot of people, Mr. President, because we said, let's put politics aside, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4589.314s">And</a> it was Gene that stood up and brought us together and made for a successful negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4594.858s">And</a> that was my very first, really, my very first introduction to what I'd say is politics in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4601.965s">And</a> it was Gene that stood up <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4604.215s">to</a> bring people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4605.576s">And</a> she did that over her whole career. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4608.157s">If</a> you ever saw Jean in the street, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, she'd be walking with her and her husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4613.88s">They'd</a> be out there in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4615.902s">She'd</a> wave to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4616.642s">She'd</a> say hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4617.502s">She'd</a> take a second to talk to you, even if she was on a power walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4620.724s">That</a> was the type of person Jean was. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4623.406s">It</a> was in her heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4624.466s">There</a> wasn't a phony bone in her body. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4627.668s">That's</a> who Jean was. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4629.189s">You</a> couldn't change who Jean was. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4631.269s">And</a> Mr. President, I think what I'm hoping happens during this process is that the 18 names that came up, Mr. President, they'll probably be vetted out, they'll be looked at, Mr. President, and they'll be discussed on merit, Mr. President, not on other circumstances that may become political or may be used as a political tool, but from the circumstance of the person's life and what that person did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4659.096s">And</a> clearly, Gene Barry, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4661.633s">represents</a> everything that this community stands for. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4665.174s">And</a> I think everyone would be honored if that's the case, to have Gene Barry's name on the school, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4671.636s">Everyone</a> would be honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4676.378s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4677.158s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.

<a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4807.459s">It</a> really isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4808.88s">This</a> whole Columbus school is devastating, it's tearing the city apart, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4818.024s">It</a> should have never happened, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4821.826s">It</a> became an issue, it was brought up, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4825.622s">regardless</a> of all the signatures and the 1,200 or 1,300 people that didn't want the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4833.368s">I</a> think I speak for a lot of people, Italian Americans, when I say that we would be honored, honored to have Jeannie. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4843.695s">But</a> how could we possibly believe after what was said by two members and the person that appointed them <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4856.223s">to</a> that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4858.605s">How</a> can we believe it's a fair process? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4861.928s">I'm</a> asking somebody, this whole process, okay, should be just, this committee needs to be, to just go away, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4870.155s">Because</a> Gene would win by a landslide, but that's not the way it's gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4875.639s">I</a> mean, look at the 18 finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4878.061s">Gene's</a> got, I don't know the exact numbers, 130, closest person to her got 20 votes, 25 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4886.443s">but</a> I can almost guarantee you that when, and it's unfortunate, but when it comes down to it, we all know what's going on with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4896.467s">I</a> have nothing against nobody. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4898.767s">I</a> really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4900.268s">It's</a> good to see you all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4901.868s">And</a> it's, you know, like I said, I love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4904.729s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4906.43s">And</a> there's a lot of other things I wanted to bring up tonight, but this has got to be for Jean and Jean only tonight in the Columbus school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4915.803s">There</a> was also comments made about white Italian Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4922.49s">Those</a> were the only ones that voted for Jeanne. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4925.994s">And</a> we don't know how she treated black children. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4931.98s">That's</a> what was said. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4935.224s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4937.168s">I'm</a> just disgusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4938.969s">You</a> won't get a person anywhere in the city to say anything bad about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4944.112s">Yet</a> we have people on that committee had the nerve to say those words, to put them on a post. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4954.779s">They</a> need to be taken off that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4956.9s">That</a> whole committee should be just completely <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4962.415s">You</a> know, it just needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4965.796s">Someone's</a> gotta stand up and speak for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4971.157s">Somebody</a> has to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4973.497s">It</a> has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4976.797s">The</a> Columbus School name change is a fuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4980.878s">Everyone</a> in Medford knows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4987.119s">You</a> know, in the old days, we'd call it a bag job. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4990.16s">And</a> that's what this is.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5008.245s">The</a> mayor is silent, everyone's silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5012.886s">Everybody,</a> the human rights commission, denigrating the American flag, the police chief, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5020.069s">The</a> mayor... Okay, we're getting up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5022.791s">I'm</a> just saying it's silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5025.773s">It's</a> silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5026.454s">It's</a> got to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5027.434s">And</a> this is where it's got to end with this Columbus school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5030.777s">Someone</a> has to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5033.058s">I</a> don't know who can do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5035.48s">But</a> this committee needs to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5038.282s">It</a> does. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5039.543s">It</a> needs to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5043.326s">And</a> I'm sure you guys are all aware of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5046.807s">So</a> I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5049.487s">Nothing</a> else I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5057.869s">Any</a> further discussion?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5403.005s">I</a> don't disagree with Vice President Knight, but I think what you're hearing tonight is a sense of frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5409.932s">This</a> council has always been the only forum that people can come up and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5416.818s">And</a> over the last year and a half, Mr. President, the school committee, you can only see them on Zoom, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5427.578s">Mr.</a> President, and I think we have to maintain that this is the forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5433.04s">There</a> may be things said that we don't want to hear tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5436.161s">There</a> may be things that go off topic, but this is the forum, this is the people's forum, and we have to allow people the ability to come up and say things that may rub us the wrong way, we may agree with, but they have the right to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5451.246s">And</a> once we stifle that-
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5466.157s">You</a> got to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5467.057s">We</a> don't have the power to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5467.997s">I</a> agree a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5470.198s">But</a> what I just want to make sure is that, you know, it's been a year and a half where people were unable to come up and address their public officials, Mr. President, face to face. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5480.78s">And</a> there's a lot said about being face to face than being on Zoom, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5485.985s">And</a> I think now what we're seeing is people want to get out, they want to voice their opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5491.149s">And</a> I think this needs to be the forum, because if we stifle it, there is no other forum in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5497.415s">So</a> we have to maintain <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5498.936s">this</a> as the ability for people to have a mechanism to vent their concerns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5503.9s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5505.501s">We</a> have no bearing on a school committee vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5509.003s">We</a> have zero bearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5510.684s">You</a> know, if they want to rename the school and set up the committees, really, the only bearing we have is November. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5517.809s">If</a> people want to make change, November's the time to make change, if you want to make change.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7037.577s">I</a> don't know, I'm at a loss here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7039.839s">I</a> mean, to me, this is just, it's sad that this school committee and the committee that they assigned, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7052.109s">is</a> going to get away with this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7068.302s">I'm</a> not questioning you guys have a tough job. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7070.784s">No</a> one's questioning that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7071.985s">We</a> know what's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7073.086s">We</a> know it's a tough year with the budget and we know everything else, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7078.931s">you</a> know, just to have this procedure, it's just that it breaks my heart that this is going to happen and that's all.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7113.862s">Let</a> me get an argument from anyone in the city about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7119.006s">We</a> appreciate you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7120.508s">And</a> like I said, we know what you do, but understand the frustration <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7127.385s">And</a> us knowing that this is, I mean, it's a scam is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7132.148s">They're</a> pulling off a scam. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7134.89s">I</a> hate to say it, but that's what it is, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7138.152s">Horrible</a> words to use, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7140.553s">And</a> I don't like using them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7141.954s">But</a> that's basically what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7143.655s">So</a> there's nothing we can do.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8889.363s">Mr.</a> President, if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8892.865s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8894.365s">We</a> received in our packet our correspondence regarding resolution 21-336 from the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8902.15s">This</a> is dated May 6th, and it's regarding my resolution that was offered two weeks ago about seeing if waste management could provide the residents a service of washing or power washing their recycle and their trash bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8917.243s">And</a> this is the response we received from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8920.686s">It</a> says waste management does not have the resources to perform the requested service of washing the cots. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8928.897s">per</a> waste management, they have not been asked to wash cots for any other community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8933.7s">Instead,</a> residents are instructed to rinse their cots with a hose and let dry in the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8940.505s">Spraying</a> the interior with a cleaner, like a simple green, before washing will help the cots that are excessively dirty, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8949.651s">So</a> this is a multi-multi-million dollar corporation, Mr. President, that doesn't have the whereabouts on a multi-multi <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8958.309s">million</a> dollar yearly contract to assist residents on barrels that may, after many years, have a stink to them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8968.354s">And</a> you're asking senior citizens, disabled people, and other people, Mr. President, in this community, to take a barrel that's four and a half feet tall, that weighs some 35 pounds, and flip it over and wash it out, Mr. President, I think is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8984.283s">So</a> I would respectfully ask <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8986.084s">that</a> the administration, where they failed to convince waste management that this is a good idea on behalf of the 58,000 residents of this community, that the city now find a contractor, Mr. President, at their dime to find out <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9004.967s">who</a> would come out and clean, Mr. President, go around like they pick up the trash, they can go around and clean these barrels up, Mr. President, on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9015.679s">And</a> I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that the city seek out another vendor if waste management is not willing to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9024.112s">to</a> clean the barrels throughout the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9038.263s">Cracked</a> the barrels in half.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9044.968s">I</a> will hold on to it, maybe if the motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9048.31s">That's</a> fine, that's fine, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9050.692s">Councilor</a> Behr has offered a motion, Councilor Scarpelliic second. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9053.899s">The</a> motion to adjourn by Councilor Beall. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9055.72s">Wait</a> a second, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9057.001s">We</a> do have someone that just came up that wasn't in the room.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9060.724s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9061.605s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9062.125s">Name</a> and address of the record, please.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=402.8s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=404.583s">And</a> I put this on the agenda tonight because of the number of phone calls I've taken and the number of emails I've received, Mr. President, over the last several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=417.058s">This</a> by no stretch is a new issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=420.782s">in</a> this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=422.143s">And</a> I wanna thank my colleagues, Vice President Knight, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Falco and President Caraviello over the years, I know have put resolutions on regarding the poor condition of our roads and what capital plan will we have to assist us in a systematic approach to repaving our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=450.098s">And</a> to date, Mr. President, I think it's clear to state that we have no systematic approach to repaving our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=459.46s">The</a> mayor recently put together a capital plan which does include paving the roads, but that's the last I heard about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=469.562s">I</a> haven't heard anything else, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=472.122s">And</a> over the years, there's been a lot of talk, a lot of lip service, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=476.323s">but</a> no formalized plan to address the over 719 streets in this community, which are broken down by 500, I'm sorry, 450 city streets and 269 private ways in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=488.369s">So</a> we have over 719 streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=491.07s">And</a> currently right now, Mr. President, what we put into the actual city budget <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=505.187s">to</a> repave streets, not to fix potholes, to repave streets is a big fat goose egg. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=513.33s">That's</a> what we put in our city budget every year to repave streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=518.752s">We</a> do rely on chapter 90 funding, which on a given year, we get roughly about $980,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=525.634s">I</a> can tell you firsthand, Mr. President, over the past four and a half years, we repaved <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=535.007s">nine</a> streets out of 719 in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=540.491s">Those</a> were full streets that were paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=543.714s">And</a> we partially paved another 21 streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=547.957s">So</a> even at best, if we said there were 30 streets done, Mr. President, in the last five years, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=556.963s">And</a> if you look at it, the life expectancy of a road, and depending on the maintenance and how you keep up, depending on the traffic, depending on if you allow heavy trucking on streets, the life expectancy of a street can vary. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=573.052s">But</a> typically, you're looking at a little over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=576.975s">So</a> if you look at doing 30 streets every five years, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=584.744s">After</a> 20 years, you'll have paved 120 streets, which is 28% of the 450 streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=597.657s">And</a> that doesn't include private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=600.78s">So</a> if you take that into consideration, Mr. President, we are never going to get ahead of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=607.787s">will</a> always be repaving and never have an approach where someday we can be proud and say, look at our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=615.184s">They're</a> in beautiful, pristine condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=619.023s">but</a> we have no such plan, Mr. President, of addressing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=623.447s">And</a> that doesn't even count the 269 private ways, which is about 40% of all the streets we have in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=633.335s">So</a> I offer this tonight, Mr. President, because I think when you look at a community, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=640.734s">And</a> you look at the livability. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=643.496s">You</a> look at how vibrant a community is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=646.078s">You</a> look at how well it's taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=648.339s">You</a> look at how city government operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=651.241s">I</a> think it says a lot about a community when you see streets that are torn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=656.305s">There</a> was a street right next to me, Bradbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=659.927s">They</a> just did a gas line, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=662.289s">And</a> we see this all too often. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=664.35s">They</a> dug maybe a four or five foot trench, two feet wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=670.315s">And</a> it goes up the entire length of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=673.958s">And</a> I asked whether or not they're going to do curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=677.08s">And</a> I was told, oh, absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=679.002s">That</a> wasn't part of the recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=682.725s">And</a> what they are going to do, Mr. President, is just refill that trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=688.571s">So</a> if you had a driveway or a new driveway and you allowed someone to come in at no fault of your own and dig up your driveway, you would expect to get your driveway repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=700.177s">Not</a> a patch job, which after a few years, if you're lucky, starts to sink. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=706.523s">and</a> then there's mix match and it creates craters and potholes and a lot of other concerns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=714.311s">So</a> I ask that we find out from the administration, even though we did get a correspondence regarding this capital plan, if we can get an in-depth report on what's going to be done with the roads <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=729.976s">Mr.</a> President, also today there was an announcement that there was $37.4 million that's going to be coming to the city of Medford from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=742.425s">I</a> realize there's still ironing out and hashing out what it can be spent on over how many years and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=749.63s">But</a> we have to find out before we do any budgeting if that money can be spent on capital needs, which I believe it can, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=760.018s">and</a> I would prefer it be spent on capital needs one-time cost in the community and our roads should be at the top of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=770.608s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President that in the form of a motion that we find out more in depth about the mayor's capital plan for the refurbishing of our roads <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=781.238s">I</a> would ask that the $37.4 million I believe that came out today, if that could be used to fund new roads in the community, infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=793.122s">And</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that we come up with a systematic approach to addressing our roads that will one day have us see all our roads done over a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=806.506s">and</a> not just 15 to 20, and then 15 to 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=810.888s">And</a> by the time you get to that second 15 to 20, the first 15 to 20 you go back to, because it's 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=818.392s">So</a> it makes no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=820.693s">And</a> I'd put that in the form of a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=822.673s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1162.772s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1165.113s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1166.333s">Just</a> while we're on the subject, because it's somewhat related, I'm not going to offer it tonight, but in addition to the streets, Mr. President, all you have to do is take a walk around the neighborhood and see the hundreds of old tree stumps that are lined on our streets, up and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1184.578s">I'd</a> venture to say there's thousands in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1187.979s">I've</a> done a count just in my neighborhood alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1190.32s">And</a> there's literally 30 or 40 just on abutting streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1195.163s">And</a> you can tell they've been cut down for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1197.664s">This</a> is not new stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1199.365s">These</a> have been stumps that have been around for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1201.686s">And</a> this council has asked, Mr. President, about the stump list. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1205.307s">And</a> in the past, we've got, well, here's a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1207.709s">Then</a> we get a partial list, not a full list. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1210.43s">And</a> then we got an indication a couple of years back that they went through 90% of the stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1217.013s">Where?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1218.073s">Where?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1218.593s">They're</a> all around the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1221.154s">So</a> tree stumps, raised sidewalks, trip and fall hazards everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1226.475s">Someone</a> just sent me a photo of a woman that fell over the weekend in the square, busted her nose open wide, Mr. President, on a sidewalk that was slanted up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1236.196s">But</a> this exists everywhere, Mr. President, throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1239.417s">Rose</a> is part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1241.017s">Broken</a> sidewalks, tree stumps, double poles, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1244.918s">It</a> speaks volumes about a community and a community that cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1249.379s">And,</a> you know, you take a look around this community and, you know, I hate to say it, but it looks like no one cares, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1256.361s">And</a> we got to do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1257.441s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1258.142s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1260.002s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1554.311s">Mr.</a> President, just if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1557.692s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1558.753s">While</a> we're on the tree stump subject, I'd like to put a motion forward that the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1567.685s">do</a> a thorough walkthrough of the city and give us an exact count of the number of tree stumps, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1577.411s">Because</a> I don't think they have an understanding on how many are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1581.734s">And</a> then we can address it this year's budget because it's actually gonna be a budget of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1586.741s">Councilor</a> Knights, absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1589.165s">You</a> had people in this community that paid a very high tax, Mr. President, and not receiving the city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1595.654s">Do</a> you wanna make that a big paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1597.176s">Yes,</a> I'd like to make it a big paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1599.198s">And</a> when you can use these particular stumps and double poles as a reference, when you tell someone to take a left at the double pole and then take a right at the tree stump that's been there a hundred years, you know, they've been around a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1613.943s">So</a> I think Mr. President, we have to get a handle on the number and address it in this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1619.586s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1620.646s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1688.775s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1690.716s">May</a> 9th through May 15th is National Police Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1696.277s">I</a> offer this resolution tonight to honor one of Method's very own and Method's very finest. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1702.839s">On</a> May 13th, 2021, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1706.26s">Harold</a> McGillivray Jr.' <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1707.542s">'s</a> name will be placed on the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C., along with another 22,611 heroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1718.572s">The</a> memorial was established to tell the story of American law enforcement and to honor the fallen who protect and serve, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1731.19s">Harold</a> F. McGillivray Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1733.332s">was</a> appointed to the Medford Police Department on May 31st, 1964, and served with distinction until his later appointment to the Metropolitan District Commission Police Department on December 1st, 1967, and then was signed to the Old Colony District in South Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1756.975s">Harold</a> McGillivray, during a routine traffic stop on the Southeast Expressway on November 13th, 1978, at approximately 1.40 a.m., was struck by a vehicle at a high rate of speed and was rushed to the University Hospital, where a team of four doctors began a 13 and a half hour life-saving operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1785.088s">Post-surgery</a> patrolman McGillivray spent 13 days in the intensive care unit before being placed on the cardiac floor for the next four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1796.991s">Officer</a> McGillivray would spend the next several years in and out of the hospital undergoing additional procedures as a result of his injuries sustained during the traffic stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1811.039s">Patrolman</a> McGillivray eventually made it back to his beloved job at DDC police and was forced to retire on December 31st, 1984 due to injuries sustained in the line of duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1828.603s">Patrolman</a> Howard McGillivray, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1830.243s">served</a> the residents of Method and the Commonwealth with honor and distinction for over 20 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1841.772s">Harold</a> McGillivray, Jr., a debt of gratitude for his service, not only to the citizens of Medford, but to the residents of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1854.276s">Anyone</a> that knew Harold knew he was a man of integrity, a man of faith, a man who loved his family, and a man who took his job very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1869.605s">If</a> you were in need, Harold McGillivray Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1873.167s">would</a> be the first at your doorstep, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1878.091s">That</a> was the type of person he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1882.954s">We</a> have his brave son now serving in the Method Police Department and is our dog officer and does a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1892.36s">Harold</a> McGillivray Jr., he didn't need a dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1896.803s">He</a> was the bulldog. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1899.521s">Anyone</a> that knew him, he was tough as nails, but he had a heart of gold, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1904.083s">He'd</a> be the first to step forward and help. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1907.105s">And</a> this is a huge honor to have his name placed on the monument in Washington, D.C., with 22,611 other heroes that protect every day the citizens of Method, put their life on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1924.192s">to</a> do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1925.853s">And</a> as I stated last week, for one of our state police officers that retired after three decades, Mr. President, I say the same about Harold McGilvery Jr., a man that was dedicated, a man that cared about his community more than anything else, and someone that should be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1951.363s">And</a> I ask that this meeting, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1954.213s">be</a> named in honor of Harold McGillivray Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1958.034s">for</a> his commitment to this community and the residents of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1962.615s">And</a> I want to show our appreciation for having his name placed on the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, DC, which is going to happen on the 13th, which is this Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1975.318s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1976.298s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4513.405s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4514.465s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4517.166s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4518.446s">Make</a> no mistake about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4520.766s">A</a> vote to merge the director of diversity <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4524.562s">human</a> resource director is a vote to take a step backwards regarding diversity in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4531.247s">Make</a> no bones about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4532.928s">Councilor</a> Falco was a thousand percent correct, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4537.192s">A</a> vote tonight to support that will be a vote to do away with the director, a standalone director position that has existed for years in this community with the sole responsibility of looking at diversity through a lens of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4553.28s">and</a> the people that live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4555.221s">So</a> in my opinion, it's taking a step, a giant step backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4559.303s">This</a> council also met within the past year, Mr. President, seven of us and discussed and put together a list of priorities that we voted on unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4569.607s">And</a> one of the votes was not to merge this position, it was to keep a standalone diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4577.921s">That</a> was a vote seven zero, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4580.882s">So,</a> you know, we've been consistent on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4583.743s">If</a> others want to flip flop back and forth, that's their call, but we've been consistent on this issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4590.344s">And</a> now's the time to stand up against the administration and say, this is far too important of a position to have it go by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4598.787s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4600.367s">Councilor</a> Bearsley.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4948.415s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4951.076s">Mr.</a> President, and I appreciate we have the finance director on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4955.719s">In</a> the past, in this finance director, Alicia has been around for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4959.041s">There's</a> always been discussion about tapping into our, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4962.857s">retained</a> earnings or free cash because it may impact the bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4968.199s">I</a> was just wondering at what point in this particular account, if we were to vote for a higher dollar amount, would that impact our bond rating? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4982.472s">or</a> the potential of our impact?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5020.942s">Right,</a> so if I could, Alicia, what do we anticipate every year of additional funds to retained earnings?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5069.307s">I</a> understand that, but this account grows every year, sitting on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5076.431s">So</a> I'm trying to anticipate once we use 500,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5080.958s">It's</a> currently $6,059,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5083.4s">That'll</a> leave us with about $5,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5086.603s">What</a> do we anticipate this time next year having in the account?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5135.596s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5136.156s">And</a> I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5138.513s">I</a> can tell you firsthand that this amount of money is not gonna ease much off the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5144.816s">I</a> think it's a good symbolic gesture, but it's really not gonna ease the feelings of the rate payers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5152.979s">And</a> if anything, the 6 million that's out there, as you stated, is an overreach of the city charging too much for water and sewer, and that's how we end up with the retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5168.5s">But</a> putting that aside, there's been some discussion recently, and I brought up the issue within the last couple of weeks about our water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5181.843s">And</a> this discussion has been that we're close to the life expectancy of the water meters that were installed some years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5190.864s">And</a> is the administration, if you can't answer this, I understand, it's not under your jurisdiction, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5196.612s">Is</a> the administration currently looking at water meters within the community for replacement?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5209.041s">So</a> is there potential that the retained earnings, which could be a one-time cost for infrastructure, be looked at for the replacement of water meters?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5232.534s">DPW</a> or the water and sewer commissions?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5242.84s">Right,</a> but who would ultimately approve the new meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5246.022s">Would</a> it be the water and sewer commissioners?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5256.566s">Right,</a> so the recommendation doesn't come from the Water and Sewer Commissioners?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5293.653s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5294.474s">So</a> that's, you know, when I was on the council, when we last replaced the water meters and the water and sewer commissioners were an integral part, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5304.287s">of</a> the replacement, along with the DPW, you are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5309.653s">So</a> my, you know, one concern is that if we don't request more money for retained earnings to offset the increase, we're at 3% now with the 500,000, then if we are gonna use this for new water meters, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5326.03s">which</a> I think we all can remember the time and Councilor Penta brought it up a couple of weeks ago about the number of abatements. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5332.875s">I</a> believe it was over 700 abatements given in one calendar year because we were estimating over half of our water and sewer bills because of malfunctioning meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5344.484s">We</a> never want to go back to that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5348.107s">So</a> if we can get some type of commitment from the administration that the funds will be taken out of this account <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5356.499s">I</a> will not look to further tap this account because I think in general, it's going to ultimately save the rate payers by having an accurate meter and it serves the same purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5372.887s">So</a> at this point, I'm not gonna have an additional dollar amount as long as we know that the money is coming from these particular funds for the new meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5382.751s">And</a> I guess at some point, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5384.416s">the</a> mayor is going to ask for an appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5386.197s">So</a> it will require a council approval, but I just want to go on record that that's what I would be supporting at this point.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7966.308s">President,</a> I have time to review the records and ask that they be reviewed next week.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_FOGKQdOAGpI/2024-11-19_FOGKQdOAGpI.html">City Council 05-04-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1602.623s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1603.604s">I</a> wholeheartedly agree with Vice President Knight, but I remember at the public hearing and someone can correct me if I'm wrong, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1612.062s">the</a> mayor was gonna supplement the decrease in funding and the community block grant money with money in the FY22 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1621.85s">Is</a> that not correct, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1627.314s">So</a> we did receive a commitment and maybe Alicia can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1631.878s">Was</a> that a commitment that was made by the city administration?

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1774.767s">So</a> it requires a vote tonight to put into it for a 30 day comment period?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2197.072s">Rita</a> Lennox has been a fixture in this community for a number of years, and Councilor Knight is absolutely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2203.694s">Rita</a> was very involved in the community and someone that was instrumental and volunteered our services for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2210.776s">I</a> had the opportunity to work with Rita at the Registry of Deeds back some years ago, and indeed, she ran the Registry of Deeds as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2221.539s">So</a> Rita, in whatever capacity, was always a leader and still is a leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2226.177s">and</a> I wanna congratulate her reaching her 90th birthday, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2230.719s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2848.519s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2850.0s">I</a> rise tonight to honor one of our very own, Mr. President, and that is Detective Lieutenant Richard Mahoney, a lifelong Method resident, someone that if you know him, Mr. President, you'll know that he loves this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2868.334s">He</a> loves his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2870.374s">And,</a> you know, he's a gentleman that served with distinction for 34 years to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2880.136s">He</a> was a gentleman that served in very trying times, Mr. President, and has had an unblemished career for 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2889.638s">I</a> think that speaks volumes on the type of person that Rich Mahoney is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2896.82s">He</a> finished his <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2898.367s">illustrious</a> career as detective lieutenant with the Massachusetts State Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2904.031s">Every</a> day, Mr. President, going to work, putting his life on the line to protect and serve the residents of this commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2912.896s">And</a> he did it with honor and respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2916.499s">And</a> I think that says a lot about his character, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2921.742s">Rich</a> was also very highly respected by his peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2927.6s">And</a> as he rose through the ranks, Mr. President, he got there through hard work and dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2934.065s">And</a> his commitment to this commonwealth, I believe, goes unmatched. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2938.769s">And</a> in this day and age, you hear a lot about police, about defunding the police, about police this, police that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2948.497s">And</a> it's fair to say that Rich Mahoney is one of the 99.999% <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2956.895s">of</a> police officers that get up every day, serve the public, Mr. President, do a tremendous job, put their life on the line every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2966.678s">There's</a> not many professions you can say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2969.279s">Police,</a> fire, are a few that come to mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2973.721s">And</a> that's every day, not knowing if you're gonna come home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2978.263s">And,</a> you know, I really believe that, you know, when our officers retire, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2985.573s">they</a> shouldn't just go out with a thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2987.594s">They</a> should go out with a warm welcome and thank you from the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2992.797s">And</a> I wanna thank Detective Lieutenant Richard Mahoney on behalf of the residents of this community, on behalf of the residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3004.564s">And</a> I wanna also thank him, Mr. President, for being the family man he is, because with Rich, family comes first. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3012.809s">And</a> I wanna thank him for all his years of dedication <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3015.821s">and</a> ask that the city clerk send a citation to honor his career on behalf of the Commonwealth and the residents of this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3027.727s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3030.148s">Vice</a> President Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3101.453s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3101.873s">Mr.</a> President, I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention his lovely wife, Marianne. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3110.097s">And</a> Marianne's the one that got him up for work every day, combed his hair, laid out the clothes on the bed, laid out his uniform, and got him to work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3121.102s">And</a> I want to thank Marianne, Mr. President, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3124.463s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3185.397s">Mr.</a> President, I'll be brief on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3187.659s">This</a> was what was brought up last week under community participation by former city councilor Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3194.903s">I</a> think it speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3196.124s">We're</a> asking for whether or not the city still looks at acceptor reports, which are reports that show a spike in the usage of water throughout the community so we can notify residents if they do have a leak within their home or on their property that they're unaware of, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3215.305s">and</a> being charged, so I move approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3478.651s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3481.835s">Uh,</a> just if I could follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3483.957s">I</a> appreciate Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3485.579s">He</a> always brings reason to a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3490.488s">Mr.</a> President, I think that was the whole, if we recall back so many years ago, as Mr. Castagnetti mentioned some 18 years ago, the whole intent for this system was to draw out any exceptions that we have throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3507.553s">And</a> it's not that, you know, that we're waiting till something happens and then after the fact say, okay, we just throw money at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3516.055s">This</a> was to be proactive and say, we're aware that this spike <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3520.205s">spikes</a> within your account. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3522.206s">And</a> there may be a leak because ultimately what happens is we don't just forgive a bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3527.727s">So</a> even if someone gets an abatement, guess who's paying for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3531.168s">It's</a> the rest of the rate payers that are paying for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3534.189s">So</a> the whole logic behind this was to get these spikes ahead of time so we don't have to pay, whether it's through the surplus money, as Mr. Castagnetti mentioned, over 5 million, or not approving the abatement and having the resident pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3550.233s">That</a> was the whole anticipation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3552.073s">And</a> I think what was brought up by Councilor Penta was 100% correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3555.774s">If</a> that's a service that we pay for, we want to know, indeed, is someone looking at this daily? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3561.316s">If</a> so, how many people have been notified in the last year regarding spikes in their water? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3567.798s">How</a> many snowbirds may be in Florida and don't realize they have a leak for four or five months? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3572.96s">This</a> is very costly. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3574.721s">And</a> if we can work on behalf of the residents through this reporting, then I think we're obligated to do so, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3581.908s">and</a> I appreciate Mr. Castagnetti coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3584.17s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Markswell.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3628.582s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3629.623s">This</a> was another issue that was brought up by Councilor Penter under <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3635.435s">community</a> participation last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3637.877s">We</a> couldn't take a vote on it, Mr. President, because our new rules require that it appear on the following agenda for proper notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3644.823s">So</a> that's why it appears tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3647.184s">Mr.</a> President, I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3650.167s">I</a> believe from what we were told that the current city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3654.48s">is</a> actually looking at the life expectancy of our existing meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3659.204s">As</a> I spoke last week, we purchased meters back some 18 to 20 years ago because the city was estimating over 50%, 50% of our bills, water and sewer bills, were being estimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3675.239s">And</a> that's not a way to operate a city, because your bill could either, you could be good and get a lower bill, or you could be on the other end where they're charging the extra of water that you're actually not using. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3686.671s">And</a> the best way to do it, Mr. President, is to have an accurate and fair bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3691.196s">And</a> that's why we went to new meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3693.198s">And</a> we never want to go down that path again where we had hundreds, I think it was 750 in a year span of abatements that residents, 750 residents came forward and said there was a problem with their water and sewer bill, the way it was being tabulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3709.427s">And</a> we never want to experience that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3711.768s">So</a> I'm hoping that the city administration moves forward with notifying this council on what the next steps are to look at our <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3722.138s">aging</a> water meters to make sure we never experienced what we did back some years ago.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3805.095s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3805.856s">Council</a> Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3806.736s">I</a> can't miss an opportunity to speak about INI. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3809.997s">And</a> the council vice president's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3812.957s">It's</a> been two decades that I've been speaking about inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3817.838s">And</a> it's not a sexy issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3820.379s">Underground,</a> like I always say, out of sight, out of mind, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3824.753s">But</a> Mr. President, over the years, we've talked dating back so many years ago that someday your water and sewer bill will be higher than your tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3834.118s">And</a> we're approaching the point where it's getting in that realm. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3838.26s">It</a> may not be that close, but it's getting in that realm. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3841.322s">And</a> residents will always say, how can we lower our water and sewer rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3845.044s">And</a> there's really not many ways, Mr. President, other than looking at the infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3850.527s">And</a> INI is all it is, is water that's seeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3854.289s">This</a> is rainwater that's seeping into the ground and then finding its way into our sewer system, through cracks, through holes and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3862.993s">That</a> water, which is just rain runoff water, which typically goes into the Mystic River, now is going out to Deer Island and being treated as raw sewage at a great expense to the taxpayers and rate payers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3877.38s">Multi-million</a> dollars a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3879.684s">goes</a> to INI. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3881.104s">I</a> lost check. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3881.765s">I</a> think it was about 45 to 50% of INI in our community is through infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3890.268s">And</a> it's a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3892.668s">It's</a> a major concern to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3894.809s">You</a> hear very little talk about it, but it's happening every year and it's costing us, Mr. President, every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3901.531s">So</a> I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3904.34s">And</a> I think these are the conversations that probably aren't going to be brought to us, but we have to keep on speaking about them, saying what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3914.129s">And</a> I have to say over the years, the city has made some headway on INI. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3919.113s">They</a> reline pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3921.315s">There's</a> a system where you don't even have to dig up the pipe, you just reline it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3925.699s">And</a> it's a real cost effective <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3927.815s">efficient</a> way of relining our pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3930.416s">There's</a> another system, Mr. President, we have right now, we have catch basins, which are supposed to catch rain runoff water and send it out to the mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3940.158s">These</a> catch basins are hooked up to our sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3944.559s">So</a> that we know every time it rains, it's going right into our sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3949.44s">And</a> we have ways of indicating where these catch basins are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3952.661s">They</a> drop what they call a smoke bomb into the catch basin, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3956.263s">And</a> if it comes out the manhole cover, the sewer system, you know they're connected. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3960.645s">So</a> we're aware of at least, last I heard was probably 10 to 12 of these catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3966.068s">Every</a> time it rains, you can imagine the gallons of water that are pouring into our sewer system and going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3973.272s">Is</a> it expensive to take these catch basins and reline them and make them go where they're supposed to? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3979.416s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3980.416s">But</a> is it worthwhile in the long run? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3982.898s">Absolutely,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3984.198s">So</a> these are the issues I hope <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3985.963s">We</a> continue to discuss in our community on behalf of the ratepayer.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4022.734s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4024.714s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4025.574s">I</a> put this on the agenda because our budget process is coming up soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4030.635s">And</a> I wanna make sure that this council is aware of our role during the budget and aware of what we have as recourse <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4043.13s">when</a> the budget is presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4045.271s">And</a> last week, Mr. President, I was told by an administrative staff that this council has a line item cut authority, which over the years, I guess, depending on the administration, I've been told otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4061.441s">I</a> won't speak for my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4063.562s">And</a> I think we should set the record straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4066.364s">I</a> looked at chapter 44, section 32. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4069.305s">I</a> looked at some old opinions <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4072.14s">from</a> former city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4074.1s">I</a> looked at a letter from the Department of Revenue that was submitted back in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4078.301s">This</a> council over the years, not many occasions, has offered cuts to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4085.323s">I</a> remember back some years ago, and this was what I referenced last week, there was a motion to cut the then assistant director of DPW, because we're in tough budget times, and the motion passed, and the administration decided <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4102.193s">not</a> to make that line item cut, but cut somewhere else within the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4107.055s">There</a> was a motion a while back to take money and cut the water and sewer budget, Mr. President, by over $600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4116.958s">This</a> was back in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4120.079s">And</a> the council voted to cut 600,000 and use, if we remember, use the water and sewer surplus account, which you can only use it for two purposes, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4132.096s">One</a> is to use it for infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4135.539s">And</a> the other one is to offset water and sewer costs and rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4139.562s">So</a> the council said, you have 5 million in an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4142.324s">And</a> I can't remember the exact dollar amount at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4145.187s">Why</a> do we keep on raising the rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4146.948s">So</a> we thought within the budget that slashed this line item by 600,000, take it out of the enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4153.874s">The</a> mayor at the time, Mayor McGlynn, didn't like that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4157.857s">And</a> he vetoed our cut, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4160.99s">And</a> then we overrode the mayor's veto and that stood actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4166.234s">But</a> I think it's so crucial now that we understand what our role is, Mr. President, and what our abilities are to make cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4174.68s">And</a> I ask that we either contact the Department of Revenue, or we ask for an opinion from the city solicitor, what our responsibilities are on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4186.048s">Do</a> we just make bottom line cuts to departments? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4190.144s">Do</a> we just make bottom line cuts in general? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4193.586s">From</a> my reading of the Department of Revenue in chapter 44 of the general laws, it states if we do make bottom line cuts, we also have to indicate where the cut, what lines will be cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4206.194s">So</a> I think this would be very, you know, I've been on the council a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4210.436s">When</a> I received conflicting information, one administration saying you have zero authority over line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4217.299s">And</a> then another administration saying you have the ability to cut a line item in the last budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4223.061s">That's</a> conflicting to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4224.542s">And</a> at the very least, I think we need clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4227.083s">So</a> I would ask under your leadership, Mr. President, that we seek out that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4232.125s">And</a> I would put it in the form of a motion that we ask the city solicitor what role the council has in the either approving, rejecting or cutting <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4247.69s">line</a> items within the city budget.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5217.12s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5219.281s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5223.242s">He's</a> 100% right on all these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5225.563s">Council</a> Vice President Knight is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5228.197s">We</a> put a laundry list of conditions and the staging I think was your condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5232.72s">I</a> remember you speaking about having a staging area set up so they can put the equipment in trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5239.603s">I</a> think it's vital, Mr. President, that we find out who the clerk of the work is on behalf of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5246.947s">We</a> also should be asking this person if they're adhering to all the conditions, because let's be quite honest, I'm not looking and I'm not on that job site every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5256.239s">to</a> make sure that they're adhering to all these. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5258.602s">But</a> clearly, if you take a ride by, you're seeing the equipment left overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5263.588s">Clearly,</a> I forget who brought it up last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5265.75s">I</a> can't remember if it was Councilor Bears or Councilor Scarpelli about sweeping after every day's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5275.175s">And</a> we were notified and then the Councilor Falco, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5279.697s">And</a> these things aren't happening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5284.38s">When</a> we also discussed, we made a recommendation about having the three crews be put back. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5289.923s">When</a> you have the area residents on Winthrop Street reaching out saying, we've already had to put up with this for the last year and a half, two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5297.227s">And</a> if you want to extend the project, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5300.222s">by</a> not having enough crews, that just makes my life more miserable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5304.685s">So</a> we're already hearing this from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5306.806s">So</a> it's unacceptable for the chief, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5309.768s">And</a> if he was on the line, I'd say it right to his face. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5312.13s">It's</a> unacceptable that the chief unilaterally is going to make a decision to slow down a project that we've been working on for the past five years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5322.177s">And</a> that's impacting residents now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5324.158s">It's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5326.867s">unless</a> he can tell me it's a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5329.368s">If</a> you can't get enough offices on the detail, Mr. President, go outside the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5335.449s">They</a> do it every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5336.67s">Go</a> outside the community, find some offices, Mr. President, that want to fill the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5342.691s">But</a> to slow down a project of this magnitude and have residents put up with this, it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5348.033s">It's</a> extremely unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5350.367s">So</a> I agree with Council Vice President Knight, we should find out what that laundry list of conditions are from the Clerk of the Works, find out who the Clerk of the Works is, first of all, and have a discussion regarding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5362.13s">Regarding</a> the parking program, Mr. President, I believe the parameters within Park Method, their contract only states that they can operate on resident permit parking streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5375.594s">They</a> cannot operate outside of that contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5379.976s">So</a> if indeed they are going around giving out tickets on non-resident parking, permit parking streets, then we should be notified of that and find out when this change took place, why it took place, Mr. President, and maybe this was their decision and they want to increase their revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5397.68s">I</a> don't know, but that's not the way we should operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5400.32s">If</a> we have a signed contract, we should operate within the four walls of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5405.601s">And</a> that's my last impression of that contract, that it was only on resident, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5410.088s">permanent</a> parking streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5411.869s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6277.566s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6278.447s">I</a> wanna thank Council Vice President Knight for bringing this up and Councilor Scarpelli for his passion on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6286.533s">He's</a> been dealing with the youth of our community for many decades and I think has his finger on the pulse <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6293.362s">You</a> know, anytime you can expand the seat at the table where decisions are being made, I think is a positive step. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6300.564s">And</a> to have youth involved in decision making, I think is a very positive step in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6308.527s">I</a> remember the days back some years ago, Mr. President, the council, under the leadership of the president of the council, would allow members to invite <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6317.74s">a</a> business owner behind the reel, invite a student behind the reel, invite any one of your choice per week, Mr. President, and they would sit right next to you and they would have input, naturally they didn't have a vote, but they would have input during the meeting and be able to discuss and give input about how this may impact their business or impact their life or impact their family or whatever it might be, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6345.878s">And</a> I just thought it was a great way of all too often you hear people saying that they don't have a seat at the table or they're left out of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6354.501s">And</a> that was just a nice way of including members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6358.402s">And</a> I really would like to see us get back into that, Mr. President, and maybe under your leadership, we can once again reignite that and allow the council members to invite someone behind the real <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6372.906s">of</a> their choice, Mr. President, to partake in city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6376.927s">But</a> getting back to this, I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6380.128s">I</a> support anything that would bring additional people to the table and therefore get additional opinions on how city government should operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6389.872s">And</a> I support this wholeheartedly.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7118.658s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7120.379s">Just</a> one clarification, and I want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7124.86s">I</a> think we're making some real headway on housing issues within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7131.342s">I</a> believe, correct me if I'm wrong, the 50,000 that we asked to be in the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7136.952s">was</a> for housing assistance and not rental assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7143.316s">I</a> just want to clarify because I know there was some contention around why not just make a general statement regarding housing assistance and not rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7151.201s">So</a> I just want the record to reflect it's, I believe it's housing assistance.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7334.459s">Appreciate</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7336.26s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7338.902s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7339.823s">I</a> want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7343.866s">I</a> have to say we've been working on this ordinance for a period of time, but we're finally making some serious headway. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7351.592s">And</a> I think, Mr. President, it's not going to be just a knee jerk reaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7356.676s">It's</a> a very thoughtful process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7359.058s">And</a> I think, you know, the ordinance itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7363.008s">which</a> has some accountability within the ordinance, which I think will go a long way for pedestrian improving pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7371.859s">But</a> secondly, Mr. President, I think adding a component of city responsibility, you know, the ordinance originally was a focus on <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7381.303s">residents,</a> residents have to clear the corners, residents have to clear the sidewalks, they have to clear the front of the hybrids, residents have to do this, residents have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7390.25s">And</a> I think the subcommittee after digesting some of this said, you know what, in order to get a buy-in from the residents, we need the city to also step up and take responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7403.019s">And</a> I think what we found is by offering this priority sidewalk, where we're looking at 26 miles <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7411.09s">of</a> Ontario roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7413.495s">So</a> every road that's currently being swept right now <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7417.196s">in</a> our pilot program will now become part of, over a certain amount of inches, will now become part of an automatic plow that goes on the sidewalk and plow the sidewalk over a certain number of inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7432.103s">What</a> that does, as we've discussed, myself, Councilor Falco and Chairman Beers, is create the connectivity that we're talking about from business district to business district <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7442.187s">from</a> school to school, from elderly housing to elderly housing, from bus stop to bus stop, and it creates that automatic connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7450.693s">And</a> for the amount that we're looking at for upwards of $3,000 to $4,000 on an average snowstorm for a city this size, I think we all felt that this is our biggest bang for our buck to implement such a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7467.523s">How</a> it gets implemented, whether we outsource or see if we can <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7471.815s">handle</a> it in-house, still remains, and still a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7476.397s">But</a> I think we've made a lot of headway in improving pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7482.68s">And</a> I would welcome Steve South to any one of our open meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7486.822s">They've</a> all been open. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7488.122s">We've</a> had members of the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7490.123s">We've</a> had members of WOC Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7491.864s">We've</a> had members of WOC Boston attend our meetings and give input. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7496.366s">And</a> we're always welcome to hear input, Mr. President, on how we can better <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7501.795s">improve</a> this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7503.275s">You</a> know, the big issue that we've been struggling with is the crossings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7509.257s">So</a> right now, the ordinance states that the homeowner that lives at the corner would be responsible for clearing out the crossing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7518.939s">And</a> as we all know, many of the trucks plow to the corners, and in a big storm, you could have four, five, six feet of ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7526.78s">And</a> how do you have a homeowner that's gonna be responsible <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7530.81s">for</a> clearing that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7532.011s">So</a> part of the process for the priority sidewalk was to have 26 miles of these corners cleaned out automatically with these bombardiers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7542.497s">And</a> we're still trying to create a process that we can have snow counted off, or we can have a better policy on the city side where they don't plow directly to corners. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7553.745s">So</a> there's some administrative stuff we can work on, some ordinance stuff, and maybe some contractual stuff to help improve <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7561.4s">pedestrian</a> safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7563.281s">And</a> I just want to thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7565.082s">We've</a> put a lot of hours into this, and I hope eventually when we present it to the council for their input, that they'll see the amount of hours that we put into this and, you know, have their input as well, but see that really, I think this makes a lot of sense for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7582.589s">And</a> again, I want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco for their input on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7588.191s">And</a> the DPW commissioner as well, he's been <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7590.84s">instrumental</a> in this process, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7657.732s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7659.534s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7660.855s">Just</a> for the identification, you know, Councilor Bears gave a great explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7666.359s">I</a> just don't want anyone to think that we didn't share <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7669.587s">the</a> information as we go along. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7671.567s">So</a> at no time could someone say, geez, I didn't know they were working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7675.088s">We</a> laid it all out on the table, what we've been looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7678.068s">If</a> anyone wants to give input at this particular stage, they're welcome to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7682.089s">This</a> has been an open and notorious process, and we welcome input at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=7686.55s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_GswFX5Excbs/2024-11-19_GswFX5Excbs.html">City Council 04-27-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=218.829s">There's</a> something going on.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=667.571s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=669.792s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=671.232s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=672.893s">I</a> agree with both my colleagues, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=678.535s">I</a> think this warrants a far more in-depth detailed meeting, which would be precisely a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=684.818s">So</a> I agree with that assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=687.599s">The</a> question I did have, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=689.814s">And</a> it's great to have the full membership of the Traffic Advisory Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=697.936s">However,</a> that was the first step in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=701.997s">And</a> I think it would be equally as helpful to also have someone from the administration present, because the next phase of this, to my understanding, is rollout, implementation, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=714.599s">And</a> that's a vital component. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=718.523s">This</a> was fact gathering and making recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=721.205s">I</a> believe there were 21 really worthy recommendations made, but there's also two other steps in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=729.192s">And</a> I wanna make sure that this doesn't just end up in step one, that we see this to fruition, step two and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=736.038s">So</a> I would ask that the committee of whole also includes representatives from the city administration that can speak on this, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1889.06s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1890.841s">Over</a> the last several weeks, I received a number of phone calls and emails from area residents concerned about our waste collection. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1900.624s">And</a> the fact that for many residents of this community that have to deal with residents that putting their barrels out <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1912.103s">too</a> early, and it's creating not only debris, Mr. President, on these windy nights, as we all know, it's also creating an increase in rodents throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1926.275s">And</a> I'm getting complaint after complaint in many of our neighborhoods about an increase in rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1933.921s">And</a> we were told on many occasions, if you give them a water source and a food source, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1939.662s">rats</a> will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1941.123s">And</a> indeed, putting the barrels out too early is an additional food source. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1947.525s">So</a> I asked Mr. President not to be punitive and ask that the city find residents, but to notify residents that there is an ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1958.849s">And</a> the reason why I bring it up is <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1960.946s">You</a> never hear much discussion regarding the ordinance itself, but it does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1966.634s">And</a> I happen to have done a little research and asked our police department, code enforcement and border health, how many tickets <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1976.555s">were</a> issued over the past year for a violation of section 70-4, which is the placement of receptacles, which are trash bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1988.099s">And</a> I was told, Mr. President, that there were 55 tickets written in the past year, not all for putting out trash too early, for putting out <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2001.754s">So</a> for other items that are against the ordinance that are left overnight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2007.838s">So</a> it's clear to me that we've probably issued a dozen or two tickets for putting out trash too early in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2017.803s">And</a> I would just like to read the solid waste ordinance so people are aware, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2023.827s">I</a> don't think people are malicious. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2025.848s">I</a> know I'm always trying to get my trash out ahead of time to make sure it's out on the <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2030.08s">the</a> street, Mr. President, but I think once people are aware what the rules and regulations are, they will comply, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2038.765s">And</a> it's not just compliance for the sake of compliance, it's for the sake of not having trash blown all over the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2047.396s">not</a> having rodent problems and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2049.998s">So</a> section 70-4 of the solid waste article states, article one states, placement of receptacles. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2059.164s">All</a> receptacles containing ashes or rubbish, I think that shows you how old this ordinance is, shall be placed on the outer edge of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2070.492s">It</a> shall be placed in such a manner <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2072.675s">so</a> that the free flow of travel on the sidewalk is not obstructed nearby. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2078.917s">No</a> such receptacles containing ashes or rubbish shall be placed on the sidewalk earlier than 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2087.761s">of</a> the day immediately preceding the day appointed by the city for the collection of the receptacles. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2094.545s">So</a> if your trash is on a Tuesday, Mr. President, you can't put your barrel out before 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2101.83s">on</a> the Monday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2103.451s">So</a> if you put it out at three, four, five, six in the evening, you're in violation of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2110.416s">It</a> has to go out after seven, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2113.658s">And</a> I think once residents are aware of that, they will respect the ordinance, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2121.61s">And</a> I would ask that even if the reverse 911 call went out on this, just to notify residents, Mr. President, because it is becoming an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2133.68s">I</a> was going up on Riverside Ave the other day, and as we all know, it's been windy the last few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2140.425s">Literally</a> trash, it looked like a tape parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2144.108s">Trash</a> was blown everywhere, the tops were off the barrels, and really it was a mess and a hop. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2150.638s">Mr.</a> President, and that's not what we want to give the impression of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2155.964s">Also,</a> Mr. President, section 70-6, collection for businesses enforcement, all business establishments, rubbish shall be placed on the sidewalk for collection no earlier than 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2169.885s">on</a> the day appointed by the city for collection of rubbish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2174.409s">And</a> I know some businesses have put their trash out the night before because they may not get in to put the trash out the day of it after nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2185.78s">And</a> that is also a concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2188.842s">And</a> I would just ask if the Chamber of Commerce can let their membership know that, indeed, there is an ordinance that covers that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2197.328s">And</a> it also states, Mr. President, which someday may require an update from this council, it shall be the duty of the police officers to enforce the provisions of this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2208.375s">And</a> from what I'm being told by the building commissioner, Paul Mulkey, who I spoke to today, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2214.87s">It's</a> typically the Board of Health and court enforcement, our court enforcement officers that are issuing the tickets, not the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2224.218s">So</a> I would ask that subsection B of section 70-6 be updated by this council, probably the public works subcommittee to include language that would include enforceable by DPW, I'm sorry, by the building department <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2243.78s">and</a> by the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2246.802s">So</a> that's pretty much it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2249.684s">In</a> the interest of just getting the word out, I would ask that the city administration offer an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2257.35s">The</a> city administration do just an informational 911 alerting residents of the both business and homeowners of the trash ordinance and when trash receptacles <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2272.97s">are</a> allowed to be put out on the sidewalk for pickup, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2276.172s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2326.362s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2327.403s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President, I realize that we signed a long-term contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2333.549s">Actually,</a> the administration signed a long-term contract with waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2338.018s">But</a> in my opinion, over the years, this council has offered a number of resolutions requesting different solutions to some of the constituent calls that we're getting, Mr. President, to no avail. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2351.16s">And</a> it seems like either the city administration, and I'm not saying this administration, but past administrations are not willing to sit down because of a long-term contract and talk to waste management <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2365.235s">You</a> know, during COVID, it hasn't been much of an issue, but I can tell you firsthand that waste management picks up trash between seven and nine o'clock on the major thoroughfares when people are rushing to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2378.8s">And</a> I can tell you, it makes traffic go back 20 minutes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2383.922s">On</a> any high street, Riverside Ave, Salem, you mentioned on many of the major thoroughfares, that was one request they offered over the years, that they stay off the thoroughfares <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2393.722s">between</a> certain hours, and that would be seven or nine in the morning, and, you know, four to six in the evening, when we know there's a high impact of traffic to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2405.207s">And</a> for whatever reason, that always falls on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2407.968s">And</a> I think would alleviate some of the concerns when we talk about congestion in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2413.35s">So</a> I want to thank you for your recommendations as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2438.67s">You</a> know, looking at the whole section, it probably would require an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2443.293s">This</a> language is probably 60, 70 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2446.376s">So</a> I wouldn't say we look at the entire section.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2499.787s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2502.829s">We</a> just have to send it with our request because we can't just send a paper to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2508.462s">So</a> I think we have to also include what we're trying to accomplish.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2528.468s">Yeah,</a> we'll probably end up going to subcommittee anyways, but yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2531.929s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2557.153s">Yes,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2557.793s">Mr.</a> President, if we could also let the record reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2562.835s">Also,</a> there's a service that's provided by waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2566.656s">And</a> I've asked this a million times. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2568.513s">where</a> they will come around and clean the barrels, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2572.817s">And</a> it's a great service. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2574.979s">I've</a> asked a number of times that they provide, I think they subcontract, to go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2581.444s">We've</a> had these barrels for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2584.066s">Many</a> of them are big and cumbersome to work with, and it would be a great asset to have them come around and clean the barrels out, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2747.892s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2748.873s">I</a> want to congratulate my former colleague, Councilor Camuso, on this prestigious appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2760.04s">Mr.</a> President, little known fact that Paul Camuso used to skate for the Method High hockey team. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2767.545s">And</a> I'm supportive of this as long as he's not teaching our youth how to skate, because from what I recall, he wasn't a great skater, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2778.755s">And</a> as long as he's in the administrative end, I do support this, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3008.387s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3011.308s">I</a> want to thank you, Mr. President, because I know you've been on top of these particular roadways, and in particular the underpass on <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3022.034s">Riverside</a> Ave that had the lights out and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3024.856s">And</a> I know you've been a big advocate of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3027.657s">I</a> would ask Mr. President also that they take a look in general at all the state roads, Mr. President, within the city of Medford, in particular Wellington Circle and along the Fellsway because of <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3043.052s">The</a> number of businesses there, because of the number of cars that pass through that area, Mr. President, at any given time, if you take a walk through there, I think you'd be appalled on the amount of trash that is all over those. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3058.055s">And</a> really, DOT needs to step up and do it far more frequently than they do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3064.216s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3065.456s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3065.916s">So</a> I have that as an amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3068.277s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3069.425s">Councilor</a> Baca.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3390.492s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3391.753s">It</a> is with a heavy heart, Mr. President, that we just lost one of Method's finest, Bob McGovern, who we all knew affectionately in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3404.245s">You</a> never saw or rarely saw Bob without his lovely wife, Ian. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3410.291s">They</a> were always together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3412.212s">They</a> own the Superette <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3414.636s">which</a> had the best soft-serve ice cream on Spring Street for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3420.961s">It</a> was known as McGovern's Superette. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3423.864s">They</a> were truly a family-owned business, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3427.627s">If</a> you didn't have the money to pay for an item, they put you what was called the cuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3432.47s">They</a> put you on the cuff and they allowed residents, Mr. President, that may have been just squeaking by to gain access to <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3442.405s">a</a> lot of supplies within their Super Red. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3445.027s">And</a> they were truly, truly just a real good family in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3452.171s">Bob</a> loved spending time with family and friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3456.034s">If</a> you ever saw him, he was always the first to talk politics, but also asked you how your family was doing and how you were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3465.059s">And</a> he really cared. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3466.28s">He</a> didn't just ask and didn't wait for an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3469.242s">He</a> wanted to know how you were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3471.09s">and</a> if there's anything he can help you out with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3473.251s">And</a> that's the type of person Bob was. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3476.493s">He</a> grew up in the Wellington area, so I got to know him very well, Mr. President, and he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3485.098s">I</a> would ask, there were two people that passed recently, Mr. President, I would ask that this meeting be dedicated on behalf of Bob McGovern for his many years of service <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3499.454s">and</a> dedicated volunteerism in our community and for being the type of person that I think everyone wants to emulate as a family man, a businessman, and someone who really cared about the community and not about the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3516.978s">And</a> that is hard to find in this day and age, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3520.619s">And</a> on behalf of this council and his entire family, I want to wish them <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3530.425s">the</a> utmost sympathy during this very trying time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3534.086s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3610.03s">We</a> can do it together.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3638.159s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3638.459s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3638.619s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3638.739s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3638.879s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3639.019s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3639.239s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3639.38s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3639.48s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3639.68s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3639.78s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3639.86s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3639.98s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3640.08s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3640.26s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3640.36s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3640.48s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3640.64s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3640.86s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3641.061s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3641.241s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3641.381s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3641.581s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3641.781s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3641.881s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3642.061s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3642.141s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3643.422s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3643.982s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3647.346s">Bob</a> McGovern and Thomas Cangiano, a name synonymous with volunteerism in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3656.293s">He</a> served on a number of boards and commissions with distinction over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3662.157s">We</a> lost his lovely wife, Jane, back a few years ago, and they were inseparable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3669.102s">You</a> always saw them, they're like frick and frack together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3672.985s">And</a> Thomas was what, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3676.594s">I</a> would say is the model citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3680.455s">He</a> was a guy that I had a lot of respect for, someone that shot from the hip and told you how it was, Mr. President, and was doing it in a caring way, and someone that really cared about his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3695.978s">And</a> I know he was a loving husband, father, grandfather, uncle, and every time you saw him, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3705.251s">He</a> looked like an imposing guy when you saw him, but he had a heart of gold, let me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3710.834s">And</a> again, a person when you bumped into, the first thing he would ask you is, how are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3717.036s">And</a> in this day and age, you don't hear that too often. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3720.638s">Everyone's</a> self-absorbed and looking at their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3724.379s">And</a> he was always a person that would ask how your family's doing, how are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3731.202s">And</a> is there any way he can help you? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3734.004s">And</a> he truly meant it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3735.635s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President, for these two Method residents, that we also name this meeting, Mr. President, after Thomas Cangiano on his recent passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3749.182s">So</a> both Mr. Cangiano and Mr. McGovern, that this meeting be in their memories, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4576.464s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4579.584s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4582.025s">And</a> anytime my former colleague starts off with, I want to go back to 2002, I think we all know we're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4591.25s">But,</a> you know, I think what Councilor Penta mentioned, Mr. President, is valuable institutional knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4601.114s">And</a> when I say that, Mr. President, many of us behind the reel probably don't remember the days <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4607.938s">when,</a> as Councilor Penter alluded to, where we used to have five, six, seven, 800 abatements in the water and sewer department a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4618.06s">And</a> that wasn't because, you know, everything was running smoothly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4622.261s">It</a> was the fact, Mr. President, that we were estimating probably 50 to 60% of our water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4630.963s">And</a> that was creating so much confusion in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4635.484s">It</a> was really a crazy, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4637.543s">crazy</a> time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4638.784s">It</a> was probably one of the biggest issues of that day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4644.267s">And</a> when we moved to the new water meters, we really, in my opinion, solved a lot of the abatement issues, a lot of the issues of why is my bill so high, what's happening, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4658.478s">And</a> now, as Councilor Penta rightfully alluded to, we don't want to go back to those days, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4664.062s">Because</a> I remember those days, and they were awful, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4668.225s">The</a> number of phone calls and the number of research that was taken, the amount of research, I should say, that was taken on each and every resident's complaint was unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4681.335s">And</a> as Councilor Penta alluded to, I believe the life expectancy was around 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4687.757s">We</a> far surpassed the 10 years and eventually we're going to get into an issue and it's going to be all of our issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4695.161s">It's</a> not going to be, well, that's water and sewer or the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4698.623s">It's</a> going to be this council's issue that we go down that slippery slope again, when these meters one at a time across the city start to malfunction, we don't replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4709.989s">And</a> eventually we just start to estimate, which was the slippery slope we got into back in 2002. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4716.758s">as</a> Councilor Penta mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4718.86s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate, this is not a sexy issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4723.463s">It's</a> not something that people are gonna be banging your door down until it impacts them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4729.548s">And</a> why not head it off as Councilor Penta mentioned, we have over 5 million in the water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4737.814s">And</a> that money can only be spent to offset a deficit or infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4744.559s">Why</a> not look <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4746.052s">at</a> the replacement of either the batteries or a new water meter right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4752.774s">Why</a> not head off the potential of this heartache that you know is going to come down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4759.556s">Also,</a> Mr. President, as Councilor Penter alluded to, the city used to do a lot of I&I, inflow and infiltration, with the sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4769.259s">It</a> also was very aggressive with the leak detection program. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4773.55s">When</a> we discuss the meters, we have to look at INI and leak detection to see where we stand with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4780.254s">Because</a> those two alone cost the taxpayers millions of dollars a year in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4787.678s">And</a> it's strange, but if you know anything else in this community that was costing you as a rate payer millions of dollars, you would say, let's address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4797.344s">But</a> for some reason, water and sewer, it falls under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4801.406s">Because</a> the pipes are underground, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4803.452s">You</a> know, it's something that we don't look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4805.333s">Out</a> of sight, out of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4806.933s">But</a> it's an inherent problem in this community that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4811.655s">Also,</a> Mr. President, when we brought the system back some years ago, we were sold a bill of sales by the former engineers, Councilor Penter alluded to, Don Roulette, who I had a lot of respect at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4824.2s">It</a> was a big job, and as you know, every department was understaffed, and this was a big undertaking to change the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4831.415s">We</a> saw the bill of sales that the program was also going to have what they call an exception report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4840.157s">And</a> what that was, Mr. President, was a report that was run daily by the city, or at least they had access to running it, that would show spikes in water usage in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4853.019s">So</a> if you're a snowbird and you went to, you know, Florida in December, and you happen to have a leak in your house, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4861.208s">and</a> you weren't home and no one was there, you could see the spike because you'd be using water at two, three in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4868.232s">You'd</a> be using it on off days and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4871.094s">And</a> the city would be able to spit out a report saying this particular address had an exception, had a spike. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4878.515s">And</a> that's invaluable, Mr. President, to a resident and a homeowner that someone's watching over saying, hey, we're going to make sure that if there is a concern that we can address it and notify you as a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4892.814s">You</a> also may have an internal link. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4896.71s">So</a> you may have it a week that's not coming through a ceiling or a floor, but your bathroom toilet may be running constantly, and maybe you're not aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4907.033s">Or</a> maybe you have several toilets that are running constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4910.394s">Or</a> for instance, I got a call last week from a management company, and I won't mention the management company, and I won't mention the condo building in Method, but a management company reached out to me and said that they received, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4925.903s">a</a> $40,000 water bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4927.504s">I</a> got the same call. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4928.964s">You</a> got the same call, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4931.245s">And</a> they were not notified for two billing cycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4935.846s">So</a> it was 40,000 and 40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4939.588s">Their</a> typical bill may have been $4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4942.829s">And</a> once the management company found out and alerted the Condo Association, by that time, you know, and then they try to figure out, they hired plumbers and so forth, they found a leak <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4956.191s">was</a> internal, so it was after the meter on their property, but it was underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4963.195s">In</a> the end, the ground was absorbing the water, and no one was the wiser, Mr. President, other than the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4969.778s">But</a> if there was an exception report that showed, hey, typically, they're using just, say, 32,000 cubic gallons a month, and now they're using 450,000 cubic gallons a month, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4984.96s">That's</a> an exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4986.541s">And</a> the city should be notifying people saying, there's a huge exception, there's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4991.824s">Because</a> how do you turn to a homeowner, a condo association, which are homeowners, and say, you know what, your bill went from $4,000 to $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4999.828s">That</a> could have happened to any one of us behind this wheel, or anyone in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5006.775s">And</a> what do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5007.796s">What</a> a hardship that would be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5009.597s">When</a> the city reaches out and says, you owe us 40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5012.459s">How</a> do you dispute that? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5013.8s">The</a> leak was on your side. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5015.001s">It</a> wasn't the city's leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5016.262s">It</a> was your leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5018.264s">And</a> then the great fight is on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5020.705s">So</a> that is extremely important with the exception report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5024.048s">I'd</a> like to offer an amendment to Councilor Pinter's, if we could vote on it next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5031.173s">That's</a> fine, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5033.835s">But</a> I'd like to offer an amendment, Mr. President, we can bring up next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5037.192s">whether</a> or not the city is still actively involved with looking at exception reports, and if they have the capability, because this was some time back, if they still have the capability of running exception reports for unaccounted for water on behalf of residents and homeowners of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5060.26s">And</a> also, Mr. President, an amendment next week, because Council Vice President's right <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5066.53s">this</a> wasn't formally on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5069.451s">And</a> under our new rules, it has to be formally on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5072.453s">And</a> also Mr. President, that the 5 million surplus of water and sewer enterprise that the administration report back the status of the water meter systems in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5088.899s">And</a> when and if and when these meters are being looked at for replacement <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5096.527s">in</a> our community, where we stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5098.429s">I</a> think it's only appropriate we get an update on that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5111.083s">That</a> would be great.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5115.69s">That'd</a> be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5116.911s">Whenever</a> you could set it up, Mr. President, and the edification for the viewing audience and also this council, because water and sewer is a multi, multimillion dollar charge to this community through sewer and water. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5130.101s">I</a> think it's important that we all receive updates periodically to know where we stand.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1004.783s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1005.524s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1008.906s">The</a> Boyd family has been a long established family in this community, giving back much to the city over many, many decades between Bill Boyd Sr. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1018.513s">and</a> Bill Boyd Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1020.735s">They</a> are a tremendous family. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1023.117s">I</a> want to congratulate him on his seat to the New Hampshire State House. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1028.041s">I</a> believe they're only a part time <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1030.185s">legislative</a> body, but still, Mr. President, it's great to see someone with his integrity, put their hat in the ring and run for public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1041.051s">And</a> I just want to congratulate him. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1043.953s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1044.353s">Councilor</a> People.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1166.352s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1168.172s">I</a> had the opportunity to attend the third and final public hearing on April 14th of the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1178.555s">They</a> took, <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1180.41s">total</a> of 44 applications that were submitted by Verizon in over a three-day hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1187.874s">They</a> adjudicated all 44, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1192.796s">It</a> wasn't until the April 14th meeting, after listening to resident concerns in the Hillside, Method Square area, and in South Method, that we finally were able to <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1211.462s">get</a> a denial from the Small Ad Hoc Cell Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1217.624s">And</a> the denial was based on two particular Method residents who, in my opinion, did their homework and did their due diligence and presented the Small Ad Hoc Cell Committee with a number of issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1234.305s">and</a> the two sisters, in my opinion, I believe, set forth denial standards now that can be followed by other Method residents if and when Verizon or any other vendor approaches the city for more applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1257.416s">What</a> was presented that night, Mr. President, by <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1261.27s">the</a> two sisters and many of this document, much of the documentation has been presented to department heads here at City Hall, the city administration, members of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1273.158s">But</a> the, according to the denial reasons that were issued by the small ad hoc cell committee was the chairman, Chairman McGiven cited the interim policy 2-J, which is part of the mayor's interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1290.829s">and</a> 2-J states description as to why the desired location is superior to other similar locations from a community perspective, including visual aspects, proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks, or playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1308.407s">So</a> the chairman, in his denial statement, mentioned the interim policy 2-J. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1315.749s">They</a> also mentioned, Mr. President, which was brought up by the two sisters, Barbara Kendall and Marilyn Jordan, that they were concerned about the aesthetics of having this particular antenna within 20, 15, 20 feet of their windows in their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1335.473s">And</a> they were concerned from an aesthetic standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1338.191s">So</a> that was the first thing they raised, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1340.952s">The</a> other thing was the proximity to their home and proximity to an open front porch where they sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1348.296s">And</a> right now, there are no setback guidelines that the committee follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1354.659s">But</a> apparently, if residents raise concerns of the proximity to their home, <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1360.756s">and</a> the proximity to where they sit, whether it's an open front porch, whether it's stairs, you may sit in your stairs like I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1369.543s">You</a> may sit in a chair in front of your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1372.706s">So</a> those two, three items, aesthetics, proximity to home, proximity to open front porch were mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1381.934s">The</a> neighbors also suggested suitable other locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1387.047s">So</a> Barbara and her sister Marilyn said, what about this location? <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1391.408s">What</a> about this pole? <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1392.868s">What</a> about that pole? <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1394.188s">And</a> they listed a number of surrounding poles in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1398.269s">And</a> I think that falls in line with the policy 2-J, which mentions are there other similar superior locations? <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1409.951s">And</a> at the time, Verizon said that they couldn't locate any other locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1414.986s">However,</a> the board did not see fit and ruled for denial. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1420.949s">The</a> two sisters also presented a petition from area residents saying that area residents were also opposed that lived on Sheridan to installing a 5G antenna at that particular location. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1437.219s">So</a> based on these particular denial reasons, the five that I just mentioned, aesthetics, proximity to home, <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1444.368s">front</a> porch, suggestions of other suitable locations, and the presentation of a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1451.515s">It</a> doesn't have to be an act of Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1454.217s">We,</a> the undersigned, do not support 5G antenna on Expo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1459.182s">That's</a> all it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1460.685s">I</a> believe, Mr. President, this opens up the door for other residents down the line to offer the same other standards, the same other criteria, Mr. President, why they don't want it in front of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1476.73s">And</a> from my sitting on probably 10 to 12 hours of public hearing for that committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1485.087s">I</a> heard not only these two particular sisters, but a dozen other people mentioned very similar reasons over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1497.051s">And</a> the only one that got denied was this particular petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1501.352s">And</a> there was another petition, I believe there were two of them, based on clearance, ADA compliant clearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1508.574s">You</a> need 36 inches in width, <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1511.631s">And</a> we were told that all the polls were pre-examined by the city to make sure they were ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1520.837s">And</a> come to find out, maybe we missed a couple of polls, or maybe that review was still in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1527.541s">But</a> indeed, that wasn't the case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1530.932s">So</a> I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1533.274s">This</a> issue is not going away, and I think every resident, Mr. President, should be aware if this is something that they eventually receive a notice saying we're going to have a 5G in front of your house, this is the way, in my opinion, that you can combat that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1551.886s">I</a> offered the suggestion last week, Mr. President, and it was ironic to hear the chairman of the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1560.985s">state</a> that when these two sisters brought up a concern about their property value potentially being reduced because of having 5G in front of their home, the chairman immediately stated, well, he doesn't want to dispute that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1577.711s">However,</a> he believes it could be the opposite, that people in the community want the 5G, want the additional access, and that's precisely what this council voted <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1589.807s">unanimously</a> last week, saying, let's reach out to the general public, find out who's interested, and if they wish to have 5G, let's make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1603.417s">So</a> I'm glad to hear at least the chairman recognized there may be a better approach to this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1611.934s">then</a> we're currently undertaking right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1614.675s">So</a> I just want them to put that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1616.515s">There</a> were no formal motions tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1619.316s">This</a> was just for the edification of people in the community and possibly how, when, if and when they are presented with this means that they have to arm themselves and be informed on how to fight back, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1634.68s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1762.19s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1763.771s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1765.773s">I</a> just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1767.034s">This</a> may not be to Councilor Bears, but maybe to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nlEiBdF5xoQ&t=1772.679s">What</a> defines domestic partnership?<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_6Dwt4KXgHTk/2024-11-19_6Dwt4KXgHTk.html">City Council 04-13-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=121.308s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=121.848s">Mr.</a> President, if we could, Mr. President, I realized that we have been reading the governor's order since March of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=133.812s">And</a> I would ask that we send this to our city solicitor regarding language that states no in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=144.623s">That</a> is not, right now what we follow, Mr. President, as you know, we received from our local board of health, the approval of having in-person attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=157.187s">We</a> follow all the local board of health guidelines, as well as the CDC guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=162.528s">So</a> I would ask that this be sent to our city solicitor for a potential update, Mr. President, on that language.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=943.702s">Is</a> there any way the gentleman could maybe move up the sign and speak into the mic? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=947.424s">Because</a> I don't think people at home are going to be able to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=951.127s">at</a> that distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=952.308s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2933.21s">Councilor</a> Knox. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2936.592s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2937.573s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for their comments, and I want to thank BJ's <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2943.44s">for</a> being present tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2945.4s">What</a> I did hear at the outset, Mr. President, was that BJ's values their club and they value their members. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2954.282s">What</a> I did not hear was that BJ's values the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2959.983s">And</a> it may be because I live a couple of blocks over, Mr. President, that I could tell you firsthand the number of emails and phone calls I've received over the past <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2973.118s">many</a> years regarding BJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2976.639s">And</a> it's great to say that this is their first club, this is their flagship store, it receives extra maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2985.523s">Mr.</a> President, all you have to do is open your eyes and see that none of that is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2992.825s">All</a> you have to do is go along Woodruff Ave and see the many breaks in the fence, year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3001.351s">and</a> the debris from their parking lot blows out into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3006.135s">It</a> was just about three days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3008.197s">So</a> if anyone went by there and looked at Woodruff Ave and said, what a nice clean area it is, it was my call to DPW, which happens two or three times a year, Mr. President, to Steve Penaglia, the head of our highway, that got that area once again cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3027.168s">And</a> it was our DPW that went out there that would cut down the debris and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3032.673s">Yes,</a> BJ's has done some improvements after many, many, many calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3040.28s">And</a> I've personally made them to the store managers over and over again, the district managers and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3046.266s">And</a> they will eventually make some improvements, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3050.782s">But</a> it's clear to me, if you look at the lot, you look at the debris, you look at the fact that it is not a pedestrian-friendly business. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3061.387s">Anyone</a> right now that has to walk to BJ's, so if you're an area resident or neighbor and you wanna walk there, you're taking your life in your hands going through their lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3071.851s">That's</a> how dangerous it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3074.812s">And</a> that's why the Community Development Board made the recommendations they did, Mr. President, regarding circulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3080.959s">It</a> wasn't just for vehicular traffic, it was for pedestrians as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3085.862s">That's</a> how dangerous it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3090.565s">I</a> remember getting the calls over and over again, Mr. President, because the sweeping that they do in their parking lot, two, three in the morning, the sweeper would be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3103.613s">You</a> can imagine the noise and the echoing of the noise in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3108.151s">And</a> I can't tell you how many times, how many calls I had to put out, Mr. President, in order to get BJs to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3116.053s">And</a> then they stated they did something, and within three weeks, it's back again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3122.175s">The</a> noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3124.256s">Idling</a> trucks overnight, Mr. President, with the refrigerators, parked in the lot for hours and hours and hours, idling trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3135.168s">It</a> wasn't until we brought BJ over and over again and asked them, what can they do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3140.63s">I</a> believe they started locking their lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3143.112s">I</a> don't know if they put a chain in the front back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3145.373s">They</a> started locking their lot, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3147.974s">But</a> still, at night, that lot remains open on many occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3154.642s">Drag</a> racing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3155.823s">You</a> might say, how can you drag race on the back of the lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3159.185s">They</a> start from the beginning of the lot on the Fellsway, Mr. President, where that little stretch of road runs along Woodruff into the parking lot, and they drag race inside there at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3173.493s">These</a> aren't made up stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3174.994s">These</a> are what the neighbors have to put up with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3180.277s">You</a> know, BJ's has not been a good neighbor, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3183.769s">I've</a> lived in the area 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3187.251s">They</a> have not been a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3190.193s">And</a> I don't believe they value the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3193.155s">If</a> this is their flagship store, shame on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3196.117s">I'd</a> hate to see what the other stores look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3202.441s">You</a> know, they mentioned about substantial improvement to the circulation, to the landscaping, to the lighting on their lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3210.646s">They</a> haven't mentioned the concerns <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3213.109s">of</a> the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3216.03s">We</a> heard that this new station is a great distance away from the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3226.294s">I</a> challenge anyone to take a walk down there tonight, and we'll see what this great distance is from the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3233.177s">We'll</a> see, Mr. President, the 64,000 gallons of flammable gas that's going to be in very close proximity to homes in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3241.684s">and</a> ask if you would like to live that close in that area, or anyone from BJs, if they'd like to live that close. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3248.308s">This</a> is a secondary use for BJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3252.931s">And</a> it's great that they wanna take care of their members, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3256.994s">What</a> else does the membership want? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3259.215s">Where</a> else can we put that lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3260.496s">It's</a> a big lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3265.059s">How</a> else can we accommodate the membership of BJs and disregard the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3272.671s">And</a> that's exactly what we're doing here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3275.653s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, BJ's approached the city council some many years ago for a license for gas storage on that property, and they were denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3288.103s">For</a> many of the same reasons you're hearing here tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3294.589s">You</a> know, we heard about trucking, one truck a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3298.512s">That's</a> for the gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3299.272s">That</a> doesn't include their other operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3301.852s">how</a> many other trucks are coming in, 18 wheelers, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3305.933s">Operational</a> noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3308.914s">They're</a> not putting this gas station for no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3312.175s">As</a> the gentleman stated, I believe it's near Woburn BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3316.176s">People</a> would like to have one closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3319.157s">So</a> we'll divert a lot of that traffic to Woburn, into Middlesex Ave, into the Fellsway, into our neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3333.891s">additional</a> path trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3335.592s">It</a> was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3336.793s">I</a> happened to have attended the Conservation Commission hearing on January 15th, and I spoke and represented what I believe the neighborhood concerns, and they did a good job as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3349.284s">I</a> also spoke at the September 16th Community Development Board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3355.529s">And</a> let's not forget, Mr. President, we can thank the Community Development Board, the Conservation Commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3362.725s">But</a> guess who represents the neighbors in the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3366.347s">It's</a> this Method City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3370.51s">And</a> we're the ones, Mr. President, that feel the complaints, that hear the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3383.618s">So,</a> Mr. President, what I would ask is for BJ's tonight to present to us <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3393.649s">what</a> the lighting impacts associated for this proposal on the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3400.456s">What</a> are the direct lighting impacts on the residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3404.219s">I'd</a> like to hear from them tonight, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3475.368s">I</a> appreciate your comment.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3621.625s">So</a> you're going to add an internally illuminated sign?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3627.93s">But</a> you're going to add an additional sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3630.331s">No,</a> sir.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3637.973s">So</a> you're going to have the one BJ sign, and then you're going to replace it with a BJ and gas sign in one sign?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3661.401s">And</a> what about, you're going to have a canopy around the station?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3669.185s">And</a> is any illumination associated with that canopy?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3679.371s">What</a> about on the exterior of the canopy? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3682.312s">Anything</a> that's lit up on the exterior?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3711.437s">So</a> what about, okay, that's, well, that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3714.602s">additional</a> sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3716.303s">It's</a> additional lighting that wasn't mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3719.884s">I</a> just want to lay everything on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3721.504s">I</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3721.924s">So</a> there's no surprises. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3723.185s">And</a> I want to be what about gas prices? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3725.045s">Are</a> you not going to say what your prices are?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3758.155s">Right,</a> so that's not what we just heard from this gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3762.197s">He</a> said they were replacing the existing sign within the frame of that sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3766.119s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3767.039s">And</a> I'm sure you can't fit your pricing in there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3770.581s">Yes,</a> we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3771.601s">So</a> you're gonna take that existing sign, you're gonna have the BJ's logo, you're gonna have the new station saying gas or whatever it is, and then you're gonna have your illuminated prices for your regular unleaded, high test unleaded, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3786.729s">That's</a> all gonna fit in the same sign.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3792.812s">And</a> you're not gonna expand the square footage?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3809.426s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3811.647s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3812.307s">In</a> regards to the emissions of odor from the gas, how are you addressing that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3854.015s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3856.256s">So</a> what happens when someone overfills <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3859.269s">it</a> leaks onto the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3860.309s">Are</a> there any vapors that are emitted from that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3871.292s">I'll</a> be honest with you, it happens with me all the time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3874.113s">All</a> the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3874.673s">I</a> try not to, but it happens.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3900.313s">Is</a> this self-serve or full-serve or both? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3903.636s">Self-serve.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3904.616s">Self-serve.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3905.077s">So</a> you will not have any type of attendant on that property?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3943.388s">And</a> is this only available to BJ's members or can anyone from the public use that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3959.993s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3961.253s">So</a> why does a company like Stop and Shop provide a discount for their Stop and Shop customers, but also allow you to purchase gas there as well with no discount? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3972.625s">just</a> so you don't stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3975.146s">And</a> yours is just an exclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3977.188s">So</a> it's only for BJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3978.748s">So</a> if I'm driving there and I'm running out of gas, I can't use your gas.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3986.233s">And</a> how does that benefit the neighborhood and the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3996.598s">And</a> those of us that are not members, we're not welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4000.26s">We</a> want to make you a member, sir.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4011.003s">I</a> see the value if I'm a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4012.583s">I</a> don't see a value if I'm not a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4014.845s">And</a> that's, I think, something that your corporate office should really look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4020.948s">So</a> regarding the- Okay, Mr., I'm sorry.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4073.066s">No,</a> that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4075.608s">During</a> the testimony at one of the public hearings, an outside expert came in regarding the report for traffic engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4088.737s">And</a> they mentioned in their report <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4091.428s">that</a> they predicted the traffic impacts have been underestimated by your traffic expert.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4110.48s">Well,</a> I'd like to hear, you know, I realized there's two experts and one saying one thing, one saying another thing.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4421.346s">I</a> appreciate your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4422.787s">Mr.</a> President, if I could just end my comments and I appreciate the council indulging me and I appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4430.9s">BJ's</a> not taking exception to what I had to say, Mr. President, but much of this has been pent up over a number of years with the lack of attention by BJ's to this particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4445.291s">And,</a> you know, it's great that they're at the table and they're willing to make some improvements, but they're also looking for approval from this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4453.958s">And</a> it makes me wonder if <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4455.578s">BJ's</a> would be at the table if that was not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4459.76s">The</a> council's review of BJ's application for a gas storage and sale license may consider fire and safety hazards associated with the 64,000 gallons of fuel storage next to a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4474.846s">The</a> council can also consider noise associated with the construction, increased trucking and car trips, and along with operational noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4484.073s">which</a> we know will happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4486.435s">I</a> just want to lay out my concerns regarding gasoline emissions, additional trucking, additional noise, additional car trips, fire and safety hazards associated with that amount of gasoline storage next to a neighborhood and the traffic impact on area residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4505.988s">And</a> I appreciate everyone indulging me while I made my comments.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6060.56s">I</a> think, uh, I'm not sure if the petitioner is allowed to waive that requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6064.483s">I</a> think that's a statutory requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6066.805s">Um,</a> and at this particular time, Mr. President, this issue has been out before the community for close to two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6074.132s">There's</a> been ample input <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6076.567s">by</a> both residents, by this council, by BJ's, and at this junction, based on what was brought up by this council regarding additional trucking, additional traffic impacts, additional car trips, noise, regarding gasoline emissions, fire and health concerns, regarding the amount of storage, regarding that BJ's has not been a good neighbor, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6107.01s">In</a> the area, Mr. President, I would move for denial, Mr. President, of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6115.813s">Yes,</a> sir.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6155.685s">Yeah,</a> I have a motion on the table, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6255.005s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6258.366s">I'm</a> not quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6259.346s">I</a> know Council Vice President Knight mentioned that fact that they may not have to go back before the Community Development Board or the Conservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6267.11s">I'm</a> not quite sure without having our legal counsel give us guidance on that, that that is indeed correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6275.713s">And</a> I would state at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6278.055s">that</a> we move forward on the motion that I made Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6290.026s">I</a> still ask that we take our vote Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6293.229s">This</a> is a Medford City Council meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6297.133s">What's</a> that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6339.178s">This</a> is to deny, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6341.559s">This</a> is a two-year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6344.28s">It's</a> been a two-year process.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8589.944s">Vice</a> President Rice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8591.725s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8665.648s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8666.489s">I'll</a> be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8667.129s">My</a> colleagues, I think, did a great job on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8670.489s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's only appropriate that we receive a correspondence from the chief of police regarding his reasoning for only allowing the one crew to start off on April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8683.812s">And</a> what are his expectations <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8686.837s">to</a> have more crews added and what that timeframe is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8690.999s">I</a> think residents should be aware of what's going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8695.021s">And</a> I won't reiterate what my colleagues stated, but this project, as Councilor Falco mentioned, has been going on since 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8702.764s">And</a> really, I think this has to come to some type of resolve.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8708.747s">Yes,</a> please.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9751.83s">In</a> my opinion, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9770.98s">this</a> process has been lackluster at the very best. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9776.805s">There's</a> been insufficient community outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9780.027s">And</a> I think if you attended any of the two hearings that have taken place so far, you will hear that from residents, even the emails we receive and the phone calls that many residents feel left out of the process, feel that they haven't had any decision making within this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9800.123s">and</a> feel that their concerns don't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9803.545s">And</a> that's their own feeling and their own opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9806.887s">And</a> residents are entitled to that, Mr. President, because indeed, I have the same feeling, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9814.192s">And</a> I attended both meetings that were held, both public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9818.695s">And</a> to say that the public hearing is a place to allow for public comment, I believe falls short of the mark <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9829.123s">when</a> residents are given two minutes to speak and really can't get their message out within that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9837.75s">If</a> we recall back a little over a year ago, I believe it was, there was a meeting up here with well over 100 residents that got canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9846.737s">Then</a> there was a follow-up meeting, as Council Vice President Knight refers to, that was held by the city in Verizon, and it was like a science fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9856.243s">that</a> you come in and you just walk around to different exhibits that were laid out here in the chamber, and you never really got to sit down and hear what other residents have to say, never got really to participate in a back and forth dialogue, and I believe that was part of the insufficiency regarding community outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9876.921s">The</a> city, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9879.116s">And</a> it's no reflection on the board members. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9880.956s">I</a> hope they don't take it personal on the small 5G, but the city was ill prepared for this much anticipated 5G hearing that took place, the two that took place over the last two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9894.759s">The</a> city did not present one subject matter expert, but relied heavily on Verizon and their subject matter experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9906.101s">And</a> I think that lends itself right there, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9909.246s">to</a> people in the community feeling that there's no one there looking out for their interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9914.389s">And</a> I think they have every right to believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9917.19s">We've</a> had ample time to bring a subject matter expert on board that can give us some guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9925.474s">People</a> I've spoken with aren't necessarily against 5G, they're concerned with the proximity of 5G to their home, to their bedroom, to their front porch, to where their kids play. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9936.94s">That's</a> their concern and they have every right <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9939.434s">to</a> be concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9941.538s">I</a> think right now where the next public hearing is coming up to finish off the remaining 20 <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9949.702s">applications.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9950.463s">I</a> believe there are 44 altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9952.285s">I</a> believe there's roughly 20 left or right around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9955.488s">The</a> next hearing is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9957.41s">And</a> we should be discussing next steps now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9960.533s">Because</a> from what we heard, Mr. President, this was the first of many applications that are going to be submitted, not only by Verizon, but other vendors as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9972.465s">And</a> I think we learned from this first process a number of things, of which that the small ad hoc small cell committee, we need to prepare for the next round of anticipated applications and putting safeguards out there that <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9994.42s">will</a> indeed address resident concerns and next step suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=9999.622s">So</a> tonight, Mr. President, and I know the clerk is looking at me with an evil eye, because we've often, this council has approved so many amendments and suggestions, but Mr. Clerk, just bear with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10012.528s">The</a> next steps, Mr. President, we have to look at discussing improving the public outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10019.071s">If</a> we continue to have a process where people feel left out, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10024.406s">It's</a> going to make this process very difficult, not just for 5G, in general going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10030.972s">We</a> need to devise a better way of reaching out to the community, getting feedback, implementing that feedback, and doing additional public outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10040.842s">Just</a> notifying people of a public hearing, in my opinion, is not enough public outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10046.987s">We</a> need to discuss immediately <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10049.193s">to</a> bring a consultant on board that has 5G expertise to protect our city's interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10056.359s">It's</a> not too late, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10058.721s">That</a> has to happen immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10060.783s">We</a> need to discuss amending the existing interim policy or creating a new ordinance to add community input and additional health and safety guides. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10071.691s">This</a> council over the last year and a half has offered probably close to 18 to 20 amendments <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10079.176s">asking</a> the city administration to look at the interim policy and make some changes based on what we believe could provide some protection for our community and answer some questions in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10092.712s">That</a> is yet to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10095.095s">I'm</a> not opposed to creating an ordinance at the time, if we recall, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10099.278s">The</a> interim policy was created because Verizon approached the city back in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10106.51s">They</a> sat down with the city administration back in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10112.011s">They</a> sat with the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10114.252s">They</a> sat with the board of health. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10115.933s">They</a> sat with the city solicitor at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10119.254s">They</a> sat with the mayor at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10121.515s">And</a> Verizon said, we're coming into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10123.916s">The</a> city was under the gun to create some type of policy, some type of mechanism to hold Verizon accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10131.699s">They</a> put forward an interim policy within a matter of 24 to 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10136.701s">They</a> sent it to the council after creating this interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10141.403s">And</a> we use that as a guide, Mr. President, knowing these applications were being submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10147.065s">There's</a> nothing that prevents us as a community to creating an ordinance now, enhancing the existing interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10156.047s">In</a> my opinion, an interim policy has the same teeth as an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10161.141s">So</a> if we already have the current document, let's work with the current document. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10165.183s">But</a> I'm open to any suggestions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10168.525s">We</a> also need to start immediately to discuss expanding the ad hoc small cell committee to include resident participation on the small cell committee and an expert in 5G on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10185.315s">Why</a> would you create a committee with an even number of members? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10189.554s">What</a> happens with a two-to-two vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10192.696s">Can</a> anyone tell me? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10195.018s">What</a> happens with a two-to-two vote?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10199.221s">It</a> makes no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10202.103s">And</a> some of these things can be done at the wave of a pen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10206.686s">That's</a> all it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10208.187s">Remember,</a> an interim policy is far less rigid than an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10213.791s">It's</a> far less rigid, and it could be far more fluid <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10217.478s">and</a> changes and thinking and quick reactions, Mr. President, to safeguard this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10224.122s">We</a> need to discuss mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10226.463s">This</a> council has voted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10227.704s">I'll</a> bring it up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10229.585s">We</a> need to discuss mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10232.247s">This</a> council has requested 7-0 to ask the small ad hoc committee to stop moving forward on applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10244.966s">Last</a> week, last Thursday, when they brought it up, I specifically mentioned that one recommendation, even though we voted on a number of recommendations, and we were told by the lawyer from KP Law, not our own lawyer, that not quite sure that has any bearing that the council wants the small cell committee to stop at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10266.677s">That's</a> what we were told, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10282.249s">Well</a> put. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10283.249s">That's</a> exactly what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10284.83s">That's</a> exactly what's happening right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10288.553s">So</a> that is a major issue, Mr. President, that recommendations by the community and by the council are being ignored, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10296.938s">When</a> you have a unanimous vote by the council, it should carry some merit in some way, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10302.841s">And</a> there's no rush to judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10304.862s">No</a> matter what 90-day shock rock we keep hearing, that Verizon is saying, Method, you're on a 90-day shock rock. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10312.747s">We're</a> in the middle of a pandemic, Mr. President, for the last 14 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10317.315s">in</a> the middle of a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10318.995s">And</a> yes, indeed, Verizon submitted their applications a while back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10322.616s">But</a> this community has every right to test out what's going to happen in this community, and every right to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10329.817s">Even</a> though FCC regulations may say you can't discuss certain things like health, and you can't put a moratorium, which are FCC regulations, we have every right as the protectors of our residents and our community to stand up and say, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10346.707s">we</a> want to take a closer look. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10348.709s">And</a> we're not going to go by any 90-day shot clock, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10353.713s">We</a> also need to discuss a community meeting with our state and federal delegation to address the 5G rollout and the concerns we have with the FCC regulations and this declaratory regulation that ties the hands of local municipalities, that does not allow local municipalities to make their own decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10376.38s">The</a> last thing we need are people up in Congress and people up in the White House, Mr. President, to be making local decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10384.423s">Who</a> knows best about local government? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10387.844s">Not</a> the people sitting in Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10389.685s">I</a> can assure you that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10393.547s">I</a> would also ask, Mr. President, and this is a process of proven suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10400.69s">I</a> was thinking about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10402.85s">Right</a> now when Verizon comes in, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10405.029s">They</a> fill out an application. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10407.09s">They</a> submit their location criteria, where they think the best poll is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10411.653s">They</a> submit their insurance binder, they're saying they have enough insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10416.675s">They</a> submit a lot of different paperwork, and they submit it to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10421.138s">This</a> is where we'd like to be, in front of 102 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10427.121s">And</a> that person that lives at 102 Main Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10430.319s">then</a> gets notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10432.0s">Here</a> you are, Verizon wants to be in front of your home, go to a public hearing if you have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10438.282s">Why</a> not, Mr. President, why not have an application of interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10444.584s">Why</a> not require through the interim policy that if Verizon or any other entity want to come in the community, the first thing they do is submit an application of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10455.703s">We</a> are interested in coming into the community, and we are interested in going in front of this location, or that location, just of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10464.729s">That</a> would trigger off the city, then, Mr. President, to do guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10469.992s">Public</a> outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10473.814s">Why</a> not address, Mr. President, if there are people in the community that support 5G, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10480.467s">People</a> in the community don't believe that there may be associated health risks of being that close to the poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10486.449s">Why</a> don't we reach out to the community and ask those that wouldn't mind having 5G in a poll in front of their home? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10495.833s">Sounds</a> like a novel idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10499.074s">That</a> way you're not just placing polls, Mr. President, you're asking for public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10505.487s">And</a> if you happen to get 20, 40, 50, 60, 100, 200 people that said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10512.629s">I</a> don't mind it in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10515.009s">Why</a> not be armed with that information and then go to Verizon and say, now when you come in, you have your application. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10523.511s">These</a> are the locations, when you do your grid and your networking, these are the locations we prefer you select. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10533.032s">Therefore,</a> we head off all the public resentment, Mr. President, all the concerns that may be out there, which are rightfully so, about being in close proximity to 5G, and we head a lot of that off. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10545.799s">This</a> is a suggestion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10548.58s">And</a> I think it's a worthy suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10550.761s">And</a> if we were sitting around a table discussing this and not just having Verizon force feed us what the next steps are, which is currently happening now, we're being force fed this by Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10563.786s">Rather</a> than us leading this, we should be leading the discussion, not Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10570.229s">And</a> it's the reverse right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10572.35s">So</a> I make a motion, Mr. President, that the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10575.959s">amend</a> the interim 5G policy to include similar language that I just proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10581.881s">And</a> I'd be willing to sit down with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10584.482s">I'd</a> be willing to sit down with the small cell ad hoc committee to work out some language in their interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10592.145s">I</a> think it's a worthy suggestion to look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10596.687s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I think it was quite telling over the last two meetings of the public hearings that <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10604.716s">And</a> out of the four board members, there was one board member that voted some petitions up and voted some petitions down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10614.758s">And</a> the board members have every right to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10617.778s">That</a> board member was the head of the Board of Health, which to me carries an awful lot of weight when we're discussing public health in this community, an awful lot of weight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10629.7s">So</a> I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10633.45s">that</a> we put in the form of a motion, I'd like to know that the Board of Health Director state whether or not 5G is a public health risk to the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10651.001s">I'm</a> asking the Board of Health Director whether or not 5G, she considers 5G a public health risk to the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10660.927s">I</a> think we all have the right to know <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10663.018s">when</a> someone takes a vote, Mr. President, especially a vote that goes one way, then another way, then another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10668.801s">What</a> is the reasoning for that vote, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10671.763s">And</a> if there's a public health concern in this city, I'd like to hear it directly from the horse's mouth, which is the head of the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10680.448s">Also</a> during the meeting, Mr. President, Verizon asked for a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10686.492s">And</a> the reason why they asked for a waiver, Mr. President, was the fact that our policy states that <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10692.54s">These</a> small cell antennas have to be located within a shroud or a canister. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10699.562s">Says</a> it right in our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10701.982s">It's</a> black and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10704.183s">There's</a> no ands, ifs, or buts about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10706.743s">Verizon</a> stated at the public hearing they had their expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10711.024s">Unfortunately,</a> we didn't have an expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10713.525s">They</a> stated that their 5G cell doesn't work if it's located within a canister. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10720.167s">I'm</a> being told other communities <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10723.052s">have</a> asked that, and they are receiving that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10728.694s">But</a> I'm being told that our board is going to give Verizon a waiver to waive that section of the interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10738.157s">So</a> on one hand, these members can waive policy, but they can't consider amendments offered by an elected board, seven members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10749.64s">So</a> I find that a little ironic, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10754.094s">Another</a> point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10758.155s">It</a> was mentioned during one of the meetings by the city engineer, and he could speak for himself, he's a very capable person. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10766.217s">He</a> asked, which I thought was an excellent question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10769.038s">He</a> said, in my background as an engineer, we do post-testing, I mean pre-testing and post-testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10777.24s">So</a> for instance, 5G has this cell device that they wanna locate on our poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10784.388s">5G</a> Verizon does rigorous testing in a control environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10790.532s">Then</a> they take the 5G antenna out of that control environment and they locate it on a pole 10 feet from your bedroom window. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10800.577s">Now</a> something goes awry with that 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10805.16s">Supposedly</a> Verizon has a mechanism that sends an alarm to Verizon saying we have a concern <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10812.591s">This</a> pole, there's something wrong with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10814.931s">They</a> may be emitting too much microwaves in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10819.412s">It's</a> not functioning the way it should. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10822.133s">And</a> supposedly, that mechanism will send a truck out, and they'll do the testing they have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10827.534s">The</a> city engineer mentioned a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10833.635s">He</a> said, what about having twice a year, three times a year, quarterly a year to have post-testing? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10842.509s">So</a> Verizon will come out to our 50, 60, 80, 100 locations, which won't take them long, they're a huge company, and test them by hand and make sure they're functioning properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10855.398s">You're</a> not relying on a little bell to go off, or you're not relying on some safeguard that who knows, may work in the winter, may not work in the summer, who knows under what conditions, because it hasn't been tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10870.08s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10871.0s">It</a> was tested in an environment, a control setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10874.362s">And</a> we all know it's not a control setting in the winter, in the summer of New England weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10880.385s">So</a> I thought that was a great suggestion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10883.467s">And</a> Verizon pooh-poohed the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10888.169s">But</a> other communities, Burlington, I looked at their policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10891.771s">Cambridge,</a> they have it built in for periodic reviews of their 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10899.329s">They</a> have it built in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10902.131s">But</a> for some reason, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10905.073s">It</a> looks like we just bend over for Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10909.856s">Next,</a> Mr. President, Chapter 74, Section 225 of the Municipal Ordinances of Medford states, not making this up, Section B, extensions <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10928.84s">shall</a> not be made on any pole without the approval of the superintendent of wires. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10937.764s">So</a> if they have an extension with this device, to me is an extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10942.846s">Some</a> of the poles in the city now are higher than other poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10946.547s">These</a> are extensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10950.429s">That</a> ordinance, Mr. President, has not been followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10957.85s">We</a> need to know how many extensions has Verizon put on these locations and other locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10966.072s">As</a> we heard, I think it was from Councilor Penta last week or the week before, stating that they've been around the city for well over a year now preparing for this and working on polls that they're not even requesting applications for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10982.796s">So</a> there are extensions going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10986.621s">And</a> I don't think we should be giving a waiver to a city ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10996.229s">The</a> last thing, Mr. President, is I believe in many of the conditions that the small ad hoc committee put on, I think we're rightfully so to help benefit this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11011.342s">But</a> when you have 12, I think it was 12 last count I had, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11016.216s">12</a> conditions on an application, I think it speaks volumes to what is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11024.024s">Why</a> do we need 12 conditions? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11027.847s">Maybe</a> the interim policy is not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11031.731s">Maybe</a> the interim policy needs to be tweaked. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11034.574s">Maybe</a> the interim policy, Mr. President, needs additional follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11041.052s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that we receive an immediate opinion from the city solicitor, and I'm putting this in the form of a motion, regarding Chapter 74, Section 225, regarding Verizon's poll extensions and whether or not these approvals and this process, Mr. President, should be valid and should continue forward when I believe it's in violation of city municipal ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11071.755s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for listening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11075.376s">I</a> want to thank them for their support over the last several weeks, many of which have made their opinions known. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11082.518s">And</a> most of all, Mr. President, I want to thank the community for uniting around this issue and making sure whatever is done, Mr. President, we know what the long-term <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11094.193s">impacts</a> may be to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11096.734s">And</a> right now, we don't know what the long-term impacts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11100.375s">And</a> let's not rush to judgment on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11103.076s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11104.277s">Council</a> Member Rowe.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11317.304s">If</a> it wasn't part of it, I'd welcome that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11435.651s">That's</a> correct, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11443.713s">Correct,</a> correct, yeah, emergency meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11451.28s">No,</a> I have no problem voting them as one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11453.821s">I</a> would just ask that if we can add the public comments regarding the discussions that we should be having, I laid out, I think it was seven different comments regarding what the next step should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11469.027s">And</a> I don't know if that requires a formal vote, but if we can add that into the minutes of the record, and I can go over them with the city clerk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12636.679s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12640.161s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12641.421s">And</a> I won't reiterate what my colleague stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12643.902s">But</a> the one thing I remember about Joe was that you always knew where you stood with Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12650.904s">And,</a> you know, he would come out and tell you, you know, if you were talking to him and he disagreed, he let you know he disagreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12658.851s">He</a> never sugarcoated anything, and I respected him for that, and I think that's what made Joe who he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12665.674s">As</a> was mentioned by my colleagues, he was a true family man and really cared about the people that he was in contact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12672.818s">And</a> on behalf of this council, I just want to send my condolences to his family and his wife.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_0CWldZ_RYd4/2024-11-19_0CWldZ_RYd4.html">City Council 04-06-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=23.449s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=994.085s">So</a> Chief, that's one of my main concerns is that the headquarters, as we all know, was pushed off <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1000.592s">when</a> we were gonna do a combined police and fire center. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1003.554s">And</a> we only ended up moving forward with the police side. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1006.976s">And</a> at the time, the headquarters had a lot of immediate needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1011.078s">And</a> now what troubles me is that the mayor's capital plan calls for looking at the headquarters in year, I believe it's four or the five year capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1020.523s">And</a> we all know that who knows what's gonna happen in year 2024, if that will still be the priority of the city, would be other needs that jump ahead of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1030.799s">which</a> I hope is not the case, but it was the case last year when other needs jumped ahead of the headquarters, the fire headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1040.305s">So</a> I'm concerned now that we're putting off immediate needs with the expectation that in year 2024, we may get a new station, a new headquarters, but that remains unseen. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1053.835s">We</a> don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1054.895s">So</a> we're kind of kicking the can down the street once again on the headquarters and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1060.621s">I</a> realize we don't want to put good money after bad money into the headquarters if it's going to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1066.183s">But</a> I think the immediate needs, Chief, that we saw, the front of the facade that's pulling away from the building, the bathrooms that were in poor condition, as you know, the kitchen that's close to where the apparatus parks and contagions and everything else in the living quarters where these firefighters are. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1084.027s">You</a> know, I think these issues, although they're probably costly, need to be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1090.29s">And</a> I'm hoping that under your leadership, Chief, that the fire headquarters is not last on the list, but should be first, Mr. Chief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1182.682s">Right,</a> so that's what I mean about kicking the can down the street on a building we already know, you know, it was housed where the police department was housed, and in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1193.341s">was</a> in no better shape than the police department, which we condemned that building more or less and built a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1202.485s">So</a> I just want to put that out there, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1204.626s">I</a> know the brave men and women of the fire department deserve no less. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1209.168s">And</a> I'm glad to see after all these years of the council and residents talking about the condition, as well as the firefighters, the condition of the buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1218.905s">that</a> at least something's being acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1221.548s">So</a> I'm pleased to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1223.65s">I</a> just hope we're able to get to each building and the needs that they have Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1227.414s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2661.547s">Yes</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2681.151s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2682.331s">And</a> I want to thank the number of residents that came out to attend this public meeting here tonight of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2691.374s">After</a> attending the March 31st ad hoc small cell committee public hearing, I am concerned that corporate grade <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2699.096s">and</a> commercial benefits of 5G will outweigh the potential long-term health effects of 5G on our residents, home values, and environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2709.604s">Method</a> must delay any wireless build-out until the law and public policy catch up to the science. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2718.171s">The</a> Federal Communication Commission's declaratory ruling effectively tied the hands <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2724.255s">of</a> local municipalities to make decisions best for their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2730.08s">The</a> city is prohibited from taking any action that is seen as prohibiting Verizon's 5G rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2739.208s">Verizon</a> representatives at one point during the hearing told Method residents unequivocally <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2746.311s">that</a> the FCC regulations would not allow for health concerns to be discussed as a reason for not approving their applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2756.916s">This</a> comment, true or not, is outrageous and requires a formal complaint be filed with the FCC and our congressional representatives on behalf of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2769.863s">The</a> city, in my opinion, was ill prepared for the much anticipated 5G hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2777.0s">not</a> presenting one subject matter expert to represent our city's interest and its residents, and only relied on the one-sided Verizon paid expert witnesses in which there were many. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2794.149s">The</a> city has not requested any potential mitigation from Verizon to address further disenfranchisement of the communities in Method who can least afford Verizon's <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2806.929s">new</a> 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2808.891s">At</a> the very least, Method should request Verizon provide free Wi-Fi to our communities of need, as well as schools, senior housing, and low-income housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2822.422s">5G</a> will substantially increase resonant exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2829.869s">This</a> has been proven to be harmful to humans and the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2834.278s">We</a> need to engage the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2835.699s">government</a> to require the FCC to do an independent study of radio frequency standards and health risks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2844.343s">We</a> should support the recommendations of the 400 scientists and medical doctors who signed the 5G appeal that calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2857.768s">and</a> demand our government officials fund the research needed to adopt biologically based exposure limits that protect the health and safety of our residents and environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2870.291s">Human</a> exposure guidelines for radio frequency used by the FCC are more than 20 years old and address only thermal, not biological impact of exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2882.895s">Over</a> the past 20 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2884.818s">A</a> robust body of independent science has emerged showing significant biological impacts from exposure to radiofrequency microwave radiation, including clear evidence of cancer, neurological and cognitive harm, heart abnormalities, and reproductive effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2905.808s">Populations</a> especially at risk include pregnant women, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2910.071s">Children,</a> the elderly, individuals with implanted medical devices, or cardiac or neurological problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2919.755s">Mr.</a> President, at that particular hearing, I asked a number of questions of the committee, as well as many residents, of which many remain unanswered at this particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2932.38s">I</a> am going to offer a number of questions that were asked at that meeting with the hopes <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2939.246s">that</a> we will be able to get answers prior to the Thursday meeting that the Small Ad Hoc Subcommittee will have to go over the remaining 43 applications that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2956.21s">Question</a> number one, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2962.725s">for</a> co-sponsoring this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2964.486s">He's</a> been there every step of the way and I appreciate his support in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2967.849s">I</a> know he has a lot to add as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2971.151s">Question</a> number one, the city's interim policy under the application process states, for residential areas, guidelines on structure height, lengths and minimum setback rules from dwellings, parks or playgrounds or similar recreational areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2990.103s">I</a> asked that question last Thursday, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2993.866s">What</a> are the setback guidelines that were created under this interim policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2999.33s">And</a> to date, there has not been one setback guideline in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3005.014s">So</a> we don't know what the minimum setback. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3007.255s">We</a> heard from residents, and I think there's a resident here tonight, the small cell that they're going to put on the pole in front of his house is about 10 feet from a bedroom window. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3020.316s">This</a> admits, Mr. President, harmful, in my opinion, harmful exposure and radio frequency to residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3029.842s">We</a> don't know what the impact is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3032.324s">There</a> hasn't been enough studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3034.425s">There's</a> enough reading out there, and I must add on both sides, but we don't know what the studies are. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3041.429s">Why</a> are we going to move forward hastily <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3044.741s">without</a> knowing what the impact is, the health impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3048.002s">Whether</a> the FCC allows it or not, we are here to represent our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3054.143s">The</a> FCC doesn't care about the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3059.124s">We</a> are here, that's our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3061.584s">And</a> we'd be negligent not to bring these up, these questions, and ask for answers before approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3068.606s">So</a> that's question number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3070.401s">Question</a> number two, under the city's interim policy, the applicant must provide a description as to why the desired location is superior to other similar locations from a community perspective, including proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks, and playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3090.51s">Verizon</a> submitted their location selection criteria for each of the 44 applications stating it is not directly adjacent to a park, school, or playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3103.202s">And</a> I asked this question last Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3106.345s">Why</a> did they omit dwelling? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3109.648s">Why</a> does their location criteria <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3114.389s">not</a> in line with the city's interim policy that states it should be dwellings, schools, and parks, their location selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3123.255s">They</a> left out, Mr. President, dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3125.936s">You</a> know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3127.017s">Because</a> many of these are within yards of dwellings, bedrooms, front porches, play areas where kids are, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3136.483s">My</a> next question, Mr. President, and I hope these questions don't fall on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3141.446s">I</a> know we have a meeting Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3143.902s">And</a> we got a robo call and we were already told by some members of that committee that they don't want any further discussion at this next meeting, which is outrageous, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3156.589s">Outrageous</a> at a public meeting to say you're going to pick and choose what public input you're going to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3162.972s">Outrageous,</a> especially for a department head to make that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3167.506s">My</a> next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3168.747s">Under</a> the current interim policy, the applicant is required to provide a certificate of liability insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3175.25s">The</a> policies submitted by Verizon currently are all expired for each of the 44 petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3183.754s">I</a> brought that up at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3185.675s">The</a> chair of the meeting thanked me for bringing that to his attention, and then proceeded to say they can make that a condition of approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3194.959s">Anyone</a> else, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3196.744s">If</a> you wanted to file for a license in this building or an application to build, they would not let a submission of an incomplete application move forward, except for 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3211.792s">They'll</a> make that a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3214.353s">Unacceptable,</a> Mr. President, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3221.097s">Amendments,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3222.398s">Those</a> were, I'm sorry, I have a few more questions on the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3226.894s">Next</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3228.495s">How</a> are the neighborhoods being chosen by Verizon for the 5G rollout? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3234.46s">Wasn't</a> my question at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3236.021s">A</a> lot of residents asked Verizon representatives, why did you start off with the rollout with these particular neighborhoods? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3244.848s">We</a> could not get an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3246.47s">We</a> could not get a straight answer, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3250.072s">In</a> my opinion, the neighborhoods that they picked out <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3254.946s">We're</a> going to be the neighborhoods with least resistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3259.809s">My</a> personal opinion, which I'm entitled to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3263.351s">I</a> also believe, Mr. President, if you talk to anyone in this community, and they'll tell you when they drive through certain sections of this city, that they lose their phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3274.018s">They</a> lose their internet service. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3276.96s">And</a> by the way, it's not in the areas where they're rolling out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3281.762s">It's</a> in other areas that they're not rolling out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3284.977s">that</a> are the most complaint driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3288.098s">That</a> says a lot about this process, because the minute they get 5G in this community, it's gonna be extremely difficult for the other 150 applications, which are coming, this is 44, there's gonna be another 150 and maybe two or 300 after that from other carriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3307.362s">Once</a> they get their foot in the door, there's gonna be no stopping them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3312.096s">And</a> that's what they're looking for Thursday to get their foot in the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3319.903s">The</a> next question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3321.284s">So</a> I'd like to know why they selected those particular neighborhoods for the rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3327.069s">I</a> believe it was South Method, Method Square, and the Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3332.469s">The</a> city's interim policy under aesthetics and requirements states each small cell wireless infrastructure antenna should be located entirely within a shroud or canister type enclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3348.54s">Why</a> is the ad hoc small cell committee not following the city's interim policy and allowing Verizon not to locate these devices in a shroud or a canister? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3360.45s">Why</a> are they allowing a condition of approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3364.813s">Why</a> did they ask Verizon what their preference was? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3368.576s">Why</a> are other cities like Cambridge stating that every single cell that they're putting up will be enclosed in a shroud or a canister? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3379.004s">But</a> here in Medford, it's fine to ask Verizon, the petitioner, what's your preference? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3385.689s">And</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3386.91s">They</a> prefer not to have it enclosed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3392.81s">My</a> last question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3395.911s">There's</a> four members of the board, this small ad hoc committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3399.933s">They're</a> all department heads here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3402.194s">And</a> I must say, this is a very, very difficult decision for them to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3408.677s">It</a> may sound like an easy decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3410.298s">It's</a> not an easy decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3412.379s">Our</a> hand is tied. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3414.5s">And</a> we really should be looking at our federal delegation, our congressman, a woman, and our senator. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3422.711s">or</a> our senators to be asking for relief, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3427.433s">But</a> why, out of the four representatives, when they took the first vote, which they approved, was the vote three to one? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3435.616s">Three</a> in favor, one against. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3438.237s">The</a> one against, Mr. President, in my opinion, did not state a reason why they were against. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3445.54s">And</a> that one person was the director of the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3450.642s">That</a> should be concerning <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3452.25s">for</a> every resident of this community, and I'd like to know what the reasoning is for the Board of Health Director to state that she was against these 5G small cells within our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3467.993s">That's</a> an important thing, and I'd like to know why, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3473.294s">I</a> have eight amendments, if you could just bear with me, and I'd like to go through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3479.256s">I</a> know the clerk does a great job capturing these, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3481.758s">I</a> feel comfortable that this is all being captured. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3484.999s">I'd</a> like to make a motion, Mr. President, my first amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3487.8s">The</a> city's interim policy should be updated to include a cap on the number of 5G installations allowed in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3498.064s">Currently,</a> there is no cap at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3500.545s">You</a> can locate 10,000 of these in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3503.747s">There</a> is no cap, no restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3507.088s">So</a> I would ask that as my first motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3511.089s">The</a> second motion, the city's interim policy should establish setback guidelines to address the distance small cell wireless facilities can be placed from residential housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3524.633s">So</a> before we move forward, before we take any other vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3529.062s">Those</a> guidelines, we've had plenty of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3531.464s">This</a> policy has been in effect since 2019 from the previous administration and currently 15 to 16 months with this current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3541.713s">The</a> interim policy was created by Mayor Burke at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3545.036s">It's</a> a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3546.337s">It's</a> not a city ordinance that would be created by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3549.84s">It's</a> an interim city policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3554.858s">So</a> that would be my second motion, Mr. President, the guidelines and distance from housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3561.504s">Third</a> motion, amend city's interim policy to include the following language. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3568.191s">In</a> residential zoning districts, installations should not be placed directly in front of a residential home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3577.199s">Where</a> there is a side yard setback with open space or other space, preference should be given to applications to locate an installation on the public way in front of a side yard setback. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3591.509s">I</a> didn't create that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3592.29s">I</a> wish I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3593.531s">That's</a> in the city of Cambridge's policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3600.976s">Mr.</a> Clerk, if you don't get all this, I have it in writing so I can give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3605.459s">Fourth</a> motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3607.23s">The</a> city amended its interim policy to create a location requirement which lists the most preferable locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3617.454s">Right</a> now, we don't have such policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3619.834s">The</a> following are the most preferred location areas for 5G installation in order of preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3627.117s">Industrial</a> districts, number one, if not adjacent to a park, playground, school, residential district, or historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3637.981s">The</a> second most preferred location, public rights of way areas, if not adjacent to a park, playground, school, residential district, or historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3653.325s">Motion</a> number five, amend the city's interim policy to include the following language. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3660.087s">No</a> application may seek approval for more than five proposed facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3668.211s">No</a> applicant or closely held applicant may file more than two applications within a 60 day of one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3679.113s">So</a> right now we have 44 applications that were filed, if not all the same day, within a day or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3687.455s">Other</a> communities state no one application can have more than five and no applicant <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3695.253s">may</a> file more than two applications, so that would be 10 within a 60-day period. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3701.576s">How</a> did we end up with 44 with another 150 to come, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3707.339s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3708.599s">Because</a> our interim policy, for better words, stinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3713.562s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3714.662s">It</a> stinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3720.725s">But</a> it can be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3723.406s">Motion</a> number six. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3725.472s">to</a> request the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee not approve any more 5G applications until the city has ample time to review questions and policy comments submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3741.503s">Be</a> it further requested, the city consult with its own 5G subject matter experts regarding issues of concern raised by residents regarding health and safety setbacks <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3754.745s">FCC</a> 5G regulations, potential mitigation, and other issues of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3762.33s">So</a> I'm asking for a vote tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3764.431s">We</a> can separate these motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3766.372s">I'd</a> like to do them all at once, but I have all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3769.514s">We'll</a> take a vote on each. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3771.375s">But</a> this motion is asking that we send a message Thursday night to the ad hoc committee <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3777.955s">No</a> different than the message we sent, Mr. President, to the Zoning Board of Appeals back so many years ago when this council stood up and we thought that the Zoning Board of Appeals extended relief to a developer that hurt a neighborhood that we sued our own Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3800.51s">If</a> Verizon doesn't like it, bring it on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3804.513s">Bring</a> it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3805.373s">Lawsuits</a> don't scare me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3807.295s">Bring</a> it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3808.646s">What</a> scares me is health concerns in our community and not being at the table and being able to have input. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3814.528s">Motion</a> number seven, request our federal delegation calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G and fund the research needed to adopt biologically based exposure limits that protect the health and safety of our residents and the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3834.254s">That</a> is crucial, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3838.629s">That</a> has to catch up with the science, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3841.029s">Currently,</a> the FCC is working off 20-year-old information, and there's much more information that has been updated over the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3852.571s">Currently,</a> Mr. President, another amendment, the city's policy states, and I offer this as an amendment, only one small cell wireless facility shall be eligible to be approved on a poll and support structure in the <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3867.901s">this</a> is the town of Burlington, and this is what they state. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3872.543s">So</a> the town of Burlington states only one wireless on each pole, for each provider. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3879.527s">I'm</a> sorry, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3883.428s">And</a> that makes sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3885.489s">However,</a> many communities require co-sharing, and they write it right into their policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3891.672s">So</a> if Verizon wants to come in and you see the ads for AT&T now all over about 5G, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3898.001s">They're</a> coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3899.382s">There's</a> no doubt about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3900.222s">They're</a> coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3901.943s">And</a> to allow them to go on separate polls means they're going to be in front of every hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3907.806s">You</a> can guarantee they'll be in front of every hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3910.227s">So</a> at least if we can safeguard, if these are going to be installed, which I'm opposed to, that my motion would read, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3917.156s">It</a> is the town's strong preference, on this case the city, that whenever an applicant poses to place a new small wireless facility, that the applicant co-locate the same on an existing wireless support structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3933.203s">And</a> I would ask that that be adopted into our interim policy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3939.065s">And</a> the last thing I just want to give <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3940.956s">is</a> notification like I did last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3943.678s">There</a> was over 160 residents that were on the Zoom call. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3949.346s">on</a> March 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3952.388s">160,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3953.969s">You</a> really, very seldom, I attend a lot of hearings, meetings, very seldom see the like of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3959.833s">And</a> let me tell you, if you had it on Zoom and opened it up to the public, that small ad hoc subcommittee should be meeting here at the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3969.439s">If</a> this is not big enough, let's meet at Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3972.06s">If</a> that's not big enough, let's meet at the Bosch at Karen Theater at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3977.248s">all</a> handicap accessible, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3981.209s">So</a> I don't want to hear the excuse about COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3984.83s">We</a> can accommodate and also accommodate the social distancing requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=3990.831s">So</a> that alone, Mr. President, we had 160 on Zoom and we shut out many people that would love, that don't have access, that would love to come up like we have up here tonight and also participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4001.913s">Many</a> seniors that have concerns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4005.151s">And</a> again, I would respectfully ask the committee, they're under no obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4009.793s">They</a> can continue the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4010.913s">They</a> already continued it once from the 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4013.614s">They</a> can continue it again to have an open public forum where people can attend in public as well as Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4020.837s">I</a> don't want people to start calling me up and saying, I'm trying to discourage Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4024.478s">I'm</a> not discouraging Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4026.899s">I'm</a> saying add another avenue for people that may not access Zoom or may not want to use Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4033.766s">We</a> can do it in a safe fashion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4036.908s">So</a> I would ask anyone that's in shouting distance that this Thursday, April 8th at 6.30, the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee will meet once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4046.755s">And</a> the meeting is a continuation of the meeting originally begun on March 31st at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4057.902s">And</a> it's a continuation <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4059.557s">of</a> the public hearing for Verizon applications for 43 proposed small cell infrastructures in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4069.309s">And</a> I would also state, Mr. President, that if anyone tells you on that committee they're only hearing certain testimony <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4078.687s">only</a> allowing certain public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4081.549s">If</a> you already spoke, unless this is directed directly in front of your house, they're not going to allow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4087.613s">They</a> are in violation as far as I'm concerned, of the open meeting law and allowing for public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4094.879s">They're</a> in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4097.38s">There's</a> no way that states that you can only speak one time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4102.044s">There's</a> no way that states that you have to be directly impacted to speak in a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4112.401s">The</a> Zoom information, meeting ID, for those that want to go on Zoom, 933-7697-5064. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4126.208s">And</a> the passcode, they really don't want people to get on, because usually you go on a Zoom meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4132.151s">This</a> has a passcode on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4133.692s">035-999.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4135.933s">And</a> the dial-in number, which you can, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4144.651s">929-205-6099.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4145.231s">Mr.</a> President, I know there's a fair amount of residents here today that took the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4152.535s">I</a> know Councilor Scarpelli, which co-sponsored this resolution, and we spent much time going through many of the recommendations here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4163.301s">And</a> I'll let him speak for himself, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4165.683s">And</a> I want to thank my council colleagues for indulging me on this very important matter, Mr. President, of safety and awareness in this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4190.893s">So</a> question number three, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4194.269s">Under</a> the current interim policy, the applicant is required to provide a certificate of liability insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4202.075s">The</a> policies submitted by Verizon are expired. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4204.917s">They</a> were submitted when they originally filed the petitions back in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4210.261s">And</a> the life on these was a year, and many of them were from just say June 2019 to, you know, the end of, yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4222.785s">May</a> of 2020.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4228.746s">That</a> is a requirement of the interim policy.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4231.587s">So,</a> you know, and they weren't aware of it until I brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4234.628s">And</a> that's a very important, it may seem like a small thing, but insurance certificate of liability is a very important thing to safeguard our residents, our poles, safety walking underneath these poles, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4248.29s">I</a> appreciate you bringing that up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4259.223s">I</a> will do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4260.363s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=956.618s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=957.579s">I</a> want to thank the Board of Health Director for being on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=960.54s">Mary</a> Ann, could you give us a brief update on where we stand with our application to be a mass vaccination site? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=967.164s">And</a> where do we stand with the Tufts University proposal?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1059.881s">Okay,</a> and I'm sure you're aware of this, but the number one call I'm receiving is the fact that residents have to go outside the city to get their shots, many of which that may be homebound or unable to travel too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1075.625s">So</a> the quicker we can get this on board, and I realize there's a lot of moving parts, so I'm not pointing the finger at the city, but the quicker we can get a local vaccination site <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1086.056s">on</a> board would be beneficial to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1089.459s">In</a> particular, we're gonna be opening up, I guess, for everyone over the age of 16, is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1097.104s">Sometime</a> at the end of April or May. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1100.366s">And</a> I think the numbers that are gonna need the shot are gonna quadruple in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1106.571s">And</a> I'm a little concerned that we're not gonna have anything set up by that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1111.694s">So</a> I just wanted to put that out there.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1139.708s">So</a> are we working with agencies that deal with people that are homebound? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1144.899s">to</a> reach out and do some proactive outreach in our community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1155.507s">So</a> Marianne, what percent do you think we identified of having their first or second shot in the community that are homebound?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1225.887s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1226.448s">So</a> that's excellent work, but I'm not quite sure that I would list it as great because I don't know the total overall number of homebound residents in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1239.091s">And</a> if we're talking, you know, vaccinating 10% of them, to me, that's not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1245.113s">So</a> it's really hard for me to put a handle on this until I have, and I realize you're not going to get exact numbers, but do we know what percent that is?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1285.653s">So</a> we're really not able to measure a success rate of <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1289.474s">outreach</a> and making sure our most vulnerable population is getting vaccinated.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1324.194s">I'm</a> just trying to figure out what our numbers are in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1327.535s">When</a> I turn on the news, and they tell me throughout the state X number of seniors are already vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1334.437s">I</a> think I saw a number tonight 16% of <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1338.566s">Massachusetts,</a> the entire population now has a second second vaccination, which sounds like there's progress happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1346.889s">But</a> I'm just trying to get a handle on our own numbers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1361.233s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1361.749s">but</a> that doesn't include homebound or may include a portion of homebound.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1375.681s">Okay,</a> so you're saying 76% of what we have recorded have received the second dose.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1387.351s">Say</a> that again, sorry, I didn't get it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1407.18s">Okay,</a> well, I didn't know that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1409.922s">That's</a> good to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1411.303s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1681.5s">Why</a> not?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1830.329s">Hi,</a> Mr. Mallon, how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1832.651s">So</a> I've looked at all of your documents, everything seems in order, but I mean, to keep it simple and streamlined, could you give us just a brief synopsis of what's happening with the site that's there now and what you plan to be doing there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1849.066s">I</a> believe it's just a turnover, but if you can explain it, that'd be great.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1894.159s">Okay,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1894.659s">That's</a> all I just want to be clear just because I, um, the way you answered it might've sounded as if you were adding something new, but this is just an existing, um, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1905.197s">a</a> body shop, a repair garage that is just changing over, hours operations staying the same, parking for your vehicles are staying the same, everything seems to be in order, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1918.043s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1919.243s">Okay,</a> so everything else I see, Mr. President, all of this paperwork is in order, every department has signed off on it favorably, so I would move approval, pending any questions from my fellow councilors.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2902.901s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2903.121s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2905.062s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2906.223s">And</a> I want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2911.026s">I'm</a> glad to hear what I've been preaching about for the last 20 years about the MBTA and the assessment that it's starting to actually finally get some traction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2920.851s">because</a> I've offered several resolutions before the city council requesting that the millions of dollars in tax exempt property that the MBTA has offset what they're charging us for millions of dollars on the cherry sheet, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2936.394s">So,</a> you know, I think it's about time we take a look at the services we're receiving in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2942.455s">And</a> let's face it, many people come to the city of Medford because of our transportation services, and they're not paying the additional <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2950.317s">tax</a> on their cherry sheet, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2952.639s">Based</a> on that, we are as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2955.141s">The</a> T has three different revenue sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2958.684s">One</a> is the percent of the sales tax that they get. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2962.467s">Another</a> one is the fares when you go onto the train or the bus, which has been hit because of COVID, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2971.054s">But</a> I think what we have to do is take a long, hard look at what we're actually paying now, several million dollars a year, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2978.342s">for</a> service in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2980.103s">And</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2981.063s">That</a> assessment the T is assessing us, it's only gonna get higher with the green line. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2986.565s">And</a> so I think we really need to take a close hard look at why our assessment is so high in this community and why the T, as my colleagues mentioned, continue to cut routes and much needed buses that impact the most vulnerable community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3003.618s">Many</a> of us don't have to worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3005.279s">We</a> get in the car and we go to stop and shop, or we go to a convenience store. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3009.28s">We</a> do our shopping and we get around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3011.5s">There</a> are many other ones of us, Mr. President, that rely on public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3017.342s">And</a> to have a population in particular with this route is in the heights, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3023.817s">This</a> is gonna really impact, even if it impacts dozens of people, that's a huge impact, Mr. President, when it comes to needs that we just heard about getting to and from Wegmans and stop and shop in the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3037.908s">These</a> are dedicated stops on that route for the 710 bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3043.193s">And</a> that's not just a luxury when you're going to a doctor, when you're going to get food, that's a necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3050.131s">And</a> that's something that really shouldn't be cut, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3053.413s">I</a> just heard the news, the city of Boston is fighting now the MBTA cuts in the city of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3059.096s">And</a> I agree, we have to get more vocal as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3063.118s">You</a> know, it's great to send out a letter to the T and the head of the T, and then they respond back saying, we'll look into it, we'll investigate and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3070.842s">And</a> then it ends there to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3073.124s">There's</a> never any follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3074.965s">We</a> have to take action, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3077.953s">And</a> I don't know what it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3080.616s">Maybe</a> we have to sit at the table and refuse to give the $3 million or so that we give on the cherry sheet every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3089.964s">Maybe</a> we'll be the first city in the state to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3092.606s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3093.107s">But</a> it takes bold action sometimes to get bold results. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3097.23s">And</a> I'm willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3098.972s">And</a> I've been talking about this issue for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3102.097s">And</a> when, you know, and I brought up before fell on deaf ears, no one wanted to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3106.158s">Now</a> the team's making some big service cuts and all of a sudden it's the topic of conversation, the cherry sheet and why we're paying so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3115.16s">So</a> I'm glad to hear that's it, Mr. President, but these are things that should have been looked at over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3120.481s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3316.076s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3317.557s">And</a> this is a very important issue that we will be confronted with in the very near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3324.201s">And</a> that is losing affordable housing within our community after so much talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3330.823s">how</a> we increase our affordable housing stock here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3336.287s">According</a> to the city's draft housing production plan, which I think we're all gonna receive a copy of very shortly, there are 35 HUD subsidized affordable rental units in Method that are set to expire in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3351.657s">It's</a> only a mere year and a half, two years away, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3356.74s">And</a> those units, those 35 units are located at <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3361.277s">42</a> Water Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3363.178s">And</a> there's another three that are subsidized by DHCD, Department of Housing and Community Development, which are run by Tri-City Housing Task Force for the homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3374.523s">And</a> they're at 196, 198 Fellsway, and they're set to expire in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3379.785s">So</a> that's a total of 38 units that are subsidized, Mr. President, for low income residents that could potentially be lost <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3390.342s">in</a> this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3391.562s">And</a> in my opinion, that is extremely sizable and something, Mr. President, I am going to fight hard to make sure we maintain. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3401.405s">And</a> there is a way of maintaining it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3403.866s">And</a> I'm hoping that we can get some answers from this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3408.167s">But</a> the affordability of privately owned affordable housing units that were produced using state or federal housing resources can expire as owners pay off their subsidized mortgages. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3420.62s">or</a> opt out of their existing Section 8 rental subsidy contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3424.764s">When</a> such affordability restrictions expire, property owners can convert the affordable units to market-rate housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3432.21s">On</a> November 23, 2009, the governor signed a general law, Chapter 40T, which is an act preserving publicly-assisted affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3442.9s">And</a> what this legislation did, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3445.62s">was</a> aimed at helping preserve existing privately owned affordable housing in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3453.387s">It</a> also established notification provisions for tenants along with modest tenant protections, very modest, I should add, and terminate the right of first refusal for DHCD or its designee to purchase publicly <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3474.271s">assisted</a> housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3476.092s">I</a> was never aware of this law, Mr. President, and maybe because we haven't seen the likes of so many housing units coming up, affordable housing units, coming up at once in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3488.62s">But</a> if you read Chapter 40T, Section 3, which deals specifically regarding the right of first refusal for DHCD, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3500.271s">and</a> the ability to sign a designee if someone is interested, i.e., in particular, a municipality, if they are interested in becoming the designee to publicly purchase the affordable housing before it gets on the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3517.323s">And</a> I found that very interesting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3519.785s">If</a> I could, it's pretty brief, and it's part of my motion, so I'd just like to read what, for the edification of the viewing audience and my colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3529.914s">section</a> three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3531.474s">It</a> says an owner shall offer the department an opportunity, when they say department they refer to DHCD, an opportunity to purchase publicly assisted housing prior to entering into an agreement to sell such property pursuant to the time periods contained in this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3549.838s">But</a> no owner shall be under any obligation to enter into an agreement to sell such property to the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3557.93s">Then</a> it goes on subsection B. The department may select a designee, that's DHCD, to act on its behalf as purchaser of the publicly assisted housing and shall give the owner written notice of its selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3573.858s">So</a> my first motion, Mr. President, is has DHCD selected a designee as purchaser? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3583.122s">So</a> that's my first motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3585.677s">The</a> section goes on to say the department shall probably consult with the affected municipality before selecting a designee and shall immediately designate the affected municipality as a designee upon written request of the affected municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3605.108s">Motion</a> number two, has DHCD reached out to the city of Medford and has the city of Medford expressed interest in becoming the designee <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3615.054s">for</a> these two particular properties, which is 42 Water Street and 196-198 Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3625.257s">And</a> then it goes on to say, unless the department determines that such request is not feasible for the reasons set forth in the department's regulations, the department shall enter into a written agreement with its selection designee, providing that the designee and any of its successors assigns <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3643.982s">agreed</a> to preserve the affordability of the publicly assisted housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3648.783s">Once</a> such an agreement is executed, the designee shall assume all rights and responsibilities attributable to the department as a prospective purchaser under this section, section four. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3662.086s">My</a> next motion, Mr. President, is that we create a committee of the whole meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3667.774s">I</a> believe we have one scheduled for next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3671.415s">So</a> if that's the case, Mr. President, that would suffice for my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3676.097s">But</a> my motion is that the city council meet and committee the whole to discuss options for preserving the existing privately owned publicly assisted affordable housing and method and review housing production per housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3694.064s">And</a> as part of the motion, it's to invite <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3696.67s">the</a> consultant that was hired by the city, Jen Golson, from the firm of J.M. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3702.174s">Golson,</a> and to invite our consultant attorney, Bob Bobrovsky, to be a part of that meeting, Mr. President, to discuss what our next steps are so we don't use or lose this opportunity for maintaining our affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3721.387s">One</a> other portion I'd like to bring up, Mr. President of NLN, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3726.55s">Many</a> people realize Chapter 40B establishes a goal that every Massachusetts community must work to provide affordable housing at a minimum of 10% of their overall housing stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3738.595s">And</a> if you read the housing production plan, you will notice, Mr. President, on page 82 of the draft plan, it states that Medford has four 40B projects currently right now in the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3753.962s">If</a> all four of these projects come to fruition, Method will have an additional 1,087 units eligible to be counted on the subsidized housing inventory, bringing the city's portion of the subsidized housing inventory units to 11.7%, which would be above the 10% better right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3776.826s">Many</a> people are eager to move on from 40B, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3781.541s">The</a> true hard facts is the only way we really been making significant change in this community for affordability has been through the state law, chapter 40B, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3793.689s">That's</a> where we've added the most affordable housing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3796.951s">There</a> are other ways which the housing production plan addresses and that's something we're reviewing as a council, but I would strongly ask the administration because they are looking at these 40B projects <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3810.99s">in</a> court right now, I would strongly ask that they take a closer look, Mr. President, at what these units can bring to our community in regards to affordability and move forward on these 40B projects in the interest of adding more affordability in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3831.357s">And</a> that's all I have, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3835.678s">And</a> tax revenue, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3838.279s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3875.284s">I'm</a> not opposed to that, Mr. President, but according to J.M. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3879.005s">Golson</a> report, this 120 page report, they listed those two particular properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3886.847s">I'm</a> not sure maybe because they're the most recent, but I would hope this is a thorough report <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3892.652s">but</a> I am not opposed to looking at, you know, this all 10 years, I am not opposed to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3897.756s">We</a> have to plan and I think that's a worthy suggestion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3927.204s">Councilor</a> Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3928.624s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3929.685s">Councilor</a> Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3930.425s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3931.106s">Vice</a> President Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3932.347s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3932.787s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3933.547s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3933.987s">Councilor</a> Morell? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3934.908s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3935.869s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3936.709s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3937.209s">President</a> Caraviello?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3946.397s">Next</a> Tuesday, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3949.799s">So</a> as one of my motions, we can meet that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3952.761s">We</a> don't have to meet a separate night to discuss that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3955.643s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3979.917s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3981.218s">If</a> we all recall, our former esteemed councilor, Councilor Bob Penta, appeared under community participation a few weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3990.806s">At</a> that time, the council requested that the city council take a vote on several requests for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3998.552s">However,</a> because it was offered under public participation, we could not take a formal vote <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4003.703s">and</a> I recommended that we put it on the agenda so we can take a formal vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4008.424s">So</a> at this point, Mr. President, I would welcome up former councilor Penta for his presentation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4541.141s">I</a> think, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4548.191s">fellow</a> cops can help, but the committee that you're referring to, is this the traffic committee that the mayor just put together? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4555.773s">Is</a> that the committee you're referencing?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4562.594s">Okay,</a> so I believe they said that they had no privy to discuss anything dealing with Republic Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4568.775s">I</a> believe that's what they, that's what was quoted to us that when we asked questions about Republic Park to them, that they were directed not to, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4577.421s">that</a> wasn't what they were looking to do.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4851.771s">Isn't</a> this the transparency administration though? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4854.253s">It's</a> supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4855.333s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4857.154s">Councilor</a> Locks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4858.655s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4859.496s">I</a> wanna thank my colleague, Councilor Penta for his insight on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4866.254s">You</a> know, when the mayor first established this working committee, I was under the impression they were going to look at the parking program in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4877.577s">And</a> I did hear bits and pieces of what their mission statement is, but I wasn't aware that they're not going to look at the current entity that oversees parking, which is Park Medford in this community and their contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4892.162s">I</a> wasn't aware that <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4893.646s">They</a> weren't going to look at taking this service in-house, which has been an issue since, as Councilor Penta mentioned, since 2009, when the committee I sat on for two years, Mr. President, we visited, we did our due diligence, we did our homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4909.938s">We</a> went to the city of Boston and met with their chief parking clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4913.96s">We</a> went to Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4915.181s">We</a> went to Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4916.222s">We</a> went to Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4917.883s">We</a> spent countless hours and came up with recommendations, Mr. President, all of which <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4923.769s">were</a> to do meters and take the service in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4927.71s">Those</a> are the major recommendations of which the mayor at the time, and that's his authority, decided to do neither. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4936.532s">And</a> he hired an outside company and he put kiosks all over the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4940.953s">So</a> what we spent two years for, he did the total opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4944.793s">Now</a> I'm hoping, Mr. President, because as Councilor Penta mentioned, there was a commitment made by this current mayor back in 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4952.591s">that</a> seniors were going to get free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4955.913s">It's</a> 15 months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4958.174s">Seniors</a> have not received free parking, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4962.056s">Elimination</a> of the kiosk, 15 months later, and taking it in-house, parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4970.72s">Now</a> come to find out it's not even a subject of discussion among the committee that she handpicked and appointed, Mr. President, to discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4981.075s">the</a> parking program in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4983.898s">She</a> may decide to do this outside of that, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4987.3s">But</a> what better time when they have in public hearings, public meetings, sending out surveys, spending countless hours working on this to discuss the program in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4999.61s">It</a> makes zero sense to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5002.87s">So</a> I wait with bated breath in June when this report's supposed to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5008.333s">Not</a> to belabor the subject, Mr. President, but I think it was two or three years ago, the city hired a consultant and spent close to $100,000 to look at resident permit parking in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5021.862s">And</a> the consultant came out with a report, it's probably worth all the other reports, collecting dust. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5028.168s">But</a> this consultant came out with a report and stated that we'd like to do a pilot program because the city is so diverse in their parking needs, and we'd like to start off with Salt Method and the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5040.33s">And</a> they made recommendations on creating a Salt Method hillside permit parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5046.471s">And</a> what did the city do with the $100,000 report? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5050.972s">Circular</a> file. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5054.813s">And</a> here we are back at the table again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5058.257s">Are</a> we here just because it's election year, and we have to keep up with campaign promises, and we're going through the motions? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5065.442s">Or</a> do we really want to see change to this program that's needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5069.785s">It</a> hasn't been tweaked in more than seven years, this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5074.709s">And</a> it needs tweaking, Mr. President, a lot of tweaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5078.632s">And</a> I supported at the time, and I still stand by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5082.068s">in-house,</a> taking this in-house and having our own people control this program, Mr. President, and the revenue stays here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5088.994s">And</a> I supported at the time, and I still do, having double head meters rather than kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5095.34s">Kiosks</a> are great for parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5097.142s">They</a> don't work on the streets, Mr. President, as we found out from the number of complaints throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5103.127s">So</a> I want to thank my colleague for putting this on and for bringing up this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5107.671s">And</a> I hope in June, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5109.351s">This</a> is something that we discussed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5111.833s">We</a> have the fire report that was just issued that the mayor commissioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5115.216s">We</a> haven't gone through that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5116.818s">That</a> comes out with a list of recommendations and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5120.241s">So</a> there's a lot of reporting going on, Mr. President, but very little action. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5124.204s">A</a> lot of reports, you can hire consultants, put together reports, but they're meaningless if there's nothing tied to them, if there's no action. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5133.232s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5134.173s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5136.28s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Scott Ville.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5203.192s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5205.952s">If</a> I could, I mean, in the past when a representative of the council is selected by the mayor to be on a committee, ad hoc committee, whatever you want to call it, they usually report back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5218.355s">And</a> we have yet to receive any report back <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5220.762s">from</a> our representative on the board, and maybe there's nothing to report back now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5225.244s">I</a> don't know, they've been meeting for several months, but I think it would be interesting, rather than pointing us to a website on the city website, is to give us an update, Mr. President, on what's happening, and things that we should be made aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5238.79s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1489.924s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1490.624s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1492.625s">And</a> I too want to thank the brave men and women of the police department for all they do on behalf of our community in these trying times. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1500.928s">It's</a> not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1502.165s">to</a> be a public safety official. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1504.626s">And</a> they've been doing tremendous work on behalf of keeping our residents safe as well as their personal property. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1513.729s">And</a> it doesn't go unrecognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1516.129s">Chief,</a> I had just a couple of basic questions that I was wondering if you can answer, not regarding crime statistics, but a general follow up from the meeting that we had, this council met on site <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1530.795s">on</a> Fulton Spring Road back some several months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1533.816s">And</a> I know along with the Traffic Commission and yourself, there's been much improvement made to that area regarding signage, regarding pedestrian crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1546.065s">And</a> one thing that I think we still need to follow up, Chief, and I've had this discussion with you, was regarding resident-only access on Fels Ave, Fulton Spring Road, Murray Hill Road, Fels Ave Terrace, Grover Road, and that particular vicinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1564.7s">I</a> understand that some of the state roads lead into that road, and it may be difficult to put signs, but I think that's one missing component <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1574.392s">of</a> creating an area. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1575.653s">I</a> think we promised residents that we were going to try to eliminate the cut through traffic the best way we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1584.116s">And</a> I think the resident only access <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1587.253s">may</a> not be a solve all, but it'll definitely help. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1590.274s">So</a> that is my first question, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1592.575s">And</a> I know you said you're going to review and look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1594.596s">I</a> was wondering if you had the opportunity to do so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1659.941s">That</a> would be much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1661.461s">And</a> let me tell you the response I got from residents so far <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1665.232s">Many</a> residents are happy, and I'm sure Councilor Falco, who lives in the area can attest to it, are very happy with some of the progress that has been made to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1675.044s">I</a> just think we have to close the loop on some of the other major issues of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1682.092s">That</a> would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1683.987s">My</a> other question, Chief, over the last year, I know there's probably been an uptick, at least from the calls I've received in the community, but because of COVID, the fact that people are home now 24-7, I think you see a lot of particular things escalating that may not have happened during other times, but because of COVID, I think it's escalating some of this within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1712.928s">And</a> I get a fair amount of calls from residents that may have issues with a neighbor or someone a couple of doors down and don't know how to resolve an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1723.195s">And</a> for whatever reason, they can't get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1726.257s">And</a> I think it's important, Chief, and I'm not sure if this is currently being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1731.02s">I</a> know I mentioned it to you before, having some type of community mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1736.265s">where</a> the police can intervene on certain instances that may require them to get two parties together to somewhat come to a resolve, so it doesn't come to something other than a peaceful resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1752.152s">And</a> that would be my intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1754.353s">I</a> was just wondering, Chief, is there any type of community mediation program that exists? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1759.795s">If</a> not, is that something you'd be interested in moving forward in this community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1859.466s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1860.146s">I</a> think we're on the same page and I look forward to working with you to try to develop something in the community that we can use on a local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1869.988s">And</a> I appreciate the fact that, you know, there are certain items that we can't get involved in, but there are other items that I think we could successfully mediate, especially as the police department <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1882.032s">position</a> of authority can help assist, maybe ease some of the tension that may exist in certain areas and among certain neighbors and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1892.119s">So</a> I think that would be a useful tool to implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1895.441s">Chief,</a> I have a lot of other questions I'm gonna reserve to our budget meetings, and it's regarding personnel and your maintenance and regarding your vehicles and so forth, and I will reserve that <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1911.28s">to</a> when we meet for budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1913.341s">I</a> appreciate your time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3997.864s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3998.804s">I</a> want to thank my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli for co-sponsoring this as well as members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4006.682s">You</a> know, Councilor Scarpelli hit the nail on the head regarding the amount of work that is produced from your department, Commissioner Kerins. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4019.307s">It's</a> remarkable with the minimum manning that you have in all levels from parks, highways, cemetery, water and sewer that you're able to produce and keep producing is a tribute to not only the workers, but your leadership skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4037.115s">So</a> I just want to, on behalf of the residents of this community, thank you for all you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4042.037s">You</a> know, when you think of first responders, immediately police and fire are the thought, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4048.58s">DPW</a> workers, in my opinion, are first responders as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4053.122s">And</a> they've done a remarkable job over the past year during COVID to be out there and making sure that this community keeps moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4061.726s">And</a> indeed that has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4063.827s">You</a> know, this was extremely informative and that's why <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4066.484s">Myself</a> and council Scarpelli thought it'd be helpful to have these meetings every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4072.568s">I</a> never realized that DPW now does the maintenance of the police vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4078.332s">And</a> that's a large undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4080.294s">It</a> was always for the most part subcontracted out for much of the repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4086.418s">And</a> now I guess we're taking it in-house and that in itself is a large task and something that I didn't realize. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4095.204s">So</a> that was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4097.474s">I</a> would like to ask you, Commissioner, regarding equipment needs, and I know some of this will be touched upon in the budget, and I'm not gonna get into budget issues until we start talking about the budget, but is there anything in particular that you could say to the council and to the residents on what particular equipment needs you may have in the upcoming months?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4321.352s">Thank</a> you for that thorough response. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4322.992s">And</a> I know this council, and I'll just speak for myself, has been very supportive over the years to see that DPW received the appropriate equipment, the appropriate staffing to fit the needs of not only a department, but to make sure they address the needs throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4341.858s">And</a> I know that'll be <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4343.652s">something</a> that this council is pushing for during the budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4347.355s">Just</a> to touch upon what Councilor Scarpelli has brought up a dozen times, and I don't expect an answer now, but the creation of a sidewalk crew to do it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4359.844s">I</a> know Councilor Scarpelli has been on top of that for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4364.107s">And</a> I think from a financial standpoint, it makes a lot of sense to have an in-house crew that we can depend on <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4371.827s">that</a> sole purpose is to replace broken sidewalks throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4376.889s">So</a> I just want to put a plug in for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4379.73s">And</a> the priority sidewalk for snow removal, it's something that we've talked about recently over the last couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4388.252s">And</a> I'm hoping that's something that we can look at by doing 40, 50, 60 miles of priority sidewalk throughout the community to connect bus stops and schools <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4401.962s">business</a> districts for safe travel for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4405.844s">And</a> I know that's something that you expressed interest on as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4409.706s">And</a> the last point is what Council Vice President Knight brought up, I believe it was last week or the week before, regarding road improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4417.691s">And</a> I don't have to preach to you, Commissioner, but I think we all understand that our roads are in dire need of some attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4427.716s">And</a> it's great to throw some tire in a pothole, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4430.883s">but</a> I think many of the roads are past that and we have to look at resurfacing many of our major roads and thoroughfares throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4440.008s">And</a> I hope not only within the capital plan, but also our budget that we put a higher emphasis on roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4446.891s">So</a> I want to thank you again for coming tonight and appreciate all your staff and what you do for us on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4453.595s">Thank</a> you councilor, my pleasure.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5138.132s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5141.834s">You</a> couldn't meet a kinder, gentler person. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5144.636s">In</a> all the years I've been in city government, Marie really stands out for her way that she handles situations, her intense knowledge of what she does, and her really caring and sensitive approach, how she deals with children and family in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5166.63s">And</a> I just want to congratulate her, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5170.151s">I</a> do think there's a typo. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5171.391s">It</a> says five decades in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5176.412s">It</a> can't be five decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5180.972s">Murray's</a> not that old. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5182.793s">I</a> don't think it's five decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5185.173s">But</a> she does a tremendous job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5189.354s">And</a> on behalf of this council, I just want to thank her for all she does for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5194.935s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6175.164s">President.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6177.446s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6178.186s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on, and I want to thank Kelly Catalo for bringing up this very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6185.513s">Mr.</a> President, we did receive a response back from the email that was sent out by Kelly from the traffic engineer, stating more or less that these <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6197.223s">particular</a> sites are selected with due diligence and careful consideration for where they're being placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6204.665s">However,</a> if you look at the placement of these signs, I think that all goes out the window because I don't see that due diligence and careful placement of these signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6214.267s">I</a> see them plopped in front of front doors of people's homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6217.647s">The</a> thing is, Mr. President, with these signs, these are solar power signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6221.868s">So</a> we're not dependent upon having them in a certain area because of electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6226.659s">So</a> these signs can be moved anywhere along the stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6230.28s">Naturally,</a> you want to put them in an area that is conducive to slowing traffic down, making sure that people have the visual aspect to see the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6240.183s">So</a> there are other arrangements why signs are put in certain locations that the traffic engineer is best suited to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6247.945s">But</a> some of these, Mr. President, we're all very familiar with this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6252.042s">I'm</a> not sure why I couldn't go another 15 or 20 feet one way or another and not directly be in front of someone's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6258.409s">And</a> that's the one on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6260.251s">And</a> the one on Highland, I would say, even though it's very thickly settled over there, there's gotta be a better way of locating that sign rather than just putting it on the front door of someone's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6273.71s">So</a> I would ask to, I agree with Councilor Scapelli, and I would second that motion that this be sent to the traffic engineer for a second review of these locations, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6676.273s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6677.613s">Council</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6678.853s">If</a> I could, just because I know time is of the essence with these particular companies, that if we approve this contingent upon whether or not the council has the statutory authority <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6691.023s">to</a> approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6692.244s">And</a> if we do, then fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6693.844s">If</a> not, they'll have to revisit. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6696.265s">City</a> administration will have to revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6698.906s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7217.295s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7225.693s">I</a> just wanted to also, if the record can reflect if there's any liability waiver form signed as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7304.469s">Motion</a> of approval based on the contingency, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7310.335s">that</a> I raised earlier.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7312.135s">So</a> if we're the statutory authority of approval, if not, the administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7394.718s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7395.979s">And</a> I put this on the agenda tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7399.072s">This</a> has been close to a two-year process when we were first presented by Verizon applications to erect small cell towers within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7414.389s">I</a> put this on first to raise public awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7419.765s">Secondly,</a> to inform residents of the practice and the policy of the city of Medford regarding small cell placements and to address concerns that have been raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7434.337s">I'm</a> sure we all received them by residents of this community regarding the public health concerns from exposure to radio frequency, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7447.288s">And</a> I've read enough information <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7449.353s">on</a> both sides that I've come to the conclusion I still can't figure out whether or not it is a health concern based on everything I read. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7462.0s">But</a> I think there's enough information there that would raise a red flag, Mr. President, and residents that may be in close proximity to these particular 44 sites that is the first round of applications by Verizon <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7478.437s">should</a> be asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7480.418s">So</a> that's why I'm raising this tonight, Mr. President, not to take a stance one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7485.48s">So</a> the City of Method Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee will be having a hearing to consider Verizon's application for placement of a small cell telecommunication or 5G equipment on utility poles in the City of Method Wednesday, March 31st at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7502.145s">via</a> Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7503.406s">The</a> ID number, if people are interested, is 933 <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7509.269s">7697-5064.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7512.231s">So</a> if you're able to get on Zoom, that is the ID that you plug in. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7517.955s">And</a> the passcode is 035999. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7520.177s">There's</a> also a call in number if you don't have the ability to get on the internet, you can dial in at 929-205-6099. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7536.573s">And</a> according to the memo that was sent out by the administration, if you're unable to attend the meeting and would like to express your thoughts about the application or the application process, please email 5Gcomments at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7561.47s">And</a> they didn't put this, but I'm also gonna add, or if you don't have access, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7566.038s">please</a> call the mayor's office.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7573.288s">It</a> is the digit five, thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7576.252s">The</a> digit 5G comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7580.278s">And</a> you can also call the mayor's office to express your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7583.902s">It's</a> also important to know this advisory committee that was created by the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7590.868s">This</a> ad hoc committee consists of Alicia Hunt, the Director of Office of Community Development, Tim McGiven, the Director of Engineering, Paul Mulkey, the Building Commissioner, and Mary Ann O'Connor, Board of Health Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7604.898s">So</a> they are the four department heads that sit on this ad hoc advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7612.67s">The</a> interim policy was created by the previous administration based on the fact that the city did not have an ordinance to govern this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7621.973s">And</a> the Verizon applications were before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7625.894s">According</a> to the FCC, there are time restrictions that a community has to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7631.896s">And</a> I believe at the time, it was thought that an interim policy was the best approach until the city creates a full blown <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7641.313s">ordinance</a> that would govern the application process and the selection criteria and so forth of these 5G applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7651.938s">So</a> if I could, Mr. President, I would just ask that you indulge me for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7658.62s">There</a> were some, I went through the 44 applications that are on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7664.463s">I</a> have several questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7667.264s">The</a> meeting is a week from tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7670.363s">which</a> is the 31st, so residents that are interested really need to do their homework prior to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7677.068s">But</a> the application process, the applicant is responsible for obtaining the abutters list within 300 feet of each poll location within the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7687.556s">If</a> you recall in 2019, I think many of the councils were here, we put out five recommendations regarding the mayor's interim policy that was created. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7699.123s">One</a> of the recommendations was to expand the 300 feet notification to 500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7707.005s">That</a> was voted, I believe, unanimously by the council back in 2019, October 29th, 2019, but it never made it into the mayor's interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7718.928s">So</a> as way of an amendment, I would just like to ask that this administration <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7725.58s">add</a> that to the interim policy that we notify about us up to 500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7731.961s">I</a> think the additional notification will help ease concern in the neighborhood and concern of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7740.343s">We</a> also voted, Mr. President, this was unanimous by the council, that an amendment requesting that the policy of no public hearings take place before 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7752.305s">If</a> we all recall, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7754.19s">The</a> first original hearing was going to be held at two o'clock and there was outrage throughout the community for people working and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7762.393s">This</a> was a time when prior to COVID and many residents said that's outrageous that you'd have a public meeting at two o'clock during the day when a lot of residents couldn't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7773.948s">So</a> we asked that no meeting take place after six, no, before six. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7779.273s">This</a> meeting, I think, has called for six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7782.737s">However,</a> the policy still does not state that no meeting take place or hearing prior to 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7789.884s">And</a> I would ask that be the second resolution, once again, asking this administration to address that within the interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7799.171s">We</a> ask that copies of the plans be available on the city website for each petition, and I'm proud to say that is currently happening, and that was a request of this city council, and that is currently happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7814.519s">And</a> we also offer the request that the abutments be expanded to 500 feet, and that correspondence come from the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7825.774s">and</a> not the utility company. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7827.615s">The</a> original letter that went out was directly from the utility company. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7831.996s">And</a> if members recall, there was a lot of information missing on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7836.538s">The</a> exact location and other information, contact information was missing on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7843.741s">And</a> that Mr. President was never added to the policy as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7849.243s">And</a> I would ask that as a third amendment that this correspondence moving forward <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7855.729s">from</a> the city of Medford, which I hope that's the policy, but I think it is important enough to add into the interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7862.332s">And</a> the last one was offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7865.433s">He</a> offered an amendment requiring contact information for utility companies on all notices. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7873.576s">And</a> as we know, the first notice that went out, there was zero contact information just stating that they're going to have a <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7881.083s">a</a> small cell tower at a particular location, and that was never added to the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7887.708s">So</a> I would ask that that be added as an additional amendment that requires contact information for the utility on all notices that go out from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7902.219s">So</a> Mr. President, upon completion of the hearing, which is going to take place on the 31st, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7909.63s">The</a> ad hoc small cell committee may grant the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7915.132s">They</a> can grant it with conditions or deny the application based on inadequate capacity of the pole or mounting structure, safety concerns, reliability concerns, failure to meet... As well as the construction and placement of structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7937.525s">that</a> affect the installation of the primary use of the pole, residential concerns, and aesthetic considerations. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7946.111s">So</a> those are all the reasons that the small cell committee has to take into consideration, and I'm happy to see residential concerns are on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7958.899s">The</a> city of Medford is particularly sensitive to the visual impacts of small cell wireless infrastructures, therefore it shall implement and impose <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7967.578s">on</a> an interim basis, reasonable aesthetic standards pertaining to the size of the antenna, the equipment box, and or related cabling, placement of equipment on support structures, establishing flush mounting requirements and spacing requirements, and aesthetic measures such as paint matching or design matching for small wireless facilities in specific areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7993.944s">camouflage</a> and other concealment methods, and for residential areas, guidelines on structures, heights and lengths, and minimum setbacks, rules for dwellings, parks, playgrounds, or similar recreational areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8010.956s">So</a> I'm asking tonight, Mr. President, what are the minimum setback rules? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8016.42s">The</a> policy does not talk about minimum setback rules for dwellings, parks, playgrounds, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8023.586s">or</a> similar recreational areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8027.509s">And</a> I call that out, Mr. President, because part of the reporting that Verizon has to do, part of the reporting package, and it's voluminous, there's a lot of requests, is that when they select a location, there has to be criteria why they selected that pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8046.522s">There's</a> thousands of poles in the city, why did you select that pole? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8050.885s">And</a> the one I pulled up from George Street, like I said, there were 44 applicants on that for all different locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8058.495s">The</a> one I pulled up was the poll located at 50 George Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8062.187s">And</a> Verizon came out with this as their selection criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8065.908s">It</a> says it's superior to other locations, given that it is set in a heavily trafficked area for the purpose to increase the bandwidth and cellular quality of Verizon network devices in the vicinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8078.691s">The</a> location itself is set in the public right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8081.651s">This</a> location was not only chosen for its compliance <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8084.715s">with</a> Verizon Wireless and National Grid requirements, but respect to the municipality's desire for co-locations on existing structures, and it is not directly adjacent to a park, school, or playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8105.761s">I</a> might be mistaken, Mr. President, but our requirement says proximity to residential dwellings, school, parks, or playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8114.027s">So</a> they omitted residential dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8117.628s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8118.889s">Because</a> many of these 44 poles, these new towers, are all within 20, 30 yards of bedrooms, dining rooms, kitchens, front yards, play areas next to homes, porches. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8137.575s">So</a> I'm curious, Mr. President, I would offer this as an amendment <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8145.002s">Why</a> in the location selection criteria from Verizon, and I assume this is the case on all 44 applicants, but in particular for 50 George Street, why did they omit this as a chosen location and not include the proximity to residential dwellings? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8165.57s">So</a> that's another amendment I'd like to add, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8170.071s">And</a> that is missing from our criteria, which is in <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8175.636s">our</a> interim policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8178.397s">And</a> that's an important criteria, Mr. President, because as I'll state a little further down, there are reports out there, and I have several of them in front of me, Mr. President, that talk about the potential exposure and the risk for pregnant women, children, elderly, individuals that may have implants, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8202.814s">or</a> cardiac concerns, Mr. President, or neurological problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8208.198s">There</a> may be concerns, Mr. President, with exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8212.801s">And</a> the fact, Mr. President, that 5G, much of the information over the last 20 years, a robust body of independent science has emerged showing significant biological impacts from exposure to radio frequency microwave radiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8231.382s">including</a> clear evidence of cancer, neurological and cognitive harm, heart abnormalities, reproductive effects, and microwave sickness, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8243.79s">All</a> affecting the individuals that I spoke about. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8247.772s">And</a> human exposure guidelines for radio frequency microwave radiation used by the FCC are more than 20 years old and addressed only thermal, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8261.065s">not</a> biological impacts of exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8264.746s">So</a> that also, Mr. President, is another concern that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8270.008s">And</a> I raise this, Mr. President, on behalf of residents that may feel that their voice doesn't count, may feel that they don't have input on this and it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8282.531s">And</a> I wanna raise awareness, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8285.73s">where</a> many of these small cell towers will be located, like I said, within 20, 30, 40 yards of homes, bedrooms, porches, and where our families congregate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8300.26s">And</a> that's very concerning for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8304.903s">These</a> polls, Mr. President, they talk about cooling fans in residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8310.427s">The</a> small wireless facility operator permittee <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8314.232s">shall</a> use a passive cooling system. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8316.813s">In</a> the event that a fan is needed, the small cell wireless facility operator, permittee, shall use cooling fans with low noise profiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8328.919s">So</a> we all know what that means, low noise profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8332.781s">So</a> they're saying, don't worry about the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8335.582s">Whatever</a> we do is going to be permittable by whatever standards that are out there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8341.825s">But</a> I can guarantee you, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8343.499s">If</a> you lived within 20, 30 yards of this, and you had your window open in July and August and June, that these low noise profile cooling fans may not be as low as you think. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8357.83s">So</a> also, it's a concern of a public nuisance, Mr. President, or I should say a potential concern of public nuisance. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8370.06s">As</a> I allude to the description and the location of these polls say that the community perspective, including visual aspects and proximity to residential dwellings, schools and parks shall be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8386.073s">And</a> I hope when our four members get together, the department heads, that that truly is taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8394.019s">Another</a> aspect of this, Mr. President is <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8397.841s">The</a> petitioner is required to present a written plan indicating the protocol for turning off wireless facilities when utility workers are present on poles in order to limit their exposure to radio frequency emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8416.647s">The</a> plan should also include a description of any warning signs that will be posted to alert utility workers to radio frequency exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8426.498s">So</a> this safeguards any utility workers that are going to happen to stumble upon this poll to alert them, hey, we have high radio frequency exposure on this poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8439.649s">My</a> concern, Mr. President, I put this in the form of a motion, as you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8444.51s">The</a> city of Medford now owns many of the streetlights, if not all of them, throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8450.035s">There's</a> thousands of them, and there's reasons for our electrical department to be up. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8455.939s">I</a> know we subcontract the service, but there are reasons for our electrical department to be up around the radio frequency and get exposure, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8465.387s">And</a> what safeguards do we have, Mr. President, for our city employees for exposure? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8473.869s">So</a> that is in the form of a motion, Mr. President, to see what safeguards the city has on this, and not just what Verizon is doing for utility workers, but for our city workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8487.452s">And</a> then there should be a written plan indicating the response protocol to be implemented in the event that the equipment is damaged by weather-related event or due to an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8498.114s">So</a> I think it shows you the serious nature of this equipment <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8502.086s">and</a> the reason why there's protocol set up around it, Mr. President, which is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8508.908s">Then</a> it goes on the interim policy to talk about prohibitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8512.929s">And</a> it says no small cell wireless installation shall be installed on poles that do not meet sidewalk clearance requirements and standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8522.492s">This</a> includes horizontal and vertical clearances for pedestrian passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8527.754s">Applicable</a> requirements and standards may include but are not limited to <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8532.418s">ADA,</a> Americans with Disabilities Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8535.319s">So</a> my other motion, Mr. President, is that has this been reviewed by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8543.821s">So</a> prior to having a hearing, is the city going out to these sites and making sure that it follows the prohibitions that are set forth for clearance requirements <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8555.482s">according</a> to the city standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8558.143s">If</a> not, Mr. President, why are we wasting time notifying residents if this is not falling under the clearance standards that are already set forth by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8571.185s">We're</a> sending out notification, we're alarming residents, and then at the hearing, if they turn around and say, sorry, this doesn't meet the city clearance requirements for sidewalks, then we've wasted everyone's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8583.943s">And</a> I think we should do our due diligence prior to that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8590.768s">And</a> last but not least, and I appreciate my colleagues indulging me on this, but it is an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8599.295s">It's</a> been around two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8600.816s">Now</a> it's coming to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8602.358s">Verizon</a> put us on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8604.379s">They</a> threatened legal action against the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8608.342s">So</a> now we're on notice, and that's why the city is moving forward now. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8612.325s">But</a> the call that went out to the community was a good call. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8617.167s">It</a> notified residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8618.347s">I</a> am appreciative the administration did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8621.808s">I</a> assume letters going out to property owners within the 300 feet, we asked 500, but within the 300 feet about us we'll get more direct information. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8633.112s">But</a> Mr. President, I as one member of the council was eager to find out where these locations were. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8641.267s">and</a> the applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8642.808s">So</a> I went on the city website, and what popped up under the city website was a Google Map. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8650.314s">And</a> you know how difficult the Google Maps are, you got to take your fingers, and you pinch your finger and your thumb and you start expanding them. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8657.859s">And</a> these blue teardrops appeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8660.941s">And</a> if you expand too far, I was in Connecticut, and then I started going a little bit smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8667.406s">And</a> I ended up in, you know, Revere and <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8670.638s">It</a> was very difficult, to say the least, getting where these streets were. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8675.099s">So</a> I reached out to the city engineer, and he gave me a list of the streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8682.26s">That</a> should be on the city website, an actual listing of the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8686.721s">I</a> would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8690.242s">The</a> Google map is fine, but let's make it simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8693.882s">Let's</a> show residents what the streets are, where the polls are gonna be located, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8699.374s">and</a> it's easy access for someone to look up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8703.516s">It</a> is important where this is eight days away. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8706.718s">I</a> would just like to read the streets off. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8709.459s">It's</a> not that long, Mr. President, but for those that may not have internet access and can't figure out or maybe 301 feet from the site and not receive the correspondence from the city notifying of this important topic, I think this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8726.747s">So</a> the streets that, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8728.057s">were</a> pulled by the engineer and I thank him. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8730.818s">25</a> Dexter Street, the pole is located on Bow Street, where the installation's gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8739.101s">50</a> George Street, the pole is located on Wedgmere Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8743.322s">148</a> Washington Street, pole is located on Otis Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8747.063s">204</a> Winthrop Street, 13 Newburn Ave, 8 Alfred Street, 39 Albion Street, pole located on William Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8756.585s">287</a> Main Street, 25 Brooks Street, 72 Salem Street, all located on Oakland Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8762.833s">4</a> Central Ave, 499 Main Street, 20 Winchester Street, all located on Wareham Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8770.582s">200</a> Boston Ave, 21 Fairmount Street, 333 Main Street, all located on Bowdoin Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8777.319s">24</a> Wayham Street, 71 Central Ave, 4 Colby Street, 16 Mystic Ave, 42 Quincy Street, 600 Boston Ave, 13 Higgins Ave, 89 Princeton Street, 97 Greenleaf Ave, 13 Bradley Road, 62 Marion Street, 24 Tulsa Ave, 28 Killsett Road, 17 Court Street, 10 Winthrop Street, 87 Farmer Street, 236 Harvard Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8806.275s">90</a> North Street, 48 Granville Ave, 32 Brookings Street, 281 Boston Ave, 10 Cherry Street, 4 Brogan Road, 42 Martin Street, near 451 Boston Ave, 549 Main Street, 101 Chardon Ave, and 104 College Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8824.304s">I</a> appreciate my colleagues for letting me announce that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8827.385s">Mr.</a> President, from what I recall from a year and a half ago, Verizon had close to 90 applications at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8836.49s">They</a> went forward and they submitted 44. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8839.652s">I</a> still believe Verizon, this is only about half of what they're going to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8844.954s">And</a> if you look at the streets, you can almost tell it's about half the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8849.796s">It</a> doesn't include a lot of the other half of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8852.858s">So</a> I think we can anticipate another 45 locations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8857.333s">And</a> that's why it's so important that we get this process and this interim policy down pat to safeguard the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8866.955s">So</a> I want to thank my colleagues for indulging me. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8871.016s">I</a> know that was a long presentation, but I think it's important enough to make sure that this two year process, people don't feel left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8878.418s">People</a> feel like they have a say and people get involved on the march. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8882.563s">31st</a> hearing, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8935.313s">Excellent</a> job, just one correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8937.574s">And</a> I'm amazed with just one correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8939.535s">did</a> excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8940.696s">The</a> setback from dwellings in particular dwellings, because they did allude to parks, schools and playgrounds, but they did nothing about dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8949.26s">So</a> just if you couldn't, I appreciate you putting that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8952.121s">That</a> was very thorough.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9347.198s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9348.019s">I</a> want to thank Council President Caraviello, because indeed, this is important and very important for many of the seniors in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9358.746s">And</a> I know over the past year, we've been all preaching social distancing, social distancing, and it's very important <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9368.717s">that</a> our seniors be able to communicate and meet with their friends and meet with other seniors and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9379.061s">And</a> that aspect of their life, Mr. President, for the most part has been missing over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9384.604s">And</a> it's vital more than ever now that we start to bring some normality in a safe manner to our seniors, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9394.628s">And</a> one thing that I know has been <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9397.867s">that</a> resource is our senior center in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9401.788s">They</a> offer a number of worthy trips for our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9406.71s">Any</a> given time, you used to see the buses leave behind here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9411.132s">They'd</a> be jam-packed with seniors throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9414.573s">You'd</a> have the meat bingo that they'd have every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9419.655s">They'd</a> have a host of functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9422.696s">They</a> really did a lot for the seniors at that center. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9427.232s">And</a> I know a lot of seniors are sorely missing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9430.114s">So</a> I wanna thank Councilor Caraviello for recognizing that and whatever we can do as a community, if it's still a little too early, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9439.899s">But</a> I think that has to be in the back of our mind that the interaction for seniors is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9448.024s">And</a> in this time, I think it's important that we recognize that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9818.36s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9822.142s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9822.983s">I</a> too want to thank Councilor Bears for offering this <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9826.229s">I</a> think this council has been pretty vocal about having zero tolerance for any type of bigotry or hate crimes, Mr. President, not only in our community, but across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9841.959s">And</a> I'm proud of our record speaking up, Mr. President, against this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9847.182s">And</a> we know that this is a welcoming community, the city of Medford, and we will not tolerate any type of <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=9854.997s">hate</a> crimes or bigotry, Mr. President, we will stamp it out as a community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10241.395s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10243.836s">I</a> want to thank Council President Caraviello for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10249.979s">You</a> know, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, he was put at the front door for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10255.382s">And</a> I remember being up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10257.343s">He</a> was a very intimidating person. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10259.8s">And</a> you never gave him any back talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10262.461s">You</a> never looked at him out of the corner of your eye because you knew you were in for something if you could, if you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10270.544s">But</a> he was a great teacher and he really cared about the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10273.325s">And</a> I think that showed and my condolences go out to the family as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10521.75s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10522.571s">I</a> want to thank President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10524.693s">Every</a> year, he raises awareness for World Down Syndrome Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10531.238s">And</a> he does a magnificent job not just explaining what it is to have a family member with Down syndrome, but he also does a lot in the community, Mr. President, as someone that raises funds and raises awareness as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10548.692s">And</a> I appreciate the fact that you've been on top of this <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10551.412s">that</a> we've been able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10552.192s">I</a> think we've been consistent over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=10553.253s">Thank</a> you, and I really appreciate that.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=420.195s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=421.195s">Thank</a> you, Councilor and Vice President Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=425.17s">I</a> want to applaud Mr. Cote and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=427.433s">Lister</a> for all the work that they've done to make sure this is in the forefront of our state, making sure that motorcycle safety is something that's not falling from the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=440.907s">God,</a> I can remember Betsy riding her bike through Medford for <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=446.131s">a</a> long time now, and she was the first person that would hop off her bike and make sure that if people didn't follow the rules, make sure they got a lesson. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=456.377s">And</a> that's a scary lesson to learn, let me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=459.418s">So</a> I appreciate what you do do in keeping this going. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=463.2s">I</a> think that it can't be forgotten because like Councilor Morell said, I'm sorry, something personal happened to her life. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=470.564s">I</a> think that when you think about it, we've all had someone affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=475.834s">negatively</a> because of negligent driving with motorcycles and not taking their safety as a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=483.578s">So</a> I thank Councilor Knight again for bringing this forward and I appreciate your effort, all your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=488.961s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=489.421s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=490.061s">Councilor</a> Palacios.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=535.639s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=537.421s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=538.562s">And</a> I want to thank again, Vice President Knight for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=543.646s">You</a> know, every year we try to raise motorcycle awareness in this community through a number of initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=550.932s">This</a> is probably one of the most popular initiatives where we have the rally on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=556.356s">Hopefully</a> we can get back to that, Mr. President, when this COVID bypasses us <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=562.698s">However,</a> Mr. President, I think it's important that we make this aware because many people think the streets are owned by cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=572.325s">And</a> there are other vehicles, including motorcycles, bicycles, that are on the roadway as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=579.55s">And</a> I think drivers have to be mindful that they don't own the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=584.073s">They</a> share them with other vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=587.075s">And</a> it's important, Mr. President, that we spread that around. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=590.517s">It's</a> also important as a community <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=592.762s">that</a> we create safe spaces for motorcycles as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=598.626s">Many</a> communities have motorcycle parking spots, which I'm not aware of any in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=604.31s">And</a> these are the initiatives I think that will bring public awareness out there so people understand that there are other means of modes of transportation other than cars that are out there that are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=618.86s">And,</a> you know, in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=621.385s">You</a> know, I think motorcycle drivers get a bad rap. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=625.667s">You</a> know, when I see motorcycle drivers, they're always paying attention to the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=629.889s">They're</a> always using their singles. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=631.729s">They're</a> always driving accordingly to the rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=635.791s">And</a> I think it's only important, Mr. President, that we bring this awareness forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=643.754s">You</a> know, riding a motorcycle, you know, two gallons of gas, three gallons of gas, you can go 50, 70, 80 miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=651.257s">And,</a> you know, in this time of trying to conserve and so forth, I think it's a mode of transportation that we really need to get out there, Mr. President, and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=663.401s">So,</a> I want to thank my colleague for putting this on.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=700.89s">Mr.</a> President, if you'll indulge me, I'm a firm believer that the city clerk should be seen at these meetings, but not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=707.396s">But</a> I want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this resolution on and putting this proclamation on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=714.403s">Almost</a> 41 years ago, not too far from here, I lost my own father in a motorcycle accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=720.969s">And</a> it's something I think about every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=724.232s">It's</a> something that's seared in my brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=727.263s">And</a> there is no such thing as enough safety awareness around motorcycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=732.765s">And</a> so from the bottom of my heart, thank you for putting this on tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1122.104s">Councilor</a> Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1123.125s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1124.886s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1125.666s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1127.473s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1612.974s">Okay,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1614.776s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1615.436s">Appreciate</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1616.437s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1617.458s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1618.739s">I</a> just want to personally thank Director O'Connor for the update and I appreciate her appearing before the city council to not only notify this council, but also the viewing audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1631.21s">And</a> I find it very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1632.671s">Just</a> want to thank her.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1671.011s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1672.132s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1673.133s">Council</a> Members. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1674.274s">While</a> we're under suspension, last week myself and Councilor Scarpelli brought up paper 21-094, <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1682.566s">which</a> was a resolve requesting the police, fire and DPW department heads appear before the city council on March 16th to provide us department updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1693.714s">I</a> was just wondering if anyone of the chiefs or the DPW commissioner was on the call today.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1714.546s">So,</a> Mr. President, were the three duly notified by the city clerk?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1754.643s">Okay,</a> just for my own edification, what's the typical turnaround time then for once the council approves the resolution, voted on by the council on a Tuesday night, <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1767.197s">when</a> will that paper be received by the city administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1771.819s">They</a> typically go Friday morning or Monday morning, depending on when I finish the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1775.961s">Friday</a> or Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1777.682s">So</a> for a particular request like this, where it's time sensitive, is there any way we can get a quicker response? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1786.265s">I</a> mean, I know Jen in our office did talk to Daria and the mayor's office to let her know that that specific request was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1795.389s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1797.13s">So</a> are we being told that they're coming next week? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1799.652s">Is</a> that what it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1800.873s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1821.048s">I'm</a> talking about the budget before the city council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1827.3s">No,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1828.181s">This</a> was something different.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1829.722s">This</a> was something I saw Councilor Scarpelli put on just for an update from the three department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1835.187s">This</a> has nothing to do with budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1840.071s">So</a> we have, I believe the chief of staff on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1843.653s">He</a> is on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1844.734s">Are</a> they coming up next week? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1846.496s">Because</a> the paper was, I guess, received yesterday and that doesn't give ample time, which I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1854.122s">But</a> are they coming next week?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1866.296s">Okay,</a> I just would like you to know that I will be extremely displeased if they're not able to attend next week's meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1878.02s">So</a> I want to make sure- I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1879.881s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2013.68s">Mr.</a> President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2015.881s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2018.022s">The</a> request last week was to have three department heads appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2023.105s">The</a> council has every right to ask whether those that we invited are here, Mr. President, to discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2031.258s">what</a> we asked them to the previous week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2033.959s">This</a> is nothing new, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2086.399s">Right,</a> because that's the way we voted on it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2093.343s">This</a> was a date certain that we asked the parliaments to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2096.664s">We're</a> not asking every week, every other week, you know, this is a date certain.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2107.729s">They</a> would know if they were tuning in last week, which the request was last week, that they appear this week.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2146.691s">Again,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2148.592s">I,</a> too, I'm glad to hear that there's a legitimate reason why department heads on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2154.936s">And</a> I think that what's important is, again, it's not really the pre-budget discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2160.378s">It's</a> making sure that this council hears from our major department heads moving into the budget season, which is, it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2170.708s">I</a> hope the council president and city administration iron that out and get a schedule on what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2177.853s">I</a> personally thought we were pretty clear on what we were asking for in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2181.775s">I</a> think that, so I'm a little confused with that, but I think that it's important that we meet with these department heads and our department heads to make sure that as they step up to that, the pre-budget meetings and the budget meetings that we have all the information we need as a council <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2199.508s">to</a> make educated decisions on fiscal affairs of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2203.81s">Because</a> I think if you look at it, that's truly our number one priority, if I'm not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2210.554s">So</a> this is truly the most important thing we do now as our rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2216.518s">So</a> I think it's important that we get the assistance and the cooperation from everybody involved so we can make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2223.181s">So</a> we can make educated decisions when it comes to our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2228.536s">I</a> know that just maybe the chief of staff can dispel some rumors, but the rumor out there is I got a phone call today saying, we're getting $39 million, we're getting $50 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2241.224s">What</a> people don't really understand is what the true number is and how it's divided or where that can be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2247.668s">So,</a> they're already talking, just put it to a new fire station, put it to a new building, it's in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2254.152s">So</a> we just gotta make sure the community knows when these numbers come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2258.179s">that</a> if we can get, Mr. Clerk, if we can get just a report just so maybe from the city administration, just so that people can understand what these monies that the state is releasing right now, that it isn't free cash that we can plug in anytime we want for the next six months, because I think that's the rumor that needs to be dispelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2280.072s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2281.553s">Councilor</a> Morell.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2369.427s">Okay,</a> thank you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2372.36s">We're</a> just reviewing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2373.521s">This</a> is the actual, there's really, it looks like just a change of ownership, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2382.524s">And</a> the hours of operations, can you expound on that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2393.988s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2396.149s">Okay,</a> so it sounds like it stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2400.748s">I</a> see everything in order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2403.109s">I</a> move forward for approval on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2406.731s">I</a> know, unless my council colleagues have some questions.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4099.193s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4100.274s">I</a> do have a question and a request that they may provide us with an explanation on the reason for the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4109.176s">And</a> also, Mr. President, I'm under the opinion that the ordinance requires that the term of each of the three members that currently sit on the Board of Appeals expire every one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4125.758s">meaning</a> none of the members will be up all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4129.339s">And</a> currently, I believe we have a situation where all the members are currently expired. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4135.022s">So</a> I'm kind of concerned how that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4138.303s">And</a> secondly, Mr. President, it's important that <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4141.224s">We</a> have continuity on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4142.625s">It's</a> a very important board. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4144.066s">It's</a> a very technical board. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4145.727s">And</a> it's a very important board in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4149.249s">And</a> it's extremely important that we have always a consistent experience knowledge base on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4158.014s">And</a> that's the reason for the staggered terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4161.276s">So</a> I'm just wondering if the mayor can answer the reason for the change and why are all three appointments currently expired from my understanding.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4278.299s">So</a> if I could, Mr. President, just to follow up, and I appreciate the chief of staff's response. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4285.477s">So</a> Dave, based on the terms that are supposed to expire every year, is it the fact that there's been at least two of these positions that have been expired for the past two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4299.665s">And</a> if so, were they eligible to vote during the past two years?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4349.945s">And</a> did your office get any input from the public or local attorneys that currently use the board on this change?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4400.512s">And</a> the holdover that you refer to, are you saying that's part of a current ordinance?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4432.572s">All</a> right, so under that particular section, then there would never be a need to ever appoint anyone ever again.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4444.026s">It</a> seems that's what's been working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4446.448s">Yeah,</a> we are trying to understand that, but in theory, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4449.951s">That's</a> something we have to review, Mr. President, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4453.193s">And</a> I appreciate the response, and I would ask that that be put in the form of an amendment so we can get a response in writing.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4680.703s">Just</a> recently, we got a response back from Brian Kerins, the BPW Commissioner, at the request of the subcommittee to look at priority sidewalks throughout the city and create connectivity with the schools, with public transportation, <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4697.457s">with</a> bus shelters and access on sidewalks that would create roughly probably 30 to 40 to 50 miles of connectivity throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4709.88s">And</a> I was really surprised, and I think some of my colleagues were surprised as well, to hear the amount of money that this would cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4720.083s">And</a> it was very, very reasonable, Mr. President, to do this connectivity during any storm that's greater than <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4727.262s">three</a> inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4728.642s">And</a> I look forward to making a recommendation out of this subcommittee eventually that will work hand in hand with the new ordinance, as well as the connectivity that would open up access to walkways and crosswalks and really create a safe environment for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4749.347s">So</a> I think this is pretty exciting and I look forward to the next several meetings where we can make recommendations <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4756.442s">to</a> this council because eventually it's going to come to funding, but I don't think you can put a dollar amount on public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4763.204s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=5011.572s">Just</a> maybe moving forward when we go over these reviews, whether it's 30, 60, or 90, we should always put language in that states from the day of opening or the day of sign installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=5025.956s">So</a> that way we have an understanding that we're viewing this process that the whole intent of this is to make sure that these signs weren't glaring in residents' eyes at station landing and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=5039.431s">You</a> know, we just wanna make sure that we're doing the right thing.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=666.129s">Okay,</a> Council Member Bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=670.01s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=670.883s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=671.864s">I</a> want to thank Marianne for being on the call tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=674.765s">That</a> was extremely informative, and I appreciate the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=679.728s">Marianne,</a> last week we received as a council a correspondence from the mayor stating that the city was in the process of submitting an application to the state to become a vaccination site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=691.716s">I</a> was just wondering if you can update us with that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=816.049s">And</a> I'm sure you'll keep us posted if and when we do hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=819.311s">Oh,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=821.393s">Can</a> you give us an update on where we stand with the Method Public School faculty and teachers being vaccinated?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=891.308s">Right,</a> so the Department of Education just came out with a mandate that elementary school students will be going back beginning of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=900.475s">And</a> I'm just wondering where we stand with the vaccination for staff and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=907.547s">And</a> it sounds to me that it's up to the teachers to go off and try to get their own vaccinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=915.512s">And</a> yeah, I'm not sure why they're not listed as a priority, not just with the city, but on the state and the federal level, especially where the requirement is that in-school learning will take place at the beginning of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=930.361s">So</a> that kind of troubles me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=933.043s">One</a> other point, Mary Ann, and I'm not sure if you can answer it or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=937.567s">We</a> have roughly, according to my figures, about 4,500 seniors that are 75 years or older that currently reside in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=947.47s">Do</a> we have any indication what percent of those seniors have received either their first or second vaccination?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1035.204s">So</a> how difficult Marianne would it be for us, and I realize the state's not providing these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1041.367s">How</a> difficult would it be for us as a community to look at our most vulnerable, which are our seniors, especially seniors over 75. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1050.779s">to</a> reach out directly to them, if there's some 4,500, I'm sure that can be done, to see where they are in the process and to see who may need the additional help to gather an appointment, get on the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1064.582s">And</a> how difficult would that be? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1066.302s">Is</a> that something that we can accomplish?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1184.116s">I</a> don't think anyone behind this real doubts the work that's been done by the West Medford Community Center or the Council on Aging or your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1192.04s">I</a> would just hope maybe a little more emphasis goes on outreach rather than the community reaching out to you guys, you know, especially for our most vulnerable population. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1202.405s">And,</a> you know, we took a vote, Marianne, I just want to set the record straight a few weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1208.39s">And</a> I'm under the impression that maybe part of our vote wasn't accurately reflected in what this council voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1217.492s">But</a> we did vote unanimously to ask that you provide us with a weekly five minute update. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1224.974s">And</a> there may be weeks that you don't have an update and you just come on and say, I don't have an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1230.716s">But</a> I think would be very helpful, not just for this council, but the edification of the people that are watching <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1236.398s">that</a> get a lot of their information from tuning in over the many years, especially many seniors, that that would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1244.082s">So</a> I would just respectfully ask if you could set aside five minutes at the beginning of our meeting every week, just to give us an update, especially during this vaccination rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1254.728s">And</a> I wanna thank you and Council President Caraviello for establishing this chamber to be an open, once again, an open forum <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1264.97s">to</a> allow residents to come up and speak in a safe fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1268.933s">And</a> I think you both really put together a great working plan that involves CDC regulations, Board of Health regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1276.518s">And</a> I as one member, and I'm sure my colleagues can speak for themselves, are very appreciative to that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1281.561s">And</a> I wanna thank you both for your leadership on that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1303.053s">Well,</a> can I personally invite you the next?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2615.562s">Mr.</a> President, at this time, I would ask, because the council made a statement as well, I would ask that that statement be read as well, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2667.213s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2668.314s">And</a> I thought this was very fitting <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2670.756s">to</a> bring up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2673.217s">The</a> mayor, in her capacity, has the ability to put out proclamations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2677.718s">The</a> council has the ability to put out commendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2681.239s">And</a> Mr. President, this is truly a thank you to all those in the community that have participated over the past year in ensuring that we fight this horrible COVID-19 as one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2697.784s">And</a> I think what you saw over the past year is <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2700.415s">a</a> community unite over a common cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2703.637s">And</a> it involves many people in this community, as which we just heard the Board of Health and the many volunteers over the past year have worked tirelessly to make sure that our most vulnerable population served in a time of need, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2722.749s">And</a> that does not go unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2725.131s">So</a> on behalf of the council, I'm sure my council colleagues will speak <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2729.43s">I'd</a> like to personally thank Mary Ann and the Board of Health, as well as the volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2734.533s">I</a> also would like to take a moment, Mr. President, for someone that is in stop and shop at least two days a week and have seen the, what I call, frontline workers that have been there since day one, Mr. President, making sure that we have food, Mr. President, making sure that our stores remain open <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2756.617s">These</a> two also are the unsung heroes that we don't hear about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2762.478s">Meal</a> carriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2764.298s">They</a> haven't missed a beat, Mr. President, in the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2767.739s">Healthcare</a> workers who have been dealing with the sick and infirm, Mr. President, during these tough, difficult times. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2775.8s">First</a> responders, police, fire, and EMS within our community have done yeoman's work, Mr. President, in answering the calls over the past year <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2785.988s">and</a> have not received much praise, Mr. President, but I think this council accommodation is thanking them after a year of their due diligence, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2798.299s">School</a> employees, teachers that have been on the front lines, Mr. President, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2804.204s">I</a> mentioned grocery workers, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2806.043s">bankers,</a> Mr. President, retail employees, truckers, delivery people that have been delivering in our neighborhoods into the most needy, into shut-ins in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2817.268s">Military</a> personnel, Mr. President, that have been there to protect us during this awful virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2823.49s">Sanitary</a> workers, restaurant workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2825.851s">We</a> have a gentleman here tonight, Mr. President, that owns a restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2829.855s">And</a> many of these restaurant workers during this tough time were there to make sure that they stayed open, even though business was tough and, you know, you weren't allowed to have people in your restaurant. <a

href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2850.158s">You</a> know, that doesn't go unnoticed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2853.339s">We</a> have nonprofit workers that have been out in the streets assisting families, homeless families, people that are being discarded, Mr. President, tenants and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2866.022s">That</a> has been a huge issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2868.683s">The</a> building and trades, they haven't gone down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2872.384s">They're</a> up and functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2873.764s">Civil</a> service employees, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2876.978s">And</a> every other Method resident that reached out to their neighbor or a loved one and asked them if they needed help, if they needed assistance, do they need someone to shovel? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2886.644s">Do</a> they need someone to go to the store and pick up their laundry? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2890.487s">Or</a> do they need someone to help get some food? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2893.149s">And</a> these are the unsung heroes, Mr. President, in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2897.491s">And</a> on behalf of the council, I'm sure my council colleagues are gonna speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2902.194s">We</a> wanna thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2903.708s">on</a> behalf of the mayor's proclamation, and also the council's accommodation, thanking everyone in our community for pitching in during this very difficult time.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3389.547s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3390.367s">Mr.</a> President, while we're under suspension, I would ask that we take public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3395.769s">We</a> have a distinguished gentleman in the audience that served almost four decades in the public service here in the community that would like to speak.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3408.452s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4104.487s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4117.452s">Mr.</a> President, Councilor Baxton. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4120.373s">I</a> wanna thank my former council colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4124.054s">I</a> know he's very passionate on this and this is not the first time Councilor Penta spoke on this issue and he does raise some valid concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4133.662s">I</a> offered the resolution back some several weeks ago and read thoroughly the response we got from Aleesha Nunley, our finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4143.607s">And</a> I also received the correspondence via email from the Water and Sewer Commission to the chair, Dominic Camara, who in my opinion, along with the rest of the board, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4156.018s">is</a> doing a great job in a very difficult, as you can imagine, board to operate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4164.062s">And,</a> you know, the response that we received from the administration, we did ask this council ask directly, if we're able to see the base rate, what that actually pays for within the water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4178.208s">And</a> they were unable to break out that particular portion compared to just the regular rates <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4184.784s">and</a> say, well, with the base rate, we paid for X, Y, and Z. And that's how they do their accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4190.966s">And</a> personally, I don't see a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4193.927s">What</a> Councilor Penter is asking for is more of an itemized type listing of where the expenditures are going based on what <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4202.462s">revenues</a> coming in, and I'm not sure if they have the capability or capacity to report it out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4209.466s">But</a> that, as Councilor Knight mentioned, that's not really end of our purview anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4215.289s">When</a> this originally came out on the council, there was some concern because members of the council, including myself, thought this was a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4225.214s">And</a> it raised a lot of eyebrows because at the time we said, wait a minute, we usually have a surplus in the water and sewer accounts, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4232.01s">of</a> several million dollars, why would we need now all of a sudden start charging residents a connectivity fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4239.379s">We're</a> already connected to the water and sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4243.103s">But</a> come to find out it wasn't really a connectivity fee, it was a base rate fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4248.51s">And</a> there is a difference, a substantial difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4251.573s">And</a> as Councilor Penta alluded to, the base fee is a stabilizer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4256.818s">So</a> the way it was told to me and the way I understand it is that every period, the billing period, we're not sure what we're going to receive for revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4267.019s">We</a> know how much the MWRE is going to charge us because we have everything needed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4272.34s">City</a> Hall gets constant updates through the little antenna on your water meter telling how much the water usage is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4279.382s">So</a> City Hall at any given minute could say how much the water consumption is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4284.123s">We</a> have giant meters throughout the community that show the inflow and outflow of sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4291.585s">And</a> we can tell you how much sewage is leaving this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4295.166s">So</a> they have a good handle on <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4297.565s">what</a> the fixed charges are in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4301.667s">The</a> handle we don't have is how much revenue are we gonna bring in? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4306.949s">Because</a> there may be, especially during these fiscal difficult times during COVID, that someone may not be able to pay their water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4315.952s">And</a> it happens not just during COVID, other times. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4319.774s">And</a> so having, the way I understand it, a base rate set up <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4324.553s">It</a> sets up a revenue stabilizer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4326.754s">So</a> we know there's a million dollars guarantee that's coming from the rate payers that's gonna pay off what we owe. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4334.941s">So</a> it's not an extra charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4337.043s">It</a> is definitely not an extra charge in the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4339.685s">It</a> goes towards paying off your rate, the water and sewer rate for the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4345.37s">And</a> it's somewhat provides a stabilizer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4348.272s">One</a> would ask, why don't we raise it? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4350.581s">because</a> the million dollars is not much of a stabilizer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4353.224s">Why</a> don't we raise that base fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4355.005s">And</a> then we can have guaranteed money in there and know where the money's coming from and serve the same purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4363.213s">So</a> I think I understand where you're coming from councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4366.877s">I'm</a> not quite sure the city has the capability of providing that level of detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4371.908s">that</a> you're looking for regarding what projects were done in the city, what infrastructure did this money go towards? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4378.653s">Leak</a> detection. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4379.314s">You've</a> been talking about leak detection for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4382.316s">We</a> have a high percentage of water that's leaking out throughout the system, and it's costing the rate payers millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4388.881s">The</a> council has probably heard me a million times about inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4392.984s">The</a> sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4394.305s">We</a> accept groundwater that's going into the sewer system, and that groundwater is going out to Deer Island and being treated as raw sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4401.487s">costing</a> us millions of dollars a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4404.189s">And</a> we're aware of it, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4406.23s">We</a> have an aging infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4408.512s">You</a> know, so this is a much larger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4411.174s">I</a> wanna thank the council for keeping it in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4413.916s">You</a> know, our water meters, like the new schools that we talk about that were put in 17 years ago, our water meters are now, the new water meters are 15 to 17 years old, and the life expectancy was roughly 13 to 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4429.207s">And</a> it's just a matter of time <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4430.822s">that</a> we experienced when I first got on the council, that half of our meters were being estimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4438.024s">That's</a> when the city steps in and says, you know, Mr. Panto, we don't know how much you're using for water, but we're gonna estimate your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4444.865s">How</a> would you like your bill to be estimated and not actual? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4448.326s">So</a> they could be charging you double what you're actually using. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4451.447s">And</a> that's why we put the emphasis on these new meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4454.187s">And</a> now we're coming up to a period of time where <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4457.059s">You</a> know, we have to look at these meters and it's a multi-million dollar project, but it's very important that people get charged exactly what they're using, Mr. President, very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4467.508s">And</a> I'll always support that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4470.01s">And</a> the days of estimating are over in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4474.334s">So</a> I appreciate the council bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4477.317s">I</a> always look forward to hearing Councilor Penter and he does his homework and research and I thank you for bringing it up again.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4553.426s">Just</a> a point of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4556.788s">Just</a> a point of information, this council, and I believe you were part of it back some years ago, we've voted year after year after year to use retained earnings to offset the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4566.191s">And</a> the rates over the last couple of years were going to go up double digits. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4569.582s">And</a> if it wasn't for this council and previous council stepping up and offsetting it with the, which is rate payers money, but offsetting with that money that you're talking about in retained earnings, the rates would have gone up even higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4583.169s">So</a> I just want to set the record straight on that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5005.909s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5008.11s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5009.271s">And</a> I would ask my colleagues to wait to tell Brian how much work this is until we take our vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5017.077s">But</a> no, you know, anyone in the community that's been around the community knows the amount of time Brian puts in at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5024.633s">how</a> he volunteers endlessly across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5028.174s">His</a> organizational skills are impeccable. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5030.975s">Look</a> at the offerings and how far the West Medford Community Center has come over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5035.917s">And,</a> you know, Brian won't toot his own horn and I know there's a lot of good people there, but Brian is largely due in part to what he's done for that West Medford Community Center over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5048.722s">As</a> you can see, he's a level-headed person, which is needed on boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5053.02s">He's</a> a man of reason and a person of understanding, and I think he would be a great fit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5059.566s">We</a> don't have many appointments as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5061.828s">You</a> can count them on one hand, how many appointments we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5065.411s">So</a> this is important to us as a council, and it's important we pick the right person. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5070.255s">And</a> without a doubt, Brian is going to do some remarkable things down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5074.299s">We</a> have a beautiful stadium, Mr. President, we can all be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5078.593s">And</a> I know Brian will continue to make that a showplace for our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5219.753s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5222.314s">I'd</a> be remiss if I didn't mention the outgoing Commissioner Lenny Gliona, who has done a tremendous job representing not only the Hormel Commission, but this Medford City Council who appointed him back <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5235.911s">some</a> several years ago that have made great strides at Hormel, largely in part of Lenny's input and his diligence to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5245.198s">So</a> I wanted to personally thank him.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5616.214s">I</a> want to thank Vice President Knight for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5622.178s">I</a> think behind this rail, we've all spoken about sidewalks and roads ad nauseum. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5628.461s">And</a> I think this is a great proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5633.124s">However,</a> Mr. President, with that being said, we as a council have not had the opportunity to sit down as a council and go over the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5643.429s">And</a> I would respectfully ask my colleague to hold off on this until we have the ability as a council to sit down <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5650.718s">and</a> go through what we believe are some of the issues that we would like to see addressed within the capital plan and not do it piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5659.424s">And</a> I would just respectfully ask my council colleague to either withdraw this or set up a meeting where we can sit down and have a meaningful dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5670.971s">It's</a> $107 million proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5673.453s">And</a> I also had the opportunity to watch it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5677.255s">And</a> there are a lot of unanswered questions <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5680.277s">from</a> the school appropriation to when the fire department will eventually see their buildings be refurbished and why are we waiting so long to refurbish? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5690.605s">the</a> fire headquarters, as well as the other existing buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5695.787s">I</a> think there's a lot that needs to go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5698.548s">And</a> I don't want to send a message that if we do support this, that this is what the council is looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5705.111s">And</a> that's it, Mr. President, because that's furthest from I as one member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5710.773s">So</a> I hope my council colleague can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5714.315s">And</a> maybe we can use this as a catalyst to take a look at the capital plan <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5719.538s">and</a> see what the needs are as a council and as a community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5831.807s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5834.791s">As</a> I stated, I don't think anyone's been a bigger advocate of roads over my term on the council in discussing the needs and the fact that we don't put any money in the budget for roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5846.384s">From</a> what I've been told by the mayor, and the mayor can correct me if I'm wrong, she told me this was a draft capital plan.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_qSI3HeMHz3A/2024-11-19_qSI3HeMHz3A.html">City Council 03-02-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1026.242s">If</a> I can, I- Just point of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1029.044s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1031.145s">I</a> appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's intent, <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1035.218s">You</a> yourself, Mr. President, just stated to us that you tried on several attempts to have a meeting with the administration to discuss the budget, and they refused to get back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1049.963s">I'm</a> not quite sure what I'm gonna be able to do on a subcommittee trying to pose the same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1055.905s">So</a> I appreciate the intent, but I'm not sure how effective that'll be.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1697.3s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1700.001s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1700.701s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1702.581s">Uh,</a> Mr. Walls really cared about the students he taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1707.122s">Uh,</a> he was strict, but, uh, he cared and that showed Mr. President and the way he carried himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1713.175s">and</a> his community involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1715.376s">He</a> was involved in a lot of different activities, as you heard from my council colleagues, and he was never looking for a thank you or anything other than he just wanted to give back, and indeed he did so. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1727.399s">He</a> was a true family man, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2686.294s">I'm</a> sorry, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2687.655s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2689.637s">I</a> just want to make it be known, Mr. President, that a lion's share of the Peg Access money does not go directly to Peg Access. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2698.324s">It</a> actually goes into the city coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2700.648s">So</a> 3% of the money that would be generated by this automatically goes into city coffers and 2% goes into peg access. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2709.074s">And</a> that's something I think we have to look at as a council regarding a home rule petition that was filed some 30 years ago by this Medford City Council, Mr. President, and put the money where rightfully belongs, which is community access, which is government, public and educational channels, Mr. President, in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2729.417s">Thank</a> you, council member. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2730.037s">It's</a> on the motion by Councilor Morell and Councilor Leik.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2836.664s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2838.605s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2840.206s">Councilor</a> Lai brings up a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2841.707s">If</a> it hasn't been signed to a committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2844.305s">Where</a> is the clerk going to forward this to? <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2847.627s">One</a> part of the resolution does say to the House Speaker and the Senate President, but if it's not assigned to a committee, where does it go?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2881.788s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2882.768s">So</a> we send it to our state delegation?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3376.993s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3378.314s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3379.214s">I</a> just wanna thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3383.615s">This</a> is a very timely resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3387.136s">We're</a> gonna be faced with probably one of the most difficult budgets over the last many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3394.475s">And</a> I think it's important, Mr. President, that we allow people in this community to voice their concerns, whatever form they decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3406.963s">And</a> coming in public is one, Mr. President, way of doing such. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3413.086s">And</a> I don't want to limit someone's ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3415.628s">If</a> they feel safe, Mr. President, and if the protocols are followed, that they have the ability to come up and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3424.268s">as</a> well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3426.369s">I</a> find it very difficult that you can open restaurants now and you could be seated six feet from someone and be eating a meal, but you can't speak without a mask on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3441.098s">It's</a> very difficult to eat without a mask on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3443.82s">So</a> I'm not quite sure the mixed messages that are being sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3448.522s">All</a> I can tell you is that since we've been on this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3453.278s">and</a> open this council up for business that we've run this meeting, Mr. President, adhering to all the CDC guidelines and the Method Board of Health guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3464.527s">And</a> I think we've done such in a safe manner and I am very proud of what we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3470.872s">So</a> we do have the ability to accommodate and that is not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3476.177s">So</a> I guess as long as we have that ability, Mr. President, we can open up and start doing business <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3483.238s">as</a> usual in a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3485.019s">And</a> I wanna thank my colleague for bringing this up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3489.54s">Mr.</a> Castagnetti, I think you had your hand up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3794.27s">Mr.</a> President, I move to take papers 19660, paper 20295 and paper 20519. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3796.652s">Slow</a> down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3798.294s">What's</a> the first one? <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3799.595s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3799.875s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3800.015s">And</a> if you could also add on to it,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3850.022s">Mr.</a> President, do we have anyone that would like to speak on this where it is a third reading?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3901.733s">Do</a> we have anyone Mr. President from the public?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4532.465s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4533.246s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4536.087s">And</a> indeed, Vice President Knight is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4539.909s">My</a> first paper in my folder, Mr. President, this dates back first presentation to the mayor, November 13, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4552.386s">This</a> is when this project was presented by Eversource to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4558.431s">So</a> some six years ago, Mr. President, almost seven years we're working on now with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4563.855s">I</a> also have a copy of the MOU, a memorandum of understanding from Mark Rumley dated March 9th, 2017, which lays out many of the mitigating <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4578.794s">items,</a> Mr. President, as part of the agreement between Eversource and the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4586.26s">And</a> I also have, Mr. President, a number of Committee of the Whole meetings from 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4594.367s">I</a> believe you may have been president at the time that we held regarding Eversource, regarding neighborhood concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4602.768s">I</a> think it was Council Scarpelli that requested that they have direct neighborhood meetings in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4610.854s">And</a> a lot was done by this Medford City Council to ensure that this project, when it did take place, that first of all, the city of Medford received some benefits because this line that they're installing, this high tension line, has zero benefits for the city of Medford other than total disruption <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4632.234s">of</a> our streets, Mr. President, and noise in our neighborhoods as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4639.77s">I</a> believe we put a number of initiatives in place to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4644.693s">The</a> calls that we got and emails from area residents, I know the Karen family that lives on Winthrop Street, very involved in the community over a number of years, they had a concern, rightfully so, of putting back the street, pave to pave, and also the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4663.547s">And</a> I did find a press release <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4666.149s">from</a> April 17th, 2019 from then Mayor Burke, and it states, and this is a quote from the mayor, that Eversource Project to connect their Woburn and Everett substations with an underground conduit will improve New England's power grid, which benefits the entire region by meeting its electricity needs in a more reliable manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4691.599s">Method</a> residents will benefit directly <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4694.187s">from</a> just over three miles of street restorations and improvements along the route. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4700.549s">Improvements</a> to sidewalks with ADA compliance and curbing near Lorraine and Smith Roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4707.532s">Installation</a> of freeways crosswalks on Winthrop Street at Method High School, Winthrop Street crosswalk by Memorial Park and South and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4718.115s">And</a> other smaller improvements along the route. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4720.476s">And</a> that was said by former Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4723.42s">So</a> there is plenty of record, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4726.001s">I</a> know some residents are concerned, and rightfully so, it's been such a long process that if you don't have a file to look back, you forget the commitments that were made, and we wanna make sure that these commitments aren't forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4738.807s">So</a> as far as I'm concerned, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, the curbing of the sidewalk on both sides, Lorraine, Smith, and all the way down Winthrop Street, Mr. President, was a commitment that was made originally back some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4753.441s">And</a> that will be honored, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4756.782s">Regarding</a> the construction itself, they seem to be making a lot of progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4762.644s">I</a> haven't received a lot of complaints regarding neighbors not being able to access their driveways, regarding excessive noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4770.427s">I</a> think Vice President Knight mentioned about the storage of equipment during work time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4778.029s">I</a> haven't seen any equipment stored <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4780.07s">in</a> the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4780.73s">So</a> I think we really stood our due diligence on our homework when this project was coming through three miles of our roads and our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4790.354s">And</a> that has nothing even to do with traffic and the impact of traffic, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4796.075s">And</a> I just want to thank my colleagues and we have to make sure we stay on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4800.497s">So</a> I will support the motion offered by my colleagues for an update from Eversource.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5069.25s">Do</a> we have Chief Gilberti on the... Yes, I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5079.799s">Chief,</a> could you just give us an update on this paper?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5094.787s">Why</a> don't you, while we have you, why don't you give us an update on the trucks?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5179.653s">And</a> what about the other lot of truck, Chief?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5198.162s">So</a> we're looking at one, possibly the middle of April and the other one, we're not sure yet.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5216.37s">So</a> they come fully equipped or will there be a process to equip the trucks when they get here?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5239.094s">And</a> what stations will these be at?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5251.038s">Okay,</a> and do we have Aleesha Nunley on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5261.025s">Alicia,</a> can you give us an update on this paper?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5317.398s">Okay,</a> so at the end, so after 10 years, what are we paying in interest on these?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5429.75s">So</a> the 2.6 million covers equipping the trucks as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5436.795s">And</a> chief, if you can just give us a brief rundown of <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5440.729s">What's</a> going to be done with the existing ladder trucks? <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5443.931s">Are</a> they going to go into reserve? <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5445.272s">How</a> is that going to work?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5501.756s">And</a> where are the plans to keep the trucks that are in reserve?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5509.78s">We</a> have room to keep them indoors?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5542.038s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5543.018s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5544.76s">Any</a> other questions for my colleagues? <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5548.382s">Any</a> questions from the public?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5560.462s">On</a> the motion of approval by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5565.926s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5591.831s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5593.211s">Five</a> in the affirmative, two recusals. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5596.252s">The</a> motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5599.493s">Thank</a> you, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5601.254s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5603.554s">Chief,</a> you look excellent, Chief, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5606.315s">Say</a> again? <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5607.635s">You</a> look excellent.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_CEBUcuE3cuo/2024-11-19_CEBUcuE3cuo.html">City Council 02-23-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=228.361s">Would</a> I get a promotion? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=229.182s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=229.702s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=230.883s">What</a> does it pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=232.044s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=234.066s">Mr.</a> President, two weeks ago, this council voted unanimously to ask that we receive a weekly update from the Board of Health Director regarding phase one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=243.693s">and</a> phase two rollouts of the state and city vaccination. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=247.874s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=248.895s">Mr.</a> President, I would ask that every week prior to the motions, orders, and resolutions that we receive the update from the Director of the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=261.018s">And</a> I was wondering if she's on the call tonight, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=285.355s">Okay,</a> do we have anyone from the city administration on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=299.75s">So</a> Mr. President, it was, I believe it was several months back, the council requested a monthly update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=308.237s">And</a> now with the vaccination rollout and the importance of getting our seniors and first responders vaccinated, <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=318.444s">that</a> we requested that we receive weekly updates, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=322.127s">I</a> don't think that's a lot to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=324.329s">As</a> we all know, this is an evolving subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=328.432s">Every</a> day it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=329.874s">New</a> information comes out every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=331.715s">We</a> heard today that potentially schools will be back sometime in April for the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=337.6s">on</a> a full-time basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=339.062s">So</a> this is something very important, Mr. President, that we receive updates as well as the general public be informed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=347.132s">And</a> this is one avenue to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=349.034s">I'm</a> not saying that this is the only avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=351.697s">It's</a> one avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=352.878s">I</a> am extremely disappointed <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=355.462s">that</a> there is no one on from the Board of Health to give this council and give the residents of the community update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=363.092s">Mr.</a> President, I still am receiving calls from seniors that are looking to get into the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=371.202s">are</a> waiting for the city of Medford to open their site, which we heard now is probably not going to happen because they're going to more of a group effort with Melrose and Malden, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=386.732s">But</a> there are many seniors, I believe we got statistics, there are over 4,500 seniors that are over 75 that would be eligible for the injection, Mr. President, that live in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=400.38s">And</a> it's important that we know, Mr. President, the outreach that's happening in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=405.845s">Are</a> seniors being contacted? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=407.746s">Are</a> there a list? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=409.648s">Is</a> there a current list that the city of Medford is working off of? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=415.172s">What</a> type of outreach? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=416.413s">Are</a> they reaching out to seniors? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=417.955s">We</a> can identify, we don't have to get into medical issues, Mr. President, but we can identify the population that's eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=426.742s">Now</a> it's open for residents 65 to 74 that may have some other associated health risk also, Mr. President, and how many thousands more Method residents are eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=438.825s">I</a> keep on getting phone calls from residents saying they can't make it to these other large state sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=444.526s">They</a> just don't have the bandwidth to get out to these sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=448.287s">And</a> we're asking our most vulnerable population to go out to these mega sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=452.911s">They</a> don't have the ability to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=454.672s">They</a> don't have the ability to stand in maybe hour long lines, which I had witnessed myself, Mr. President, over at Fenway Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=463.559s">Our</a> long line, Mr. President, I think that's asking a lot of our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=469.121s">And</a> all we're asking for is a weekly update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=472.142s">So</a> I would hope, Mr. President, if they're not on the call tonight, if they don't jump on tonight, that next Tuesday that we take up this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=480.004s">before</a> motions, orders, and resolutions are called, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=493.455s">I</a> want someone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=494.876s">We</a> voted to have an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=495.937s">I</a> will make sure that someone is here next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=497.598s">Someone</a> physically here to speak to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=499.479s">I</a> don't think we're asking a lot of one of our department heads during a pandemic to give us an update, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=507.085s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1564.964s">Just</a> briefly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1565.945s">I'm</a> sorry, Councilor Marksley. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1567.586s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1568.286s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli and the comments of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1573.517s">I</a> fully agree with teachers should be listed as essential workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1581.562s">They</a> are essential workers when they're dealing in teaching our kids and by no stretch of the imagination, so they could be considered otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1590.928s">It</a> was stated by the governor just recently that the inability for them to have the visibility of how many injections they're gonna get in from the state <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1603.357s">on</a> a weekly basis is the inhibitor right now with rolling this out to teachers and to other people that may be in need of the injection. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1614.021s">And</a> the governor was requesting that the federal government give at least a three or four week window on what we're gonna get for vaccinations, the number of vaccinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1625.946s">And</a> that'll enable us at our sites, our mass vaccination sites, <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1630.112s">to</a> roll this out more effectively and efficiently and be able to have people book one, two, three, four weeks out at a time, which is currently not happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1639.894s">So</a> some of its logistics, Mr. President, and I would ask as part of this that we also send a correspondence to our federal delegation asking that they at least give some more visibility and insight on the number of injections we're gonna get as a state <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1658.65s">So</a> when we roll out our plan, that we're able to plan for it and book residents and teachers in advance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1666.718s">I</a> would also ask that the school committee show leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1673.064s">And</a> once again, Mr. President, meet in a public setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1677.146s">You</a> know, we're going to be asking teachers, we're going to be asking students to get back into the classroom, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1683.59s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate that the school committee lead by example, Mr. President, and have their meetings held in a public setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1691.115s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1722.494s">The</a> number of vaccinations in advance.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2768.948s">Councilor</a> Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2770.309s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2771.009s">I</a> want to thank my two colleagues, Councilor Falco and Councilor President Gaviello for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2777.493s">As</a> I've stated in the past, we put very little to almost no money to resurface our roads and the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2786.758s">So</a> we rely heavily on chapter 90 money, which is about 980,000 a year we receive from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2793.962s">And</a> when you have over 700, 800 streets in a community, you can imagine a 980,000 doesn't go too far in having a plan to resurface our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2809.772s">Councilor</a> Knight offered something back, I think it was two years ago, maybe two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2816.846s">regarding</a> having our streets inspected through this machine that would go and almost do like an x-ray of the roads, up and down the roads, and be able to give you a printout on what streets are in dire need to be repaired and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2833.311s">And</a> it sounded like a magnificent idea to at least understand 700 or 800 roads, what the condition is, how they're evaluated, and what priority they're put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2844.487s">Because</a> right now, I think it's just a matter of, you know, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2849.97s">And</a> I can tell you firsthand, I've lived on the street almost 30 years that hasn't been touched in 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2857.314s">So</a> I think looking at some of these innovative and creative ways of potentially, as you mentioned, Mr. President, having our dollar spread a little further and doing more roads per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2870.08s">And</a> as Councilor Knight mentioned a while back by <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2873.772s">evaluating</a> our streets to see where the priority roads are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2878.015s">I</a> think that goes a long way in having an approach, a systematic approach to addressing what our needs are in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2885.841s">And</a> so I support this paper wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2889.744s">I'd</a> like to see even if we can roll it out to sidewalks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2893.486s">I</a> know this substance could probably be used on sidewalks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2897.949s">And</a> if that's the case, it may be a cost effective way <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2902.331s">handling</a> some of the trip and falls that end up being lawsuits in a quicker and much more reasonable fashion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4251.77s">I'll</a> have the motion by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4254.192s">So</a> Councilor Marks, do you want to say something? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4256.594s">I</a> do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4258.155s">Several</a> weeks back, we had the Board of Health Director before us, and I believe it was Councilor Scarpelli asked the Board of Health Director when we could start having the general public into the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4270.264s">And</a> the Board of Health Director stated that as long as there's social distancing and all the CDC rules and regulations <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4278.052s">or</a> adhere to, we're fine to have members of the general public come up to our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4283.696s">Since</a> then, we've had at least two that I can recall, maybe three people come before the council in person to publicly state their opinions on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4294.703s">And</a> Mr. President, I am dumbfounded why the building is still on lockdown while we have our meeting at seven o'clock here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4304.85s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President respectfully <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4307.381s">that</a> these doors remain open during this council meeting, whereas we were given the green light by the Board of Health Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4315.783s">Of</a> course, unless things have changed and we weren't notified, but then again, we wouldn't know that because the Board of Health Director hasn't appeared before this council at our request. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4327.286s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President that these doors remain open for public input during the council meeting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=4336.765s">And</a> as I mentioned, as long as social distancing and all the CDC requirements are adhered to.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3v7haMF7rG4/2024-11-19_3v7haMF7rG4.html">City Council 02-16-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1939.438s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1940.298s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1943.958s">Indeed,</a> there are a number of these drop boxes throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1948.499s">The</a> Fells Plaza over the last many years has been an issue of concern to many area residents and as well as this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1957.221s">Many</a> calls have been made to the property owner of Fells Plaza to no avail, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1963.803s">Recently,</a> Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1965.364s">There</a> are a number of drop boxes that were located, if you're familiar with it, at the entrance of where Aldi's is, that goes into the Fells Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1975.532s">And</a> the drop boxes are right next to the entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1978.274s">So</a> when you're pulling in, you can't see the cars that are inside the lot that are coming towards you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1984.059s">It's</a> a very, very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1987.161s">And</a> even though we have an ordinance now that hasn't been signed, but will be signed shortly, you can't legislate common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1995.394s">And</a> common sense would dictate that you don't put these giant mountains of steel next to an entrance and an exit, because it's very difficult to see cars coming and going into the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2009.747s">And</a> it creates a safety concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2012.689s">And</a> even for pedestrians walking by that area, there are a lot of people that walk the Fells Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2018.26s">It's</a> a very dangerous area to walk because of these boxes obstruct vehicles view of oncoming pedestrians or oncoming traffic, which is extremely dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2030.468s">And</a> I hope that we can get some results immediately by having these boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2036.693s">I</a> agree with vice president should be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2042.343s">Mr.</a> President, there's a giant area in the back of the Fells Plaza that you can drive, and maybe that should be where there's signage put for any drop-off blocks for the Fells Plaza, that they'd be located behind the Fells Plaza, which is a safe area and somewhere people can drop donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2062.799s">That</a> area has also become an area where you leave off discarded old TVs, old computers, <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2070.077s">you</a> know, old clothing, you name it, it's been left out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2074.819s">And</a> I don't blame the area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2076.279s">I</a> know we have an area resident, Mr. Poley, up here tonight that would like to speak on the issue, Mr. President, that lives across the street and has to deal with the unsightliness of these boxes and the public health concern with these boxes on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2095.466s">So</a> I want to thank my colleague again for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2098.555s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2099.215s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2414.297s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2415.198s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2416.279s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2417.639s">While</a> we have Mr. Poli here too, he's been a big advocate of placing a pedestrian crosswalk on the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2427.326s">And</a> at the intersection of Bradbury and the Fellsway in particular, there is a current crosswalk there now, but you take your life in your hand crossing because there's no pedestrian controls there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2441.646s">And</a> what happens is you're in a crosswalk, you think you're safe, and the minute the light turns green at Wellington Circle, that becomes a raceway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2451.329s">It's</a> a good half a mile stretch that it becomes a raceway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2456.27s">And</a> if you're caught midway and that fails, let me tell you, trying to cross, you are in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2462.772s">And</a> I see it happen constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2464.652s">And</a> I know Mr. Poli has been a big advocate <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2466.946s">I</a> know this council has voted on several occasions asking our state delegation to look at putting an active pedestrian crossing right there, which is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2476.528s">Tonight</a> we'll be voting on a paper 21-068 from the administration asking that they put a transportation engineer from the money we're getting from Wynn Resorts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2489.731s">And</a> much of that money is targeted for transportation and safety improvements in the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2496.522s">And</a> I can tell you firsthand, there hasn't been much improvement in the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2502.003s">With</a> all this new development going on, that area has received very little upkeep and very little in regards to safety initiatives for pedestrians and vehicular traffic and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2517.447s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President as part of this resolution that we send another message to our state delegation <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2525.667s">asking</a> about an update for a crosswalk at the corner of Bradbury and the Fellsway, a pedestrian crossing in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2538.432s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3192.55s">Any</a> further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3193.671s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3194.831s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3196.372s">I</a> would also ask like we do with most boards and commissions in this community that they hold meetings where we can receive the most community participation and to have a four o'clock meeting in my opinion is not advantageous to attracting a wide amount <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3214.8s">of</a> people into this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3216.962s">So</a> I would ask that they look, I know they scheduled one for February 18th at 4 p.m., but in their next meetings, if they can respectfully look at making this meeting at a later time, Mr. President, for the, to allow for the most input from Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3235.897s">Thank</a> you, Council Member. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3236.717s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3237.518s">Any</a> further questions?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3427.201s">President</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3428.742s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3436.731s">I</a> believe he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3437.812s">City</a> Engineer, are you on the line?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3690.792s">On</a> the approval by Councilor Falco, second by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3696.254s">I</a> do have just a question to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3700.398s">and</a> I will call upon you next Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3703.499s">Are</a> we anticipating that this will be a yearly appropriation that is received from Wynn Resorts and that the funding will be from Wynn Resorts going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3717.326s">Or</a> will this eventually be part of the city budget?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3769.555s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3770.856s">My</a> other question is to the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3773.856s">I</a> know you mentioned that this has an impact on the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3779.578s">However,</a> I believe in living in the Wellington area that Wellington Circle along with the Fellsway, Mystic Valley Parkway and Middlesex Ave will be a brunt of the traffic that is for this casino. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3796.844s">And</a> these are state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3799.985s">And</a> I was wondering maybe if you could talk a little about what we're gonna do in conjunction with the city and the state <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3807.327s">because</a> if these are roads that we have no jurisdiction over, however, they are roads that will be highly used, what are we doing in cooperation with the state to improve vehicular traffic and pedestrian safety in that area?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4021.975s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4022.235s">And</a> my, the reason why I bring it up, I just want to make sure that the fact that there are so many state roads in the area are not an impediment for us to move forward on issues of safety in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4034.023s">because</a> of the fact that we may have to reach out to the state and that adds a whole other layer of red tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4039.406s">I</a> understand that, but I would hope that doesn't add to the layer of complexity when we need to get stuff done in the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4047.649s">Councilor</a> Morell.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4172.891s">Are</a> there any other questions from the council?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4177.187s">Councilor</a> Beals.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4419.627s">We'll</a> second by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4421.829s">Mr.</a> Clerk, call the roll.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4443.225s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4446.548s">Five</a> in the affirmative, two recused. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4449.783s">The</a> motion passes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4712.275s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4715.525s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4716.866s">I</a> just want to add my two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4719.147s">I</a> thought it was a very productive meeting that we held regarding the housing task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4724.769s">Originally,</a> we were looking at the creation of an ordinance to set up this task force, and upon deliberation and more discussion, we currently have a working group, as Councilor Bears mentioned, and we felt best to work with the existing working group <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4743.724s">and</a> not pursue the ordinance avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4746.965s">And</a> I think in that direction, it gives us much more flexibility and much more community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4754.947s">And</a> I look forward to working with this new task force when it's created.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4799.902s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4801.523s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4803.025s">Mr.</a> President, at some point, we do have a number of items under reports due slash deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4809.967s">And</a> I'm not saying we have to take them up now, but at some point we really should go through the reports due and deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4816.068s">And</a> let's just tidy up some council business. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4818.389s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4819.829s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4858.846s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4861.414s">Also,</a> if I could, we did get two correspondence back from the city administration regarding two council papers that were offered by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4870.2s">One</a> being 21-036 regarding the condition of engine four and engine six, the leaking roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4878.205s">And</a> we did get a correspondence back from the city administration saying they're working with procurement and the chief to begin to get quotes and move forward on these very important <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4889.535s">projects,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4890.676s">So</a> that was one correspondence we received from that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4894.917s">And</a> then the other council resolution was regarding the water and sewer base charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4900.239s">I</a> won't read it all, Mr. President, but more or less it mentioned that a million dollars, roughly a million dollars a year goes towards the water and sewer bills in order to keep a flow of money into the account <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4916.63s">And</a> there was a paper I think was offered by Councilor Scarpelli or Vice President Knight regarding the donations that are received through the tax bill for library, police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4930.739s">And</a> if I could Mr. President over the last three fiscal years, fiscal 19, 20 and 21 residents donated $4,719.21. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4944.544s">to</a> the fire station donation, and that was over three year period through their tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4950.427s">The</a> police donation was $2,687.92, and the library donation was $4,892 over the last three fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4953.468s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4954.488s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Martins. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4956.109s">Anything</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4956.489s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4956.669s">Reckons,</a> we're passed to
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4977.909s">Mr.</a> President, I didn't have a chance to look through the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4979.95s">I</a> would ask that they be tabled till next week.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_DNuiAY3aRNM/2024-11-19_DNuiAY3aRNM.html">City Council 02-09-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=128.517s">Mr.</a> President, in the interest of time, I would ask that we waive the remainder of the reading for this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=135.939s">I</a> believe we have three ordinances on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=139.299s">And</a> if we can give just a brief synopsis on what each ordinance is about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=146.361s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=149.321s">The</a> purpose section is pretty good.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=378.701s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=380.602s">Also,</a> if I could, in line with Vice President Knight, I want to thank my council colleagues for their due diligence on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=387.564s">I</a> also want to thank the acting city solicitor and the Board of Health Director for their input regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=395.086s">You</a> know, Mr. President, in this day and age, <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=398.547s">in</a> particular with a pandemic for the past year, health and behavioral health and wellness is now more vital than ever with mental illness and other issues of behavioral health, Mr. President, during this pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=415.638s">And</a> I think it's very important to have a board of such that is comprised of police, fire, health officials, the Director of Veteran Services, <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=427.565s">It</a> runs the gambit, Mr. President, local institutions such as Tufts University, LMH, that can get together and we can get the input from many different organizations that see mental health and the wellness and health in many different lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=448.977s">in</a> this community, and I think it's important to bring all that knowledge together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=452.938s">And</a> that's what this is going to accomplish, so we can have one, as it states, depository of information that gathers information from every aspect, whether it's a veteran in the community, someone that may be homeless, someone that's experiencing housing instability, whatever the case may be, mental illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=473.543s">have</a> a central depository where we can work on issues vital to residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=479.672s">And</a> I want to thank my colleagues for their due diligence on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=609.664s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=610.985s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=612.106s">Just</a> to address Diane's point, we worked long and hard to try to keep the number to a manageable number. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=618.811s">And</a> I agree that lived experience is truly important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=622.814s">And</a> under the representation, the mayor also has three appointments, which could be someone with lived experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=631.761s">And</a> also don't discount the fact that people that may be sitting on the board currently <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=636.826s">other</a> capacities may also have lived experience as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=640.111s">So</a> I think we can't judge based on someone's position or their status, they too may have lived experience as well.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=946.386s">I'll</a> just be brief because I think Councilor Knight hit the nail on the head regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=951.131s">For</a> many years, these collection bins have existed in the community without any proper permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=957.116s">And</a> I think this will go a long way to ensure residents of this community that may live next to an area that has a bin or may come in contact with a bin, that these bins are regulated by the community, by the city, and indeed adhere to all the rules and regulations which currently now we do have as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=979.628s">And</a> I just want to thank my colleagues for their attention to this important <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=983.33s">matter.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1061.717s">Mr.</a> President, I move to cancel the rest of the reading and give a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1067.819s">Second.</a>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1274.359s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1275.64s">And</a> I'll be brief on this one, but this is a long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1279.983s">Pest</a> control in the city, pest control management has been an issue for, I'd like to say, 10, 15, 20 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1289.25s">It</a> really has been a concern over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1291.831s">It</a> comes and goes, depends on the time of season, depends on what's happening in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1296.832s">But</a> it exists and it's there, and it's a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1301.113s">And</a> I think this ordinance goes a long way to rectify some of the concerns that residents have regarding pest control in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1310.135s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues because it wasn't part of this ordinance, but we did vote on a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1319.057s">which</a> is an administrative policy, this council requested as an administrative policy that the city administration set up a policy that would allow us to sign a waiver to deal with private homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1333.865s">For</a> instance, Mr. President, you may have an area of your yard that has a rat nest unbeknownst to yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1343.27s">However,</a> the city has located this because it's on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1348.054s">It</a> is the owner's responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1351.136s">I</a> think the city council saw fit to say, you know what, we have an obligation as a community to try to address needs that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1360.844s">And</a> whether it's financial or not, if we can assist in a common goal <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1367.168s">the</a> eradication of these pests, I think that's something we should move forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1372.692s">And</a> having a waiver that would hold the city free from liability and also accomplishing the same goals of pest control, I think help create a better policy and a better ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1388.103s">And</a> I want to thank my colleagues for passing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1390.524s">I</a> also want to thank the Director of Border Health and the Assistant City Solicitor for their input on this ordinance as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1399.687s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Locks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1864.869s">Councilor</a> Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1866.624s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1867.504s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for putting this on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1871.465s">You</a> know, Victor's Deli, although it was in Somerville, I considered it a Medford restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1877.947s">Many</a> Medford people attended Victor's Deli. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1881.288s">You</a> know, the home-cooked meals made you feel like you were at home, as my colleagues mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1885.649s">And</a> when you went in there and got a sandwich, it tasted like you were at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1888.87s">It</a> tasted like you were eating with your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1891.791s">And</a> the atmosphere was the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1893.711s">And</a> that's how they always ran the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1896.052s">And</a> Mrs. Mosher was truly, as my colleagues mentioned, a family person. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1902.976s">Family</a> meant everything to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1905.317s">And</a> you can see that in her kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1907.478s">You</a> can see it in the way they carried themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1910.2s">And</a> she will be solely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1912.841s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1913.641s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2065.849s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2067.59s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2069.231s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2209.359s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2210.781s">And</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2212.312s">I</a> stated this a couple of weeks ago and it is still true that Massachusetts is considered a national healthcare leader with many of the top healthcare providers residing in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2229.224s">Eight</a> weeks after the first COVID vaccines were authorized, <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2233.767s">in</a> Massachusetts, we rank in the bottom half of U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2239.832s">states</a> in getting the injection to our residents and to our most vulnerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2246.177s">Massachusetts</a> trails every other New England state, including as well as New York, in the number of vaccine doses administered per capita, and that's according to federal figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2261.403s">This</a> has been a concern, Mr. President, not of mine, but of many residents in this community, as well as my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2269.337s">for</a> some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2271.078s">There's</a> been some confusion recently with reverse 911 calls alerting residents to contact City Hall, the Council on Aging, the West Medford Community Center regarding the vaccination and I guess how to get assistance on where to go for a vaccination if you're 75 or older. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2297.977s">I'm</a> not concerned about pointing blame or looking back at why Massachusetts is in the predicament it's in right now, but I would like to look forward, Mr. President, and get some answers from our Board of Health regarding what is the next phase in rollout in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2319.381s">And</a> I think it's important to find out what the plan is, because there's so much misinformation going around. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2326.644s">And</a> we heard last week from the Board of Health Director that maybe the call that was made wasn't intended to create a list of potential residents that are 75 and older. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2341.81s">to</a> wait for a vaccination or for a call back. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2345.132s">However,</a> that was the case for many residents that called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2349.755s">They</a> thought they were on a list waiting for someone to get back to them to state when they'll get this shot locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2357.579s">Now,</a> I realize the state set up a 2-1-1 system, which I guess has been somewhat effective in Massachusetts in getting the message out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2369.986s">and</a> also simplifying the process of applying for this vaccination. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2376.575s">There</a> are many residents right now that don't have access to a computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2381.442s">And</a> under the old system with the state, you had to go online. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2385.868s">to</a> fill out an application, a multi-page application, in which some residents weren't able to access, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2394.616s">So</a> I'm eager to hear from the Board of Health Director regarding what the plans are for the rollout in Method for our seniors 75 and older. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2405.365s">I</a> got a call this afternoon from a senior that said she received a call from the Method Council on aging. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2413.713s">and</a> they asked if she was still interested in getting the vaccination and that it would be available at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2423.425s">at</a> the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2425.546s">That</a> was the vaccination site for our first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2430.267s">And</a> apparently that will be the vaccination site for seniors that are 75 and older. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2440.089s">Again,</a> in this community, there may be a number of sites that are available to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2447.817s">There</a> was also talk, Mr. President, and I forget where I saw it or read it, that the governor is putting the phase two on hold now for residents 65 to 74. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2460.488s">And</a> that is quite alarming as well, because this is not something that you say, well, I may or may not get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2468.654s">I</a> may decide to get it when I have some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2471.917s">This</a> is life or death that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2474.658s">This</a> is people that may have co-morbidities that, you know, need to get the shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2479.521s">This</a> is people that are seniors that, you know, can't leave their home because they're infirm, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2486.845s">And</a> a mask only goes so far in hand-washing and social distancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2491.647s">And</a> the thought of having a vaccination that <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2496.79s">could</a> at least assist residents, I think goes a long way to assure people that they'll be safe during these tough and difficult times. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2506.873s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President, I don't know if the Board of Health Director is on the call, but if she's not-. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2514.195s">If</a> she's not, Mr. President, I would ask that we receive an immediate update to the Medford City Council regarding what the plans are for the rollout, where the sites will be in Medford, how will residents be notified, how will we assist residents, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2533.197s">There</a> are many vulnerable residents out there that don't have the access, they don't have the whereabouts to do this on their own, and they need assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2542.741s">And</a> they need someone to step in, and in this case, city government, to step in and assist these residents that are in need, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2552.365s">And</a> that should be our number one concern right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2555.507s">When</a> you bump into a senior and you think they're of age or 75 or above, the first question should be, have you received your shot? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2564.072s">The</a> second question should be, if not, how can I assist you? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2568.574s">And</a> that should be everyone asking, your neighbor, your cousin, your family member, someone you may bump into in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2575.298s">And</a> that really should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2577.579s">the</a> outcry to get this process underway and moving forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2583.103s">Many</a> of these state centers, from my own experience in trying to help my own family member, to go maybe to Fenway Park or Gillette Stadium, may be out of reach for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2597.614s">I've</a> called the Melrose Wakefield Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2603.179s">It's</a> very difficult to get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2606.2s">The</a> appointments are not there, and I realize this is still in the early stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2611.563s">But</a> I think more has to come from this community, because we'd like to service our seniors, Mr. President, in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2621.968s">We'd</a> like to service them in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2625.335s">I</a> had the opportunity to go to Fenway Park just yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2629.558s">And</a> I saw and witnessed firsthand many seniors, Mr. President, waiting long, winding roads in gate B and gate A that circled and circled. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2643.449s">And</a> these are people that, honestly, Mr. President, I don't think should be waiting in a line for 45 minutes to an hour waiting to get their vaccination. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2655.438s">And</a> I think how a society treats their seniors says a lot about society. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2661.983s">And</a> in my opinion, if the vaccination's not available, and I hear what the mayor's saying that it's not available, we have to do our very best to make sure that we're assisting our seniors get this vaccination, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2677.474s">It's</a> the utmost of importance for us as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2681.736s">And</a> I look eager and forward to when we get a response back from the Board of Health Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2688.4s">We</a> probably should be hearing from the Board of Health Director every Tuesday, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2694.888s">I'm</a> not sure why we don't have just a regular every Tuesday that we get a five-minute conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2701.21s">What's</a> going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2702.351s">How's</a> the rollout? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2703.531s">What</a> are the next steps? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2705.032s">I</a> don't think we need to ask this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2707.433s">This</a> should be a given. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2709.113s">A</a> lot of seniors tune in on this meeting, and they get their information from this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2714.075s">They're</a> not getting it from local papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2715.836s">They're</a> certainly not getting it from the Internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2718.317s">So</a> they're getting it, Mr. President, from maybe watching this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2722.558s">And</a> they're certainly not getting it from gatherings because we can't gather anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2727.866s">So</a> I think it's very important that that take place as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2732.553s">And</a> I would ask that moving forward, if our health director, I know she's busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2738.241s">I'm</a> not downplaying her role, very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2741.302s">But</a> if she can give us five minutes on a Tuesday night to give us an update, I think it would go a long way to alerting this council that feels a lot of phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2750.846s">But</a> as well as the many, many seniors and other residents that can alert their loved ones on what's happening and information that will be vital to their health, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2761.851s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3707.323s">Okay,</a> so on the motion, Mr. President, just if I could, Mr. President, and when this pandemic first started, the city administration implemented the R U OK program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3722.959s">And</a> in my opinion, that was a tremendous success, reaching out to thousands of seniors in this community by phone, Mr. President, or by email, and asking if they are OK and if they had any particular needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3738.625s">And</a> I just think this would be a great program to extend regarding the vaccinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3745.389s">And</a> I know you were involved, Mr. President, in making the phone calls when this first started. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3750.292s">And</a> you made hundreds of phone calls out to seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3753.635s">And</a> you would know firsthand that the many thousands of seniors in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3759.438s">whether</a> they're in the process of getting an injection on their own or so forth, it would be so nice to get a call from city government to say, are you okay now? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3769.705s">Do</a> you need assistance with the vaccine? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3772.948s">And</a> if the answer is no, then you go on to the next person. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3776.45s">And</a> I think that would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3778.312s">So</a> I would respectfully ask as part of an amendment that the mayor use the <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3786.317s">our</a> UOK program, which was very successful, and extend that to, do you need a vaccination program? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3794.064s">And</a> reach out to all the seniors in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3797.147s">Right</a> now, we're looking at phase one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3798.988s">But</a> if you're 65 and older, in my opinion, you should be on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3803.972s">They're</a> saying 75 and older now for phase one, and that's fine, and other people with medical conditions and comorbidities and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3812.019s">But</a> I think they should be looking at, the city should be reaching out to people 65 and older, Mr. President, and making those thousands of calls, and let residents know we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3822.527s">Let</a> them know we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3823.567s">We</a> get the reverse 911 call, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3827.028s">We</a> can see it on local access, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3829.409s">But</a> the personal phone call really goes a long way to let people know, hey, I matter, I care, and someone's looking out for my best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3837.651s">And</a> I think we're obligated to do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3840.031s">So</a> I'd ask that as an amendment as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4229.902s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4230.783s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4232.304s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Falco for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4235.687s">This</a> has been a priority of this council for a number of years to get its own representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4242.052s">It's</a> no different than the Medford School Committee that has their own legal council of which this council on a number of issues I think would benefit from having legal advice that's towards the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4259.765s">And</a> with that statement being made, Mr. President, I do want to say the current acting city solicitor has been acting city solicitor for over a year now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4271.873s">One</a> year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4273.774s">And</a> it's about time the city administration makes a move. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4279.264s">And</a> in my opinion, they should make the current acting city solicitor the city solicitor and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4285.789s">There's</a> no reason why that position should be held over anyone's head for any length of time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4293.235s">As</a> was stated by my colleagues, the person in that role was the assistant city solicitor under former solicitor Mark Rumley, where I'm sure she learned a lot from solicitor Rumley that was there for over three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4307.947s">And</a> I am very confident in her capabilities, Mr. President, as the lead legal counsel in this community, and would respectfully ask that this city administration, they tend to slow down when it comes to appointments and a number of other items, Mr. President, that they appoint this city, acting city solicitor, as city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4332.392s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4872.496s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4873.077s">Councilor</a> Locks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4874.298s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4875.098s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Falco for offering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4878.221s">Last</a> week, the Office of Community Development held a housing planning meeting, of which yourself and I attended, as well as many stakeholders in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4890.651s">And</a> we got together for an hour and a half and put together a list of <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4894.955s">priorities</a> for housing stability and other housing needs in the community, and of which notification ordinance was one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4904.143s">So</a> I want to thank my council colleague for taking one of the items potentially off the laundry list of housing needs in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4914.611s">And</a> I think that'll go a long way to notifying tenants of their rights in this community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5031.284s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5032.084s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5034.534s">If</a> we can also get an update from our state delegation, where this particular request, home rule petition stands as well, so we can hear directly from our state delegation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5047.46s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5048.58s">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5048.98s">So</a> moved.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5178.573s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5181.799s">Just</a> if I can ask, because when was the original date, if any, that the council asked for applications for this position?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5205.617s">But</a> the mayor hasn't passed anything on to us saying- I haven't got anything that I haven't seen.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5223.246s">Okay,</a> so I think it's fair to say that the administration didn't receive any applications based on the one appointment we have to the Hormel Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5231.888s">I</a> would just respectfully ask that we extend this date. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5235.189s">publicly</a> state tonight as a council that we will extend it to X date, whatever we agree upon, for applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5243.492s">That</a> way there's no ambiguity, there's no concern.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5260.137s">And</a> the application should be submitted to the council president or vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5264.852s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5265.373s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5266.033s">So</a> that's what we've done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5267.595s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5268.535s">Um,</a> and, uh, expressing interest in the Hormel, uh, position.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5326.907s">Just</a> if we could, I just want to make sure maybe if we could put this on community access to get the message out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5333.392s">We</a> don't have many, other than this meeting, we don't have a lot of ways of getting our message out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5338.356s">Or</a> maybe the city administration on behalf of the council can send it out through their channels that we're interested in someone to serve on this board and commission in the capacity of a commissioner of Hormel. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5351.746s">Just</a> trying to think of a couple of ways to get it out there.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6484.81s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6486.592s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6487.612s">I</a> just want to understand what I'm voting on because I think it was mentioned that this would not apply to city-owned property. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6497.04s">And</a> if that's the case, Mr. President, how do we tell the hundreds of residents in the community that may live next to city-owned property that gets mowed very frequently <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6508.45s">that</a> their leaf blowers that are being used by the city are not causing pollutants, including carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide, or their leaf blowers don't operate at high decibel levels next to their homes, or their leaf blowers don't launch particulates, potentially hazardous to materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6531.998s">So</a> are we going to discount <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6533.658s">hundreds</a> of residents and say this only applies on private lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6538.422s">I</a> don't know what we're going after, Mr. President, on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6541.144s">Because</a> if we're going to look into something, I think we should look into it as a whole, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6547.148s">And</a> if we're going to look into issues of particulates and air pollutants, I can tell you that my lawnmower probably sends out as much particulates and pollution as a gas blower does. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6559.678s">And</a> I can tell you that my snow blower does the same thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6564.262s">So</a> I just don't know where we're going with the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6567.165s">Is</a> this just because other communities have implemented it? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6571.39s">We</a> also have noise ordinances within this community that regulate noise levels and decimal levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6577.016s">We</a> just had an issue with Spring Staff about playing loud music at 11, 12 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6582.722s">that</a> we're trying to resolve, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6584.764s">So</a> there are means in this community to address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6588.767s">If</a> the issue is that we want to address these during certain hours of the day or the frequency, then fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6595.152s">And</a> I think we should be more specific on what the intent is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6600.036s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6600.996s">And</a> if we're really interested in these issues, how do you discount people that live next door to a park? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6607.561s">I'd</a> like someone to address that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6631.544s">But</a> you just also alluded to the fact that you meant to put in there, this was only private lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6639.523s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6639.743s">Did</a> you just say that to me?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6646.567s">You</a> just flip-flopped on the issue twice already on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6649.929s">You</a> said it was private lots and now you're saying you're happy to have the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6653.572s">That's</a> all we're saying as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6655.373s">Let's</a> look at this and try to address the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6659.155s">Now</a> we can't go back and forth flip-flopping.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6759.537s">Councilor</a> Mark says the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6761.843s">We'll</a> talk one at a time so we can make an educated and informed decision, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6766.746s">So</a> I just want to make sure, because the resolution's asking for one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6770.688s">If</a> there's an amendment, I want to make sure that amendment is acceptable to all my colleagues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6775.411s">And</a> I want to make sure that we're talking about apples and not comparing apples to oranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6781.054s">Because</a> we've heard a lot of things go back and forth regarding lots, private lots, city-owned lots being exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6787.578s">And</a> I want to make sure we're on the same page.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_bJDrOFPloZA/2024-11-19_bJDrOFPloZA.html">City Council 02-02-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=144.324s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=145.344s">I</a> am still waiting for additional information on this subject and would ask that it be tabled.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=897.254s">Just</a> if we could, what are the next steps regarding this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=919.962s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=920.642s">So</a> if they fail to appear in the past, one would think they're probably not gonna appear again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=925.725s">So</a> what are the next steps by the city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=930.527s">I</a> support this, but I wanna support something that has some tea to it and something that we can act upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=936.87s">And</a> I'm not quite sure that we're there with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=941.012s">I</a> know the intent, and I support the intent, but I'd like to see some other steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=947.014s">Waiting</a> for them to come to a meeting, which may never happen, to me is not a next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=952.376s">But</a> like I said, I am supportive.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=995.414s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=996.595s">So,</a> Mr. President, are we aware of any particular pieces of legislation that we can look at? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1001.418s">That</a> would be helpful.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1543.538s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1544.759s">And</a> thank you for putting this on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1548.944s">You</a> couldn't meet a kinder, gentler man. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1552.108s">You</a> know, when I first got elected so many years ago, he was one of the first people that I met at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1557.915s">And</a> in his capacity as the registrar of voters, you know, he was a very fair man, Tom, if you knew him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1565.845s">You</a> know, he took his job very seriously, although he was one that you could talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1570.627s">He</a> was old fashioned in that way, that he'd be willing to lend an ear, lend advice, and he always kept conversations to himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1581.31s">and</a> just a true family man and someone that will be sorely missed at City Hall, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1589.292s">And</a> I, too, want to send out my deepest condolence to his family and friends, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2203.715s">And</a> I want to thank my colleague, Vice President Knight, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2207.416s">During</a> the deliberation, we were very careful when we selected the 90-day process to allow the Cannabis Advisory Committee to have enough time to do their due diligence and establish the scoring system and the process that they were going to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2224.282s">There</a> was originally discussion, if members recall, of a 30-day process, and we didn't think that was adequate enough where you have <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2231.845s">department</a> heads that have another workload and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2234.687s">So</a> we were very mindful when we set up the 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2238.089s">So</a> I think that timeframe should be adhered to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2243.112s">And</a> this process, after a lengthy process over the last couple of years, this should be adhered to, Mr. President, and move forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2714.878s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2716.079s">And,</a> um, I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing this up tonight, uh, where he stated this is a very specific ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2723.746s">He</a> is a thousand percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2726.328s">And</a> the issue I would have, Mr. President, is that, uh, I would ask that this be properly vetted before it's sent to the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2734.82s">uh,</a> sent to the public, uh, safety, um, subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2739.367s">Um,</a> this has a lot of language in it, Mr. President, that if implemented could have some serious ramifications, uh, to residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2750.035s">And</a> I understand this is a specific ask for certain things, but as was stated within the last part of this, that the traffic commission consider safeguards as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2762.059s">And</a> to limit the number of consecutive days, a public hearing take place, restricting vehicle size. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2768.821s">how</a> far they can park from a resident, from the address that was given. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2773.706s">So</a> I think there's a lot involved with this, and I would hate to send such an important potential change without it properly being vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2784.114s">And</a> I would ask that we have our due diligence, take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2789.118s">There</a> may be some language in there that <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2791.56s">the</a> traffic commission runs with, that the council may say, you know what, that wasn't our intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2796.345s">But</a> it's here in the writing, it's here in the resolution that we supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2800.228s">And</a> I would ask that we send it to the public safety subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2806.153s">And</a> also, as was stated, we also have a committee that was put together, commissioned by <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2811.818s">the</a> mayor that's doing their homework and due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2814.66s">I</a> believe I just read they had over 900 responses so far to the survey that was sent out and that's citywide and I think taking into consideration all these particular questions and concerns and issues that are out there is probably a holistic way of looking at it rather than piecemeal and I would prefer that method but <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2838.152s">I</a> would respectfully ask my colleague, Vice President Knight, if we can send this to the subcommittee on public safety to have it properly vetted before we send out such a request.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2901.812s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2906.335s">I</a> appreciate that, and I understand that it is under the authority of the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2910.718s">However,</a> this is making specific recommendations, and there's at least five recommendations, then other requests of the Traffic Commission that are involved in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2922.245s">And</a> all I'm saying is, if I give it my stamp of approval, this was written by, I don't know who, maybe Councilor Naira, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2929.27s">came</a> from some other community or so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2931.672s">I</a> haven't had the opportunity to properly vet it and properly get input. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2936.715s">And</a> I think a subcommittee would be the appropriate balance to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2940.757s">I</a> understand that's not us that's going to implement this and enact this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2945.36s">But</a> to get this on the agenda and for the first time, send it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2949.963s">If</a> you want to send a basic statement that they look at commercial vehicle overnight parking, I'll support that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2957.188s">But</a> based on what's in here, there are a lot of recommendations in here, and I don't feel comfortable sending them.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4086.014s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4088.196s">And</a> I want to thank whoever got us that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4091.938s">That</a> was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4093.999s">The</a> question actually that I asked was the jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4098.502s">And</a> it's my belief that the jurisdiction of Thomas Brooks PAC falls under the PAC's commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4107.488s">And</a> I was wondering if this has been presented for a formal vote to the PAC's commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4113.527s">Not</a> the PAC's department or public works, but the PAC commission.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4134.782s">So</a> I would respectfully ask, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4139.64s">that</a> if we do take a vote tonight, I'm prepared to take a vote, but the vote will be contingent upon, and this is for the dig itself, the approval by the Parks Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4153.433s">This</a> subject should be before the Parks Commission for approval, Mr. President, and let them decide whether or not they approve it or not, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4177.153s">I</a> would ask that, you know, if we wanted to vote on tonight, I have no problem with that, but I'll vote be contingent upon approval by the park commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4185.659s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4187.0s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4187.781s">I</a> know we have supporting documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4190.163s">from</a> Brian Cairns and from Mike Nesta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4194.625s">However,</a> as far as I know, this falls under the jurisdiction of the Park Commission and the issue rightfully should be presented to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4202.409s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4203.33s">Vice</a> President Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4332.382s">And</a> I thank Ryan for his comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4334.166s">And</a> I don't think anyone's opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4336.592s">we</a> just wanna make sure we're following the proper protocol. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4340.134s">And</a> I had a conversation just recently within the past maybe hour, an hour and a half with one of the park commission members. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4347.658s">And</a> they said they had a number of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4350.819s">Actually,</a> they were asking me the questions I couldn't answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4354.821s">And</a> they were surprised that it wasn't before the park commission for a formal vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4361.745s">So</a> I really think that we need to revisit this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4365.007s">Again,</a> I have no problem voting contingent upon their approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4369.47s">But</a> as long as I've been on the council, anything done on park property has always come under the jurisdiction of the park commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4378.296s">And</a> I don't see this as any different, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4381.259s">And</a> I think we have to follow the proper protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4384.561s">Really,</a> that should have been the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4386.422s">before,</a> you know, coming to the council, but I have no problem moving forward with it if we make it contingent upon approval by the Park Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4396.344s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4398.284s">Danielle?</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4447.132s">When</a> you say that type of work, when you're talking about digging in a park, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4454.75s">I</a> mean, I can't see any more of a reason why you'd go to a park commission, Mr. President, and ask for their blessing, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4465.06s">And</a> I mean, I realize the Thomas Brooks Park is kind of off the beaten track and not fully utilized, but this could be any park that they request. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4473.988s">It</a> could be the middle of place that park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4476.23s">And</a> I would assume you'd want to follow the same proper protocols <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4479.333s">and</a> procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4480.834s">And</a> I just don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4483.256s">If</a> that's the case, maybe I'll go pick up a shovel and start digging in our box. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4487.04s">I</a> mean, it doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4585.76s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4587.541s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4589.162s">When</a> we're comparing apples to oranges, you're talking about a capital plan, which clearly the Park Commission wouldn't have the authority to do any type of capital plan because they don't control the purse strings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4600.009s">What</a> we're talking about is the jurisdiction to have someone go onto park property <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4604.592s">and</a> start excavating on park property, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4607.916s">I</a> would say that needs approval by the Park Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4610.859s">And</a> even if it didn't, Mr. President, at the very least, before money's approved, that should have been vetted out by the Park Commission, whose sole responsibility is the oversight of the park, Mr. President, and the safety of our parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4624.873s">Because</a> we don't know what's going to happen when they start excavating, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4629.197s">We</a> don't know if it's going to be cordoned off accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4633.021s">We</a> don't know any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4634.802s">And</a> the park commission, the commissioner that I spoke to tonight, had a lot of questions on what type of vehicles would be used in there and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4643.791s">And</a> I think at the very least, Mr. President, where they're the commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4648.275s">Now,</a> if this was a CPC thing and someone said you didn't have to go to CPC for it, I would fight for the fact that CPC should be involved if it was something that's under their jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4658.723s">This</a> is no different, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4660.665s">And</a> I don't think we should circumvent an established commission in the... I don't know why we'd do it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4668.791s">I</a> think all the members are probably on board, but they really have questions from a member I spoke to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4674.915s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5756.892s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5758.125s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5759.066s">I</a> just think it's important for the edification of the people watching that we met in committee of the whole to discuss all these particular requests and had ample dialogue and discussion and properly vetted this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5773.837s">So,</a> you know, if someone's tuning in tonight, I don't want them to believe that there's no discussion on the allocations that are presented to us.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6376.683s">All</a> right, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6379.984s">Just</a> if I could, I wanted to speak on the Brian Branson. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6382.445s">I</a> wanted to thank all my colleagues, because that was a unanimous vote by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6387.386s">And</a> I want to thank the athletic director, Robert Maloney, for his quick action and due diligence, and Hank Moss for his participation in moving this forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6398.569s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6399.824s">Good</a> people doing good things, thank you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6467.233s">City</a> Hall, okay.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6471.035s">That's</a> correct, thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_r-A28SRNwTU/2024-11-19_r-A28SRNwTU.html">City Council 01-26-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=46.419s">Yes,</a> please read your speech.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1190.319s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1192.14s">Regarding</a> the stone wall itself, will the $200,000 cover the entire length of the wall, Doug?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1202.99s">So</a> we don't anticipate coming back for any additional money for the wall itself?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1213.119s">My</a> second question is Thomas Brooks Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1216.906s">Is</a> that fall under the jurisdiction of the Method Parks Commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1224.109s">I</a> believe so, but I'm not 100% sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1226.45s">Roberta,</a> do you know?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1240.476s">So</a> did we get authorization to do a dig on parkland?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1329.792s">Right,</a> so that's why, Mr. President, I asked the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1333.336s">So</a> the question is, if this is under the jurisdiction of the Medford Park Commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1340.104s">then</a> they really should give the authority to do digging, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1346.248s">And</a> I'm not saying that's not going to be a given, but before we release any money, that should be something that, Mr. President, should be done before the request for money to start digging takes place.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1369.884s">Well,</a> they have to find out if it's under their jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1372.806s">If</a> not their jurisdiction, then they would have to contact the administration or the building commissioner or whoever else. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1379.81s">would</a> be responsible for city-owned property, maybe the city solicitor, and find out what avenues that have to address in order to do digging, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1390.701s">So</a> I would highly recommend that that take place, Mr. President, in order to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1396.567s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1720.122s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1721.003s">I</a> want to thank Vice President Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for co-sponsoring this important resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1727.267s">I</a> want to thank Councilor and Vice President Knight in particular for keeping this on our agenda to make sure that along this entire process that our residents have been made aware of updates and what's going on on that particular site. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1742.257s">Mr.</a> President, I have just a few things to mention that I spoke about a couple weeks back when we talked about new signage that has been popping up in the Forest Street, Governor's Ave area, which was a combined effort between the city of Medford and the hospital to work on some safety concerns in the general vicinity, of which many of the improvements that have been made <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1771.075s">I</a> think have really improved public safety and speeding in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1776.92s">The</a> one thing I would like to mention, Mr. President, is I have been receiving a number of complaints, and I'm sure my fellow colleagues have also, regarding the speed hump at the top of Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1790.71s">I</a> recently reached out to the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, had a discussion about some of the signage, and some of the residents that live directly near this speed hump are concerned that it's not having the impact that you would think a speed hump would have, slowing down traffic in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1813.715s">And</a> they're not sure if it's the elevation <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1816.475s">that</a> cars are just going over it without tapping their brake or slowing down, or the fact that it blends in with the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1825.621s">There</a> are a number of concerns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1828.183s">And</a> I would ask, and I'm hoping to hear tonight from LMH, what possibly can be done, and maybe even our traffic engineer, to take a look at this speed hump. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1840.31s">Because</a> we want to make sure if we're putting traffic calming initiatives that they serve a purpose and not just to say we did something. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1851.404s">And</a> from what I'm hearing from area residents, that hump right now they don't believe is serving a purpose because of its location and proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1859.814s">to</a> Saltwater Road and the proximity to the elevation of Governor's Ave, it's not really serving a purpose at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1868.502s">So</a> I would ask that that be looked at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1871.164s">The</a> second complaint, Mr. President, and I think the hospital is going to speak upon it and expand tonight regarding exterior lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1879.471s">I</a> know the owners of 179 Governor's Ave have reached out to members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1884.975s">concerned</a> about some new lighting that I guess at night is shining in some of the residents across Governor's Ave into their windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1894.643s">I</a> would ask that that exterior lighting be looked at, the lumens, the direction of the light, and see if we could put low lighting lights in their exterior lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1907.392s">that</a> won't cause the same impact to butters across the street on Governor Zav, in particular 179. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1914.415s">So</a> I would ask that LMH do a study on their lights and see what's happening with the lights outside, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1924.9s">And</a> the last point I want to make, and I spoke about it last week briefly, was the fact that we all received an email from community advisory group members, of which two of them sent a letter stating that they're resigning for a number of reasons from the community advisory group after giving a couple years of commitment on behalf of area residents to be the eyes and ears of area residents during this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1954.638s">And</a> I would just hope that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, who came up with the idea with creating this community advisory group, which I thought was a magnificent idea, continue their efforts to work with this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1969.599s">to</a> make sure that they feel part of the process and be given updates along the entire process, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1976.404s">Now</a> that this is up and functioning, it's even more important now than when we were going through construction and everything else, because now we're going to hear from residents about a working facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1988.011s">And</a> the concern with parking, and traffic, and speeding, and signage, and noise, and everything associated with having a full-fledged ambulatory care facility in this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1999.308s">And</a> it's of the utmost importance that Lawrence Memorial keep with their commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2004.255s">to</a> making sure that they involve the community advisory group as well as the entire city and anything that takes place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2012.858s">So</a> I would just ask that that be part of their discussions, Mr. President, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2017.68s">And</a> I look forward to hear what has to be stated tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2021.462s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2022.242s">Councilor</a> Scott Beally.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2834.562s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2835.763s">So</a> Mr. President, I was told by Todd Blake that this was a combined work effort between LMH in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2846.273s">So</a> if this aspect was the city's doing, then I would ask that my motion be sent to Todd Blake, the traffic engineer directly and ask if he can take a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2856.222s">the</a> speed hump at the top of Governor's Ave and to see if it's appropriately functioning in its capacity as a speed hump due to its location to Governor's Ave and the fact that it's going up in elevation, which you very seldom see speed humps on inclines, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2874.241s">So</a> I would ask that that be reviewed by our traffic engineer.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3982.568s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3983.949s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3984.77s">I</a> want to thank councilor Falco for co-sponsoring this resolution with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3989.753s">Uh,</a> this council has made great strides over the last several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3993.616s">I</a> think, you know, we should all be proud of ourself for the initiative, Mr. President, that we took to meet with the area residents, uh, on Fulton spring road to listen to their concerns, Mr. President, when many of them thought that, uh, the city didn't care about, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4008.346s">cut</a> through traffic and speeding in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4010.667s">And</a> indeed, a number of changes have been made up in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4015.148s">We</a> haven't, you know, we're not done with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4018.209s">A</a> number of changes have been made to take corrective action on some of the concerns of area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4025.531s">And</a> this is just another one, Mr. President, that will help provide for pedestrian safety in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4031.593s">I</a> want to just reiterate, Mr. President, I know you just <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4034.474s">sent</a> out your committee, the whole, um, outstanding meetings that, uh, we have a committee, the whole that this council voted on, I believe at least twice, uh, to maintain a presence in that area regarding, uh, safety and cut through traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4051.77s">And</a> I would ask once again, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4053.852s">when</a> we start going through these meetings that we have a committee of the whole to discuss what I believe is the most important issue in that area, resident only access on certain roads, Molly Hill Road, Fulton Spring Road, Terrace Road, Grover Road, in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4071.446s">I</a> think we could put all the signage up and all the humps and hurdles and everything else, but unless we defer traffic somewhere else, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4081.695s">I</a> think the residents didn't experience and be inundated with this cut through traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4087.421s">So</a> at the very least, I think we should try the resident only access or no right turn, no left turn between certain hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4095.468s">I</a> talked to the city traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4098.071s">He</a> said sometimes the resident only is not that effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4102.055s">He</a> said, however, a no right or no left turn can <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4105.378s">resolve</a> the same issues, and I'm not opposed to any signage that would solve the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4113.383s">So</a> I look forward to meeting with this council and committee to hold to keep this very important issue up, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4124.83s">I</a> don't believe we have to go on site again at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4127.971s">I</a> think we've all been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4129.311s">It's</a> just a matter of keeping this issue in the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4132.332s">And</a> two weeks ago, I believe I offered a motion that was unanimously supported by this council, asking the traffic engineer and the traffic commission to once again look at resident only signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4143.876s">I</a> don't know, Mr. Clerk, if we got a response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4146.077s">I</a> don't remember seeing anything on that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4154.763s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4155.483s">I</a> don't recall seeing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4156.705s">So</a> that's one of the reasons, Mr. President, I ask that we stay on top of these very important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4161.509s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4251.331s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4253.652s">Several</a> months back, the city administration put together several task force, of which one is the Fire Department Facilities Task Force. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4263.616s">They've</a> been meeting, I guess, for several months with all the interested parties in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4269.898s">And</a> it's my understanding that we have several concerns, immediate concerns, regarding engine four and engine six. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4278.762s">for</a> leaking roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4280.524s">And</a> these are the buildings that our brave firefighters spend seven days a week, 24 hours a day in when they're not on calls, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4290.375s">And</a> it's only important that we stay on top of these aging buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4295.74s">I</a> did receive a call this afternoon from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4300.802s">The</a> mayor stated that they're in the process of hiring a project manager, so once the task force makes their recommendation, they will hire a project manager, and that project manager will be responsible for putting together all the items that the task force discussed on our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4320.207s">As</a> you recall, Mr. President, I think everyone behind this rail <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4323.708s">was</a> part of the site visits at the fire station, at all our fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4330.11s">And</a> we compiled several lists over the last several years, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4336.092s">And</a> many of which have not come to fruition on some of the major concerns that our firefighters face within these aging facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4347.176s">And</a> I'm hoping that this task force will reap some results in moving forward on at least addressing some of the health and safety concerns that our firefighters face, not only in fires, but unfortunately at the fire stations as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4363.621s">And</a> that's, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4366.062s">a</a> concern that's been around this community for a number of years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4369.885s">So</a> I would ask that we receive an update from the city administration regarding Engine 4 and Engine 6 roof leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4378.111s">And</a> if we can get an update, because it's been a while, on the task force, where it stands, when the recommendations will be out, and when they anticipate a project manager will be hired to move forward on these important issues.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4407.118s">We</a> get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4407.798s">Right,</a> an update about engine four and engine six, the roof leaks, and when the task force will be, if we can get an update on the task force, where it stands, and when a project manager will be brought on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4420.301s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4422.162s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4954.954s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4958.037s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4959.338s">And</a> I don't have any particular questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4963.821s">I</a> do agree with Councilor Knight that this definitely should be signed off by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4969.246s">I</a> would ask and maybe, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4974.987s">The</a> petitioner would know better than I that if we were to hold off, we don't meet until February 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4982.032s">Is</a> that enough lead time if we were to hold off on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4986.375s">I</a> don't mind making our paper contingent upon approval from the school committee, which I think may be a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4993.321s">The</a> fee that's being charged, this is a fundraiser if people want to go and partake. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4999.845s">They'll</a> pay the additional money, they'll go back to the schools, it's for one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5003.669s">I</a> really don't think that's an imposition to brick and mortar businesses for the one day, the fact that it's a fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5012.838s">So</a> I would support this tonight, contingent upon approval by the school committee, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5019.404s">So</a> that would be my motion tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5044.961s">So</a> Mr. President, based on my recommendation then, if we approve it tonight, then it'll be up to the organizer to go before the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5053.444s">I</a> don't know when they meet next. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5054.564s">They</a> may have to have an emergency meeting or whatever to discuss this or approve it or whatever their protocols are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5061.467s">But</a> at least we're not standing in the way and at this point I feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5066.229s">moving</a> it forward, Mr. President, based on what I'm hearing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5071.012s">So</a> I would offer that as a motion that we approve it conditionally based on approval by the school committee for one day, February 10th from four to seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5082.279s">And</a> the setup begins at 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5085.781s">on</a> the Andrews School upon condition and approval by the school committee.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5156.416s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5158.671s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5159.652s">I</a> agree wholeheartedly with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5162.313s">And</a> right now we don't have any information to rely on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5166.716s">So</a> if this fundraiser turns out to be successful based on whatever the agreement was, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5174.141s">Then</a> next time they come before us, we'll make that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5177.883s">If</a> it turns out to be not a big money maker, then we'll make that determination as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5184.265s">This</a> is not a great fundraiser on behalf of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5187.847s">So</a> I think we need to see what happens and trial by fire, more or less.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_lQjJdcfTNfk/2024-11-19_lQjJdcfTNfk.html">City Council 01-19-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=138.842s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=140.473s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=141.613s">I</a> think this was an item that Councilor Knight mentioned a few weeks back during some of our discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=149.435s">This</a> is an issue, Mr. President, that deals with this pandemic, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=155.957s">This</a> hits to the very heart of trying to assist people that are in tough times right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=164.859s">And</a> back, I believe it was almost a year ago that the state legislature voted to allow cities and towns to waive interest and penalties on late property tax payments due to the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=181.173s">And</a> that relief expired actually in June of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=188.038s">And</a> I am asking that we take a vote as a council to ask our state delegation to once again implement this program that allows people that may be a little late on their property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=204.164s">to</a> not garner the 15% interest on their property tax payment, Mr. President, and penalties. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=213.27s">So</a> I would respectfully ask that we send this to our state delegation, asking that they renew the legislation that allowed cities and towns to waive the interest and penalties on late property tax payments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=228.64s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Locks.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1088.277s">Mr.</a> President, if we could send two council accommodations to these very fine offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1094.78s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1095.16s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1126.345s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1127.786s">This</a> issue was brought up last week by former councilor Bob Penter, who appeared before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1136.656s">He</a> asked that we put it on the agenda, so I sponsored it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1141.341s">This</a> is a little different than my first resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1144.063s">which</a> would give people the ability to waive interest and penalties if they're late on their property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1151.485s">This</a> would actually allow people to get a discount if they pay their property tax ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1160.128s">I</a> would respectfully ask, Mr. President, that this be laid on the table until our February 2nd meeting, because I am waiting on additional information regarding how this program <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1172.411s">could</a> potentially work, and some additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1175.733s">So</a> I would ask respectfully that it be laid on the table for two weeks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1496.58s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1497.52s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1499.508s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and like Councilor Falco mentioned, I remember those days where we used to get the budget 24 hours before we were asked to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1511.758s">And</a> as you know, it's a couple hundred page document that's very involved, and there's no way you can do your due diligence on behalf of the taxpayers of the community without having these pre-budgeted meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1525.048s">It</a> was last year that Councilor Falco <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1528.21s">I</a> think for the first time in a long time, asked that we meet in, I think it was February or March. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1533.672s">And</a> then we had COVID hit in March, and naturally that put a kind of a damper on the pre-budget meetings and pushed them down the line a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1542.474s">But</a> that is a magnificent idea, getting ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1547.076s">This</a> way we can discuss, as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, about using other tools in our tool belt. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1554.358s">So</a> if we do have a new system that we got an email today regarding C-Click Fix that the administration's been working on, use C-Click Fix to find out what the needs are in the community and base your budget on facts that are coming from C-Click Fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1571.018s">So</a> these are the things that we can use during the budget process, which have never, to be quite frank, have never been used in the past to make an informed decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1581.528s">And</a> by starting early, it'll give us the ability to sit down, not under a time clock that's ticking, ticking, ticking, but be able to sit down and methodically go through the budget and ask the questions on behalf of the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1594.54s">the</a> community so we can provide the services that they've come accustomed to, Mr. President, and enhance our services at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1602.522s">So</a> I want to thank Councilor Falco for his leadership on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1606.682s">We've</a> made several changes to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1608.603s">I</a> think, again, one of them was Councilor Falco's request to add the year over year and the projection and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1616.204s">And</a> that way you're not just looking at a budget line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1619.345s">We</a> can compare it to previous years and what's budgeted, and that's been a very helpful tool as one member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1626.092s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Falco for his input on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2088.976s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2090.417s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2091.618s">Just</a> if I can add, the pre-budget meetings are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2095.081s">I</a> would also add that we have our council priority list again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2099.644s">I</a> know we did one last year, in the previous year, but times have changed, things have changed, administrations have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2107.79s">And</a> I think it's important, Mr. President, that prior to going to a pre-budget meeting, that the council get together and deliberate on what we feel are council priorities, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2120.083s">And</a> I would ask that you include that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2122.725s">prior</a> to the pre-budget meeting so we can have those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2126.306s">And</a> maybe members can start jotting their issues of priorities right now so we can get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2132.829s">And</a> I think it's healthy to have the discussion, healthy to have the maybe disagreements, and move forward what we feel is a council priority on behalf of the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2145.774s">So</a> I would ask that that be part of the pre-budget deliberations as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2174.958s">And</a> I amended Mr. President for the Council priority.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2574.912s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I am thankful for Councilor Falco putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2580.073s">But</a> I also want to be mindful, Mr. President, that the intent of C-Click Fix was to supposedly have one-stop shopping, where you would go online and fill out a form and immediately someone would get back to you addressing your concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2595.756s">And</a> that has failed over the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2599.017s">And</a> I can personally account for that because the number of calls I receive on basic city services has gone up dramatically because of the fact that people don't have any confidence in see, click, fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2612.43s">I</a> would just state also, Mr. President, and I look forward to being trained on whatever system I have to be trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2618.256s">But</a> until I find out that this system is properly working, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2622.38s">I'm</a> not going to use it as a form or a method of communication with the department heads or the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2629.408s">When</a> someone reaches out to me, Mr. President, I can't tell them, I got to wait four weeks to get an answer, or the answer is I passed it off to another department head and then it was closed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2641.561s">So</a> in order for me to use the system, Mr. President, I have to make sure it gets results. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2647.149s">And</a> I'm going to wait until it's results based before I start using it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2652.297s">But</a> I am thankful that the city administration saw fit to <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2657.505s">I'd</a> like to know what updates were changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2662.007s">That</a> system is pretty basic to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2663.928s">I've</a> been on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2664.929s">I'm</a> not sure how you can change it other than behind the scenes to make sure the people that should be getting back to people get back in a timely fashion and close out items and follow through on items. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2676.375s">So</a> for that aspect, I hope that is being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2680.298s">in</a> addition to just updating the system itself, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2684.145s">The</a> system doesn't do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2685.888s">It's</a> the actual people behind the system that do the work and make sure residents get results. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2691.118s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3194.386s">President,</a> I'm not opposed to people attending meetings, but I think what the council is asking for is a financial update. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3201.77s">And</a> I'm not sure how this established working group is going to be able to add any insight into a financial update from another entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3211.896s">And</a> they have enough meetings, as Councilor Morell would probably attest to, already and enough on their plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3218.96s">I'm</a> not sure what good it would be to have them at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3223.062s">Again,</a> I'm not opposed to people coming to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3226.505s">They're</a> two completely different entities.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3712.592s">I</a> just would like to say, Mr. President, in my view of this, I think it's a disgrace, Mr. President, that Massachusetts is at the bottom of the list when it comes to vaccine distribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3724.18s">We</a> have the top hospitals in the world in Massachusetts, the top medical facilities, and we lag behind many other states <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3732.025s">Mr.</a> President, and the distribution of vaccines. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3735.206s">The</a> second point, Mr. President, I made this several weeks ago, is that we're vaccinating members of Congress that are in their 30s and 40s, Mr. President, with no comorbidities, but we can't vaccinate someone in their 70s and 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3749.109s">They</a> have to wait two months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3751.37s">It's</a> a disgrace what's going on in this state, Mr. President, and people should be well aware of who's handling this and why it's in the way we are, Mr. President, the shape we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3761.892s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3784.094s">Mr.</a> President, if that's the case, if that's the case, we go on record for everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3788.495s">We</a> should go on record sending a message, Mr. President, to our federal delegation stating how disappointed we are with the vaccination sites and the lack of vaccinations that have been distributed in this state. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3802.698s">So</a> we go on record on behalf of the seniors and most vulnerable people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3807.639s">Mr.</a> President, that's what we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3810.04s">I</a> would second that as an amendment.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4340.963s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4341.783s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on, um, you know, a true family man, Mr. McGillicuddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4348.407s">And,</a> uh, another fact about Mr. McGillicuddy for many years in this community, we would have not had local cable community access. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4356.592s">if</a> it wasn't for Mr. McGillicuddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4359.193s">He's</a> the one that was down there running the programs, making sure we had local programming, and was very instrumental in putting out community access for a number of years, among the many other things as Councilor Knight mentioned about his dedication and commitment to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4375.256s">I'll</a> miss seeing them both walking down the square hand in hand, Mr. President, but I wish his family and his wife <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4385.318s">well</a> in this grieving time, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4572.259s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4573.6s">And</a> if you can set the record straight, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4576.041s">This</a> was offered by myself and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4579.682s">And</a> that was my error, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4582.523s">Mystic</a> Valley Elder Services represents 11 communities, including Method, and offers one-stop support for older adults, adults living with disabilities, and their caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4595.486s">The</a> service includes transportation, nutrition, at-home care, health benefits counseling, health aging programs, protective services, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4612.782s">services</a> supports thousands of Method residents with programs such as Meals on Wheels and the Trip Metro North program, which provides free transportation to medical appointments, shopping, banking, visiting friends, and other activities for our seniors, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4630.436s">Karen</a> Rose was recently elected Vice President and has served on the board since 2011 in a number of capacities, such as the chair of the Board of Oversight, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4640.483s">and</a> Planning Committee, and a member of the Board's Executive Finance Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4645.306s">Karen</a> served with distinction, Mr. President, for 15 years as the Director of Medford's Public Health Department during difficult times, stepped up and held dual roles as Director of Responsibilities for five years as both Public Health Director and Elder Affairs Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4666.277s">I've</a> been doing this for a number of years, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4669.198s">And</a> I never like to rate people, but Karen was top notch. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4674.582s">She</a> truly is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4677.464s">Whatever</a> she did, she did to her fullest. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4680.026s">She</a> continues to do to her fullest. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4682.267s">She</a> gave this city everything as the head of <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4685.89s">public</a> health and elder affairs, two very difficult positions, as you can imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4691.791s">And</a> she ran them, let me tell you, with the utmost confidence, Mr. President, and not one of those programs ever slacked for a minute while Karen Rose was in charge, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4705.074s">You</a> know, you knew when Karen walked in the room, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4708.635s">She</a> was very assertive in what she said, but she was also, Mr. President, someone that had a lot of feelings and someone that really cared about people and really cared about what she did in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4722.878s">And</a> all too often, I think that gets lost in a lot of translation nowadays. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4728.339s">People</a> get more involved with the job and less about the people it impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4733.36s">And</a> truly, Karen would be out there during every vaccination for the flu shot, would be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4740.005s">The</a> director didn't have to be out there, Mr. President, but she cared about what was going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4745.95s">She</a> cared about the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4747.691s">You</a> couldn't have a day without seeing Karen at the senior center when they had their many programs over there, Mr. President, and the bingos and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4756.798s">I</a> don't know how she does. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4757.738s">She</a> must have had a twin because she divided herself equally <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4761.861s">Mr.</a> President, with two very taxing responsibilities in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4767.266s">And</a> I just want to congratulate her on her election to the Vice President of a very important organization that continues to assist thousands of Method residents in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4781.957s">And</a> I would like to send a citation to Karen congratulating her on behalf of her recent election. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4790.324s">And</a> also, Mr. President, for her 15 years commitment to the residents of this community, in particular to the seniors of this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4800.766s">And</a> I wish her well, Mr. President, in her future endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4804.167s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4804.587s">Councilor</a> Scott Belli.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4892.682s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4894.603s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marksley and Councilor Scott Kellogg for putting this on.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_u0KcLn7Rc-s/2024-11-19_u0KcLn7Rc-s.html">City Council 01-12-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=558.962s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=560.683s">Um,</a> and I want to thank my colleagues, vice president, um, night and Councilor Scarpelli, uh, for putting this on the agenda.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=592.917s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=593.758s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=593.958s">Cause</a> I think their letter refers to item 21-016. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=596.181s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=596.982s">Not</a> this paper, but I was curious, Mr. President, because as council vice president, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=605.692s">Knight</a> adequately stated that there has been a lot of change at Lawrence Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=611.656s">The</a> parking lot, the structure itself, signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=616.239s">However,</a> Mr. President, when they do come up before the council, I would hope they can answer a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=623.423s">I</a> received two calls from community advisory group members, which is the CAG group. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=631.148s">And</a> that was established to get direct abutters and area residents to give input to the hospital during this entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=640.695s">And</a> it's my understanding from talking to a few of the CAG members that it started out pretty good and the input was there from area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=652.603s">in</a> this CAG committee and then slowly but surely it started to dissipate and some of the members feel that they're not involved or at least advised on what's happening in the latest and greatest updates and they have some concern Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=672.038s">Also</a> this council voted unanimously on a couple of conditions <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=677.382s">uh,</a> just recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=679.164s">And</a> one of them was the icebox that's, um, on the top of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=685.289s">And,</a> um, it was stated at the time that, uh, due to, I guess, uh, the fire department's request that that icebox couldn't be contained with an outer wall and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=696.859s">And</a> I'm not disputing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=698.961s">Um,</a> that is a fire safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=702.003s">And,</a> uh, that was raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=703.665s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=704.746s">The</a> CAG was under the impression that the box itself would be <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=712.213s">uh,</a> a different, uh, aesthetically pleasing exterior would be put on the surrounding of this box. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=719.895s">And</a> I do agree when you go out, I, it does stick out. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=723.035s">I</a> know they try to do some painting and so forth, but the box definitely sticks out and it's not aesthetically pleasing to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=730.897s">So,</a> uh, I would ask once again, Mr. President, when they come up that, uh, that issue of the icebox be revisited. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=740.299s">on</a> behalf of not just this council, but the members of the CAG who have asked repeatedly that something be done with that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=749.701s">There</a> was also some concern about construction materials that are left in the parking lot, including heavy equipment that's been in the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=760.304s">And</a> if that equipment is no longer being utilized, and if the materials are no longer being utilized, residents would ask that <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=769.506s">construction</a> equipment and materials be moved in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=775.489s">So</a> I would just ask Mr. President when they do come before us that they open the lines of communication with the CAG group who is the eyes and ears of the community and this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=786.773s">And</a> if they feel slighted, Mr. President, that doesn't speak well for what's taking place and the oversight that the neighborhood and director butters should have regarding this entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=798.7s">So</a> I just want to put that out there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=801.261s">Uh,</a> the facility does, in my opinion, uh, I'm very pleased with how it generally looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=807.605s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=808.085s">The</a> configuration of the lot I think will be workable. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=812.168s">Some</a> of the signage that has been put out there I think will assist with safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=818.092s">The</a> other issue that was not addressed, Mr. President, is the issue that was brought up by many members of this council was the ADA access. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=826.758s">And</a> I know we requested that our ADA monitor in the city review ADA access within that facility and that a study be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=835.322s">And</a> I would ask that part of this paper, if my colleagues would indulge me, that we send this back to the city administration because that was a condition that was laid on the approval of the ambulatory care center. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=850.229s">So</a> I would ask that that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=853.97s">ADA</a> access, an update on that report, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=859.754s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=871.122s">I</a> think that's what Councilor Knight has requested, so I would agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=877.466s">But</a> I want to make sure, Mr. President, that they have a week to discuss the issues of the lack of communication, the icebox, and the equipment that's on the lot, as well as the ADA issues that were brought up during the conditions approval.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1202.188s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1204.271s">Paper</a> 20-625 was offered by myself several weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1209.917s">It</a> was regarding having an on-site committee of the whole meeting at Fulton Spring Road, which we did on Saturday, November 21st at 11 AM. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1222.611s">Every</a> member of the council was present along with the mayor, DPW commissioner, and traffic engineer, and the city engineer, as well as a number of residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1240.099s">And</a> there were a number of issues discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1242.24s">The</a> council offered a number of recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1245.822s">be</a> sent to the Traffic Commission and the City Administration, of which some were done pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1254.028s">There</a> was striping done at some of the intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1257.75s">Just</a> recently at the top of Vista Rav, where there was concern about a rotary at the top of Vista Rav, that was highlighted by some markings and signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1269.719s">So</a> there was some <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1272.021s">positive</a> moves made from this meeting that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1276.303s">However,</a> Mr. President, there was also a recommendation made by myself that we reconvene two weeks after the November 21st meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1286.707s">And</a> we have yet to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1288.388s">I</a> understand it was Christmas and New Year's and it was a <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1292.85s">very</a> difficult time to get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1295.332s">However,</a> I wanted to make sure that we did not drop the ball on this, and that's why I'm offering tonight that we find out where we stand on a number of the recommendations that were made, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1309.444s">One</a> in particular, which residents keep calling me on, is the fact that one of the recommendations that was made was put forth by myself and offered by myself and a resident, Mr. Bailey. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1325.568s">We</a> asked, and it was approved by this council, that we erect limit access signs at Fell's Ave, Marley Hill Road, Fulton Spring Road, Terrace Road, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1336.75s">and</a> Grover Road in the morning and afternoon peak hours in both directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1343.396s">And</a> that was a key point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1346.799s">It</a> was great that we were able to put some signage up and we were able to paint some markings. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1351.763s">some</a> crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1353.324s">However,</a> the issue that I'm hearing still from residents is the speeding cut through traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1359.387s">If</a> you were to rate it on a scale of one to 10, to me, that issue is the 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1365.251s">That</a> is the most important issue that I'm hearing from residents in the area, that the speeding cut through traffic is of utmost concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1374.316s">So</a> I ask once again, Mr. President, and this was voted <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1377.37s">unanimously</a> by the Medford City Council at that Committee of the Whole on the 21st, that once again, we direct this back to the city and to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1390.602s">the</a> traffic commission requesting that resident only limit access signs be placed at Falzav, Murray Hill Road, Fulton Spring Road, Terrace Road, and Grover Road in the interest of public safety during peak morning and afternoon hours in both directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1411.162s">And</a> this is not a first, this has been done in many sections of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1417.464s">Enforcement</a> is very important as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1420.285s">You</a> can put up all the signage, but it's important that we also ask that increased enforcement coupled with these signs take place in that area to help ease concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1432.448s">I</a> just want to read off a few, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1435.031s">I</a> went through the committee report, and it's been a month and a half now. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1439.556s">But</a> I think it's important to remember what's being done currently with some of the striping and signage, and what the request was of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1449.487s">Because</a> all too often, we bring things up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1452.794s">And</a> they get forgotten about. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1454.796s">And</a> I want to make sure that this council, and I know we will stay on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1460.022s">So</a> speeding and consistent police presence with cut through traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1468.03s">was</a> a concern that was raised over and over again according to the committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1474.055s">That</a> we suppress certain streets from the Waze app. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1478.038s">And</a> I believe it was mentioned by the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, that they only do it regarding construction purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1489.99s">And</a> I'd like to get more involved and see what we can do, because this is clearly not a construction purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1498.654s">This</a> is a public safety purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1500.775s">And</a> I think that would trump construction work with ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1506.118s">So</a> I'm not quite sure why. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1508.56s">public</a> safety would take a backseat. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1511.324s">So</a> I think we need that looked at again. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1515.089s">Difficulty</a> getting out of the driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1517.352s">I</a> think if we are able to stop this cut through traffic, I think that'll solve some of the concerns with residents getting out of their driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1524.722s">I</a> don't have to tell Councilor Falco about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1527.806s">He</a> deals with it on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1530.669s">The</a> radar feedback signs installed in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1535.474s">Residents</a> were looking for additional radar feedback signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1540.239s">As</a> I mentioned, more police presence. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1542.221s">Concerns</a> on parking on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1544.844s">And</a> that still takes place up in many sections of the city, in particular in the heights, because of some of the narrow streets and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1552.228s">There's</a> a lot of sidewalk parking, which poses a concern for residents that may have to go into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1558.172s">And</a> that's a public safety concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1561.114s">Stop</a> signs at Rockland Road and Fels Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1564.196s">I</a> know there were a number of residents there that were pushing that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1568.998s">And</a> the confusion about the rotary at the top of Vista Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1573.861s">from</a> what I hear has now been somewhat resolved with additional markings and a sign that was put at that rotary to better define the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1584.686s">And</a> I want to thank the DPW and Todd Blake for moving forward in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1588.788s">So</a> I would hope Mr. President that this council stays on top of this issue and that we receive through my motion tonight requesting that the <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1599.073s">traffic</a> commission and the city administration look at the limited access signs on the roads that I mentioned already that we stay on top of this very important issue.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1719.757s">Are</a> you asking for an onsite meeting or just?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1917.625s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1920.127s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1921.388s">Um,</a> while we have this, uh, meeting that I appreciate council Falco calling for, um, also, and I brought this up in the past to 40 Salem street, uh, the building apartment building that was put up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1935.758s">uh,</a> there were several promises made, uh, to area residents that live on, uh, Everett and, uh, Connors, Everett and Salem, uh, regarding curbing, uh, on the street, sidewalk, uh, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1949.981s">And</a> I think it's important, Mr. President, that these promises when they met with the neighborhood, when the development met back some year and a half ago and promised X, Y, and Z that we follow through, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1961.144s">So</a> I would ask that 240, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1962.924s">Salem</a> Street be added to the conversations when we discuss these other issues as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2021.504s">I</a> want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Scarpelli, for co-offering this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2028.69s">We</a> both received, and I'm sure members of the council also received, a number of phone calls over the last week and a half with a number of new signs that have been popping up on Lawrence Road, Governor's Ave, and Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2043.262s">Many</a> residents saw some spray painting on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2047.425s">to</a> indicate maybe some utility work or possible signage going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2053.389s">But</a> they were never notified or didn't know what was going to happen in front of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2058.792s">Just</a> recently, Mr. President, the city, in conjunction with Lawrence Memorial Hospital, entered into an agreement based on a traffic study that was done by Lawrence Memorial Hospital and also a traffic study that was done by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2074.962s">regarding</a> traffic calming initiatives with the new ambulatory care center that's going at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2082.645s">So</a> some additional signage was recommended, which I support 1,000%. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2087.227s">I</a> just want to let that be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2090.688s">Some</a> of the signs that went up, in particular, these radar traffic signs that went up didn't make any sense, the placement of the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2101.612s">The</a> one on Lawrence Road, which was coming around the bend from Forest Street, was about maybe 200 feet into Lawrence Road, right before a speed hump. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2116.019s">It</a> just made zero sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2119.0s">And</a> after a few phone calls, I know Councilor Scarpelli and I'm sure other members of the council made some phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2125.463s">to</a> the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, and had a discussion with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2130.965s">They</a> looked into the four signs that were put up at the recommendation of this traffic study, but the launch board hired a vendor that put these signs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2141.747s">Come</a> to find out all four signs were put <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2144.288s">in</a> the wrong space, in the wrong area, some not even remotely close to where they should have been placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2152.176s">Needless</a> to say, right away, I have to say, the city got on top of it, and they reached out to Lawrence, and Lawrence reached out to their vendor, and these signs were moved within a matter of a day or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2164.547s">And</a> I want to thank them for that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2167.289s">In</a> addition to the additional signage, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2170.893s">residents</a> were concerned about the number of signs, the excessive number of signs on the roads in their particular neighborhood, turning some areas, some stretches, into what would look like Route 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2186.293s">That</a> many signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2187.715s">So</a> I went down to Lawrence Road, the stretch from Forest Street to Governor's Ave, and I counted a total on both sides, a total of, and that small stretch, it's probably five to 600 feet from Forest to Governor's Ave on Lawrence Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2206.78s">I</a> counted 14 signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2211.096s">Some</a> signs are needed, they're necessary, but there were some signs that were excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2216.499s">I</a> think to have two signs notifying residents on each side, or drivers on each side of the street, that there's a speed hump, I think is excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2228.425s">And</a> there's not there's not one on Winthrop Street for the speed hump to signs notifying It just seems excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2235.171s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2236.232s">There's</a> some outdated signage that still exists regarding a school that we used to have at the top of the Fulton school and not the Fulton school on the top of governor's <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2249.464s">Forest</a> Park at the top of Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2253.148s">There's</a> still signage on Lawrence Road for crossing students and you could tell these signs are from the 60s and 70s and there's no crosswalk there anymore there's just signs and <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2269.683s">We</a> received the correspondence from the city that DPW just recently removed some of this excessive signage that's around, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2279.128s">And</a> I ask that they keep on removing some of the excessive signage around the community that's not needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2286.512s">Sometimes</a> when you have a plethora of signs, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2289.648s">you</a> might as well not put up any at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2291.689s">Because</a> one after another, after another, is gonna do nothing to reduce speed, to make people aware of what's gonna happen, to make crossing safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2300.193s">It's</a> gonna do absolutely nothing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2302.454s">It's</a> just gonna be a blur of signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2304.795s">And</a> I think that's what we're seeing in certain stretches. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2307.836s">So</a> again, I wanna thank Councilor Scarpelli, I know he has a lot to say on this too, for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2313.298s">And</a> I wanna thank the city administration and Lawrence Memorial Hospital for their quick action on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2591.794s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2592.735s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2593.776s">Uh,</a> just if I could, before you call the roll, uh, cause Councilor Scarpelli just jogged my, my memory on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2599.821s">The,</a> uh, the raised speed bump, he's thousand percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2605.046s">It</a> blends in with the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2606.367s">It's</a> actually hot top.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2608.629s">And</a> it's such a slight raise, and I'm sure it's done according to whatever the engineering specs are, but it's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2617.039s">I</a> know there's signage indicating there's a speed hump, but it's very difficult to know that it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2623.247s">And</a> the intent is not to sneak up on people and say, ha ha, we got you on a speed hump. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2628.813s">It's</a> to let people know that it's there so they can slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2632.175s">And</a> after standing out there for a good 15 to 20 minutes, when I was walking with one of the residents, we didn't see many tail lights, you know, brake lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2641.719s">Everyone</a> was just going right over it, like it didn't exist, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2646.361s">And</a> I think it would be helpful, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, to maybe have a directional white arrow or something that delineates the edges <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2655.605s">like</a> we do up on Winthrop Street, that shows that there's a raised hump, a speed hump, whatever you want to call it, that exists there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2664.389s">And</a> I think that will go a long way for residents to slow down when they see something, an impediment in the road, rather than just, it looks like there's nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2675.194s">And</a> really, I've done it myself actually, going over it, and you don't realize it until you're on the top of it and say, geez, I just hit this thing again. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2683.758s">And</a> that's not the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2684.759s">The</a> intent is to slow down ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2686.9s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2687.62s">So</a> I would ask if we can make a part of the committee report that, um, that we send this, uh, to the, uh, Todd Blake and ask them that they paint or put some design on it or something to make it more noticeable.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2757.678s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2758.898s">And</a> this is really, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2761.212s">Follow</a> up, back in 2017, as my resolution alluded to, this method city council at the recommendation of the city administration at the time and the water sewer commissioners asked for the council to vote on a proposed baseline charge for water and sewer services. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2781.821s">And</a> the explanation that we received at the time was to assist with stabilizing the water and sewer budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2790.425s">One</a> could debate that until the cows come home because we, for many years, have looked at a $5 to $6 million surplus in the water and sewer enterprise accounts, which would indicate to me that we are overcharging water and sewer rate payers in order to have a slush fund available. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2810.611s">So</a> that the issue of stabilizing the budget could be debated. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2816.313s">However,</a> Mr. President, the base rate at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2819.994s">which</a> was implemented was based on your meter size. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2824.617s">And</a> most residential homeowners have the same meter size. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2829.12s">It's</a> the size water pipe that's coming into your home that indicates the $8.61 base rate that you pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2838.685s">Commercial</a> would have a larger water pipe coming in, and they would pay a higher rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2843.968s">So</a> the vast majority of residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2846.749s">We're</a> paying the $8.61. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2848.67s">The</a> charge was a bimonthly charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2852.471s">So</a> if you do the math, the 861 times 6 would bring you to an annual $51.66 that this base rate was charging residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2867.354s">I</a> still have not yet to receive any answer other than stabilizing a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2873.796s">What</a> residents get for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2876.216s">additional</a> tax, I would call it a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2880.88s">And</a> I think it's important, Mr. President, that we receive an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2884.563s">This</a> has been three years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2886.944s">Indeed,</a> has this been successful in stabilizing the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2891.428s">If</a> so, I'd like that explained to me by the city administration, by the finance director, the water and sewer commissioners, and also the questions that were asked, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2902.176s">about</a> a breakdown of where the funds go. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2904.498s">I</a> believe it's very vital if the funds are co-mingled with the Water and Sewer Enterprise account money, we should know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2911.984s">If</a> not, if they're held in a separate account, is that account used to offset projects that are happening in the community, leak detection, INI, and a breakdown by commercial versus residential fees that are collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2931.757s">I</a> think that about covers it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2934.879s">Tonight</a> we have a very distinguished Method resident that would like to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2941.302s">A</a> former colleague of ours who served on this council with distinction for three decades, over three decades, is here tonight to speak on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2953.669s">So</a> I had asked that my former colleague, Councilor Penta, be able to speak on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2959.632s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3638.908s">On</a> the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3639.669s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3643.05s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3643.891s">I</a> want to thank my colleague Councilor Penta for his presentation tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3648.873s">Um,</a> you know, uh, the resolution was regarding the base fee charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3653.956s">Uh,</a> but I think Councilor Penta brings up some very interesting points, Mr. President, regarding these additional charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3661.299s">And</a> it's not just one item, it's a number of items that exist within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3666.481s">And</a> at some point, I think as a council, when we're talking about people not being able to afford their rent or their mortgage, and people living from paycheck to paycheck, and a pandemic, I think we have to look at everything that may be available to help relieve <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3684.168s">uh,</a> the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3687.109s">And,</a> uh, he brings up some very valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3690.01s">Um,</a> since I've been on the council, I've offered at least three resolutions, uh, to do away with the acts of 1982. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3697.393s">I</a> don't know if my colleagues, uh, haven't done a number of years now cause it kind of fell on deaf ears for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3705.355s">But</a> the acts of 1982, the city council voted by home rule petition to allow the city to get up to 5% <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3713.658s">of</a> a franchise fee on the cable bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3717.242s">That's</a> the highest you can get. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3719.524s">And</a> I'm not opposed to using franchise fees to run the operation of community access, the educational channel, the government channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3729.655s">However,</a> out of the 5%, only 2% of the money goes to operate those three channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3737.543s">3%</a> because of this act of 1982 goes back into the city coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3742.606s">And</a> it's nothing more than another hidden tax in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3747.789s">And</a> that 3% is about $360,000 a year that goes back into the city coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3755.094s">Some</a> would say, that's great, the money's going back into the city coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3758.616s">Other</a> would say, you know what, that's not what this money was intended. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3762.659s">The</a> purpose was to run local access, local cable, community access, governmental channel, and not to fund the city budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3772.864s">So</a> Council Penta brings up, that's just one issue, a number of issues that I think we as a council need to take a look at and address in these tough times. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3782.61s">And</a> they're not going to get better quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3785.931s">And</a> any way we can save the rate payers some additional funds, I think we need to look at it, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=1031.535s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=1036.757s">Motion</a> for approval.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2553.905s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2554.666s">I</a> want to thank Marianne and her staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2557.96s">It</a> has been a trying time. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2559.961s">And</a> I want to thank, Mr. President, the residents of this community who have been dealing with this for 10 months and have, I think, done a tremendous job, Mr. President, in social distancing and watching out for their neighbors, watching out for people with comorbidities, and trying to do the best they can for their families and themselves in this trying time. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2581.447s">So</a> I think they deserve a round of applause as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2585.668s">Marianne,</a> any idea how many vaccines we're going to get in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2589.771s">Yeah,</a> not specificity yet.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2611.147s">Phase</a> 1B.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2659.211s">So,</a> Marianne, when you say phase one, is the city of Medford involved with the distribution of vaccinations in phase one for police, fire, and first line responders?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2686.843s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2687.684s">So</a> every first responder in the city of Medford will be guaranteed <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2692.193s">that</a> the city of Medford will have their vaccine? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2696.896s">Or</a> when you say regional, I kind of get lost because I'm not sure who's the direct responsibility when it comes to regional.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2743.974s">So</a> Mary Ann, what is the total number of our police and fire personnel?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2765.097s">Okay,</a> so now we're talking two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2768.798s">Willing</a> to take and the number of first line responders that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2774.02s">Because</a> we have over 200 in my last count during budgeting of police and fire.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2799.792s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2800.292s">So</a> why wouldn't we go to whoever is distributing this and say, we need 200 vaccines for our police and fire?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2816.037s">And</a> if that number changes, if I said, no, I don't want to do it, then I decide to do it, is it a quick turnaround to get the vaccine?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2828.884s">OK,</a> that makes zero sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2831.125s">If</a> we have the 200 requirement, that we wouldn't just get 200 vaccines.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2841.828s">Right,</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2843.068s">But</a> then when you start looking at first line responders, there's EMS. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2848.11s">You</a> have, in my opinion, phase 2 with seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2853.772s">Any</a> idea when phase 2 is going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2856.273s">February.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2857.568s">In</a> February? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2858.749s">That's</a> what we're being told. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2861.11s">Do</a> we know mid-February, late February?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2868.194s">February</a> to March. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2869.815s">So</a> it's another two months before.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2888.803s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2889.803s">So,</a> seniors that currently get the flu vaccination by the city, is it going to be the same process and setup? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2898.125s">I</a> hope so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2926.22s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2927.821s">And</a> how do we know the numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2930.944s">Naturally,</a> you're not going to be able to check with every senior that may want the vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=2934.767s">So</a> how will you order the vaccines for our phase two senior population?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3006.341s">And</a> as far as you know, and I appreciate you answering all these questions, I realize this is a moving target. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3014.084s">So</a> as far as you know, in order to obtain a vaccination, you have to go on the state website, expression right now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3024.409s">I'm</a> just trying to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3026.75s">Cause</a> I'm getting, I'm fielding a lot of questions from seniors asking when the city will get everybody wants to know.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3083.144s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3083.884s">I</a> guess if you're in Congress, you overstep all these phases, and you can get your shot right away, because we know how essential people in Congress are. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3093.252s">And</a> they can get their shot immediately.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3099.35s">What</a> health people are not in phase one? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3101.191s">They're</a> not in phase one. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3102.152s">Okay,</a> well, maybe you have to run for Congress to get your shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3107.736s">So,</a> and I realize, you know, you don't have all the answers now, but I really am curious how this is going to roll out in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3117.462s">And</a> we're partnering with the state, and right there, I don't have a lot of confidence in how the state operates, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3126.205s">So</a> that worries me a little bit, the fact that the only option may be at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3133.927s">to</a> have someone go on the internet and pull out an application, and knowing that there's a fair number of people that don't have internet access, a fair number of people that may not have the whereabouts to do that, and I'm wondering what process we're going to set up, and this may be too early for you now, but I'm sure these discussions should be had right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3154.099s">Yeah,</a> we're in those discussions, and we will.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3196.585s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3197.605s">I</a> just want to make sure that when the time comes that we're not sitting here saying, well, I wish we had enough vaccinations because we didn't realize that this many people wanted the vaccination. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3209.991s">And</a> I just want to make sure that's well thought out before we enter that phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3214.713s">And</a> I want to make sure we hit all segments of our population. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3218.335s">So</a> not just the elite, <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3220.296s">that</a> are up in Congress or have the, where the means to get their vaccination before anyone else, before anyone else, you know, get their fair share as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3274.559s">And</a> I don't doubt that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3276.3s">And</a> my last question is, what percent of the testing that currently happens in Method consists of Tufts testing?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3302.446s">Were</a> Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3303.906s">So</a> I don't want to speak out of turn, but it's clear to say if the Tufts testing dwindles, that Medford's going to find itself in the red pretty quickly.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3315.412s">You</a> said you think so?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3317.874s">Yeah,</a> I believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3319.034s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3319.695s">I</a> would think so, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3321.275s">And</a> we all know, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3324.077s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3325.014s">And</a> I don't think that should alarm anyone, but I think it's important to know because as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, you know, we went from being the yellow to the red back to the yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3336.38s">Now</a> we've been in the yellow for quite some time or the green or whatever color we've been in. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3340.942s">We</a> haven't reached that red point and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3345.124s">merely</a> because of the testing, as Councilor Morell mentioned too, for Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3350.325s">And</a> that's going to be very interesting to see what those numbers will be like once that, once that testing goes down, but I appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=3359.387s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4312.069s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I'd be remiss if I didn't say anything about Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4317.751s">Patrick's</a> been on board several years now, Mr. President, and let me tell you, the change in this community regarding PEG access, which is the public educational and government channel, <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4332.157s">has</a> been tremendous over the last several years since Patrick came on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4336.34s">I</a> remember a day when we used to go in the side room, Mr. President, and have some meetings, committee hall meetings and subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4346.888s">And</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4347.769s">That</a> side room now, it's all televised. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4350.971s">It's</a> all open for the public, it's all transparent, and that is largely due to the efforts of Patrick Gordon and the expertise that he brought, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4362.468s">And</a> I agree with my colleagues over the last 10 months, Patrick was the first to step up. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4368.015s">and</a> make sure that this council had a forum, make sure that we had access to Zoom, make sure that it was compatible to our equipment here, and he's done yeoman's work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4380.078s">There's</a> a movement in Congress to do away with PEG access. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4387.009s">And</a> I think it would be one of the worst things to do, Mr. President, in order to stifle open dialogue, stifle participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4399.758s">And</a> I hope it goes nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4401.76s">But</a> I know there's a movement afoot because of the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4405.682s">But</a> the cost to me, the transparency <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4411.106s">And</a> public input far outweighs any cost, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4415.408s">And</a> that's what good government's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4417.79s">And</a> we truly have a winner in Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4421.852s">And</a> I think Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, it's a staff of one person, one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4430.796s">When</a> Patrick has to say, hey, can you do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4433.077s">He</a> has to look in the mirror, because he's telling himself to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4437.447s">There's</a> no one else in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4439.588s">It's</a> amazing what this gentleman puts out for a one-person office. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4443.629s">Go</a> to Somerville, go to Malden, go to Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4447.991s">They</a> have a full-fledged department with multiple people. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4454.293s">And</a> here he is pulling it off with one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4456.614s">I</a> want to thank him. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4457.614s">It's</a> well-warranted, Mr. President, and Patrick, keep up the good work.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4969.502s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4970.403s">I</a> want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4975.55s">My</a> question to the Chief of Staff is, what would it take to put together a monthly warrant articles for this council?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5007.075s">So</a> this is a doable request then? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5009.917s">For</a> sure, yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5011.969s">So</a> do we, and I appreciate what Councilor Knight is offering, but do we have to go through the process of creating an ordinance in order to get this reporting? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5023.934s">Or</a> is this something we can receive a commitment that this will be a monthly report going forward that we will receive from the administration?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5044.976s">I'm</a> not opposed to putting together an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5047.738s">I</a> think that would be a last resort in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5050.58s">I</a> think there should be that mutual respect among the legislative and the executive branch when we request information. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5058.826s">I</a> appreciate my colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5061.328s">frustration</a> with not receiving things in a timely fashion, especially when it comes to financial reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5069.192s">I</a> know other communities, they meet constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5072.214s">They</a> have working groups that meet and go over warrant articles and so forth and see where the spending is and make recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5079.738s">And</a> as far as I know, that's really never happened with this council and I can appreciate this fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5087.021s">that</a> this is something that we should be receiving going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5090.424s">So,</a> you know, I'll support this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5093.266s">I</a> hope there's no need to draft an ordinance and so forth, but if that's the druthers of this council, I will support that as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5557.931s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5558.771s">I</a> think my colleague, Councilor Knight, made a great explanation of what this is trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5565.794s">And</a> many of the crucial pieces of legislation that we put forth require three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5573.017s">And</a> I think what Councilor Knight is getting at, a public hearing is really no difference than any other important document we work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5580.962s">And</a> what happens in a city ordinance, the first reading is what appears on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5588.027s">So</a> a public hearing appears on the agenda for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5591.469s">The</a> difference between the public hearing and the three readings is the three readings then require you to put notice in the newspaper, then require you to come back for a third reading for final approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5603.441s">None</a> of that takes place during a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5605.401s">So</a> my colleagues write. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5607.002s">What</a> typically happens is we'll listen, we'll hear both sides, and then typically act. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5612.343s">So</a> I agree with 90% of this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5615.683s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5617.624s">The</a> six-day calendar day, I think we can debate about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5621.664s">But</a> there has to be a grace period, which allows for public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5625.505s">And</a> I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5626.645s">Public</a> comments can also be put forth ahead of time <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5630.846s">However,</a> if you're not aware of what the petition is going after until that meeting happens, then how do you make a comment on something you're not aware of? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5638.357s">And</a> there may not be enough information that's presented on the council agenda or so forth to make an informed decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5645.748s">So</a> I have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5647.65s">And</a> I think the section five, which gives us the option, sometimes we may have a public hearing that we want that vote that night, because it's an issue of utmost importance, public safety, whatever it might be, and we want to act quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5663.183s">And</a> this gives us an option to act quickly by a majority vote of the council if we deem necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5669.368s">So</a> I like 90% of this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5671.99s">I</a> would ask that it be sent to, I concur with. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5677.154s">rules</a> with Council Vice President Caraviello.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5901.652s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5902.692s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and Councilor Bears is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5906.915s">This</a> paper was referred to, paper 20-302, was referred to the subcommittee on the elderly and housing affairs on April 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5916.842s">The</a> paper read, it was offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the mayor and Board of Health implement an emergency order to require that no landlord <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5926.309s">and</a> or owner shall enforce an eviction upon a resident of Medford, residential or commercial, during the public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5935.894s">We</a> did have a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5937.394s">I</a> was shown April 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5938.915s">I</a> might be off on the days. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5940.836s">I</a> know Councilor Beall said the 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5942.457s">But</a> sometime at the end of April, we did have a public meeting on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5947.799s">There</a> were a number of people who attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5949.44s">I</a> know myself and Vice President Caraviello, I believe, is on the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5955.341s">We</a> actually voted on sending out to the city solicitor to draft an ordinance, Mr. President, and to provide us some assistance regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5972.457s">The</a> Housing Stability Task Force, that was passed 3-0 by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5978.942s">I</a> have yet to see any response regarding that ordinance as part of paper 20-300, which I believe was offered by Councilor Bears.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5996.13s">That</a> was to give guidance and other assistance for Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6001.112s">So</a> I've yet to see any action on that paper as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6004.814s">But</a> as far as I know, paper 20-302 was left in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6009.356s">And</a> part of it was because the state was working on their eviction moratorium and their program. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6016.879s">But</a> that doesn't mean this can't be resurrected, and I think that would be the appropriate direction to go rather than just create multiple papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6027.444s">This</a> is very similar subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6030.005s">I</a> would recommend that the chair set up an elderly and housing affairs subcommittee and discuss the paper that's currently before us, which is in line with, I believe, is being offered this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6043.632s">And</a> move in that direction, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6047.136s">So</a> that's what I would recommend tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6049.478s">I</a> agree with your ruling as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6052.461s">These</a> are very similar in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6054.664s">And</a> we're already dealing with the paper currently before subcommittee, and that could be called at any particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6061.611s">Also,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6063.632s">Just</a> so people are aware, there are a number of great programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6066.813s">I</a> work for the Department of Housing and the rapid rehousing programs with raft, home base, there's an influx of money, transitional assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6077.957s">The</a> city council voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6079.517s">to</a> use community preservation money for the rental assistance program. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6083.639s">And</a> we just got a report on that several weeks back, how Medford residents are taking advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6089.042s">I</a> realize this is not a solve-all, but there are a number of programs out there to assist, Mr. President, and help residents that are the most needy in our community stay within their housing right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6102.99s">So</a> if people aren't aware of that, and that's why I thought the housing stability hotline <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6108.873s">I</a> thought that was a magnificent idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6111.596s">But</a> it's been eight months and for the past eight months people could have been using that hotline in order to make these phone calls and find out what may be available out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6121.667s">So</a> I think we did miss a little bit of an opportunity to try to implement this. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6126.292s">I</a> realize if this council <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6127.974s">passes</a> that forward, it still has to be implemented by the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6132.257s">So</a> I'm not saying that we have the ability to single handedly do this, but I think there was some low lying fruit with the housing stability task force and the hotline that the subcommittee could have worked on in the past eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6146.185s">And</a> I'm hoping the chair calls for a meeting very shortly.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6902.213s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6904.414s">Yes,</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6905.854s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6907.234s">During</a> our last Wednesday's meeting regarding this particular, the Committee of the Whole, these particular items, there were, I believe, one or two recommendations made. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6918.637s">So</a> I would ask that the recommendations made by the Committee of the Whole follow the approval of this paper, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7815.087s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7816.248s">And</a> I agree with a lot of the speakers that this is an emergency issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7821.832s">And</a> this particular resolution is asking for the administration to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7827.917s">So</a> I think people should be picking up the phone, sending emails, contacting the mayor's office, because this seems like a roundabout way to get something done that's an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7839.507s">So</a> I would urge people, like I'll do tomorrow, pick up the phone and call the administration, Mr. President, and have them implement it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7847.35s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7878.837s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7879.618s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7880.939s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7882.841s">So</a> a very similar paper has been in subcommittee for eight months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7887.865s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7888.766s">Eight</a> months. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7890.007s">The</a> moratorium ended, I believe, on October 18th in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7894.591s">I</a> may be off on that, but I thought I read on October 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7898.515s">So</a> it's been two months, Mr. President, that the subcommittee could have met. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7902.779s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7902.939s">Two</a> months.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7904.06s">We</a> met when the paper was sent to subcommittee on April 7th, and we met on subcommittee two weeks later. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7911.67s">That's</a> how quickly it happened, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7913.832s">We</a> met on April 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7915.935s">So</a> if this was an emergency, Mr. President, on October 18th, we should have had a meeting the following week. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7922.597s">I</a> would agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7923.178s">To</a> go over the paper that was in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7925.72s">I'm</a> not saying it's not an emergency, Mr. President, but I just think this is a real roundabout way of getting something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7933.388s">And</a> if people truly want to get something done, then let's act, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7937.211s">As</a> I mentioned earlier, we got the housing stability hotline that we mentioned eight months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7942.997s">Eight</a> months ago, that would be a real use in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7946.458s">We</a> mentioned about the Housing Stability Task Force, another real use. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7950.48s">And</a> we heard from one of the speakers that hasn't met since May, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7954.782s">So</a> we're missing a lot of opportunity to move forward on items, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7959.224s">And</a> I think some people are spinning their wheels in the wrong direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7963.145s">So</a> I'm more than happy, Mr. President, to move issues forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7966.707s">But</a> we have to do it in a way that makes sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7969.488s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7995.533s">Eight</a> months. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7996.413s">So</a> if we want to look to see where maybe something didn't get followed through, it's with that paper and those issues that were before the subcommittee, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8006.659s">Because</a> even if the moratorium was on place, you could still work at some point, it's going to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8011.802s">And</a> you could still work to that end point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8014.983s">And</a> that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8016.064s">There</a> was no planning, no follow-up meetings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8019.625s">And</a> maybe that's where the ball was dropped.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8035.31s">Well,</a> you should have been yelling from the highest mountain if that hasn't happened in eight months, because this is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8041.568s">Mr.</a> Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8042.929s">Mr.</a> President, I work with homeless families on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8045.851s">I</a> know you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8046.411s">On</a> a daily basis, trying to get homeless families and homeless individuals into permanent housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8052.555s">So</a> I know what the need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8053.836s">I</a> know what the demand is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8056.838s">So</a> I see it on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8059.76s">If</a> this is an emergency, we should have acted over the last eight months, Mr. President, and it is an emergency.

href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=846.177s">Brian</a> is a Mustang and has Mustang pride embedded in his DNA. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=853.418s">He</a> has, as we refer to, blue and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=855.799s">Anyone</a> that has played sports for Medford High School or volunteered for the sport program, in my opinion, have blue and white that runs through their veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=866.581s">And</a> Brian is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=868.241s">He</a> bleeds blue and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=870.162s">And</a> as a <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=871.882s">member</a> of the Hall of Fame, which I can't say I've ever been inducted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=878.126s">It's</a> a big privilege to be a member of the Hall of Fame. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=881.828s">And</a> Brian truly is that person that deserves the honor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=887.892s">He</a> volunteered every Saturday for 20 years to help student athletes at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=895.337s">20</a> years of a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=897.398s">never</a> once looked for any recognition, never once waved a banner and said, look what I'm doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=903.104s">Everything</a> was behind the scenes, and he did it to help student athletes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=907.207s">And</a> again, that speaks volumes about a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=911.031s">He's</a> a current and active baseball umpire. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=915.115s">And</a> he loves the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=917.496s">He</a> likes to be around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=918.937s">He</a> likes the camaraderie. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=920.158s">He</a> likes dealing with the athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=923.82s">And</a> he's a fair man as I think anyone would speak when they mention his name. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=929.704s">He</a> was involved for many years and still is with Medford High baseball and the football programs as the equipment manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=938.149s">And</a> that's a tough job. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=939.19s">Don't</a> think for a second that's not a tough job. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=942.191s">And</a> the stats manager, which is equally a tough job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=948.034s">Brian</a> is involved with the coaches versus cancer yearly charity fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=953.877s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=955.037s">It's</a> an event that's part of the American Cancer Society, and it spotlights cancer awareness through the playing of our national pastime to raise money, in which it raised tens of thousands of dollars for cancer, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=973.401s">And</a> Brian has been part of that over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=977.182s">Brian</a> also played senior Babe Ruth baseball for the Medford Rotary Colts, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=983.203s">And</a> he helped coach Method's Mega Club, which is a long established club in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=991.085s">And</a> I think it's only fitting, Mr. President, to find someone that has such a commitment to this community and dedication, unselfishness, and reward them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1005.508s">So</a> I would respectfully ask my colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1008.048s">That</a> we send, we don't want to vote on it tonight, we can vote on it next week because this was offered under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1014.971s">But</a> where it's a congratulatory thing, Mr. President, I think it would be acceptable voting on it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1021.755s">I</a> would respectfully ask that we vote to send this paper to the athletic director at Medford High School and also the Hormel Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1030.859s">and</a> have them come up in unison with some naming dedication, Mr. President, that would rightfully fit Brian Branson and all the years, the decades of volunteerism and service to Medford High School athletes and the entire community in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1050.225s">So</a> I would respectfully offer that tonight, Mr. President, and I just want to personally thank Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1055.168s">We're</a> both 1984 graduates of Medford High School, and I just personally would like to thank him, Mr. President, for his many years of volunteerism in this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1534.379s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1540.723s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello mentioned, that Brian was synonymous with, John was synonymous with the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1549.249s">And</a> indeed, I got my haircut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1551.35s">I</a> think everyone, like you said, got their haircut at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1555.733s">And</a> you know what, Mr. President, I stopped going there because John gave one haircut. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1561.122s">So</a> when you went in there and said, I like this or this, John gave you the haircut he wanted to give you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1568.092s">Everyone</a> had that haircut, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1570.914s">He</a> was a good guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1571.674s">You</a> go in there, you talk about sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1573.996s">I</a> still don't know how, I know he's been there a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1576.817s">If</a> you look at him, he doesn't look like he's ready to retire. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1579.438s">He's</a> in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1581.359s">He's</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1582.32s">I</a> mean, everything about him looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1583.741s">I</a> wish him well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1585.381s">He</a> will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1586.762s">Those</a> faces that you come to know and love in an area, and then they're not there any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1592.425s">You</a> do miss it, Mr. President, but this retirement is well, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1596.727s">And</a> I wish him well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1599.23s">Thank</a> you, Counsel Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=1600.171s">Councilor</a> Scarapelli.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_L-hLu0ibDYc/2024-11-19_L-hLu0ibDYc.html">City Council 12-08-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1038.624s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I don't think anyone behind this reel thinks this is a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1044.55s">I</a> think what I'm hearing from my colleagues is that in the past when we approved food trucks, we always got date and location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1053.578s">And</a> I would feel more comfortable that we revisit this when there's an actual date and location of an actual truck that would like to come into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1063.771s">And</a> we'll take them as we've done in the past, Mr. President, each one on its own merit and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1069.537s">But</a> as this prepares tonight, just an open-ended, you know, list of potential, you know, food trucks, I couldn't support this tonight either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1081.865s">So</a> I would ask that the administration come back when they do have a full-fledged request.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1235.687s">Motion</a> received and placed on file, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1341.159s">Got</a> it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2147.516s">Councilor</a> Layton.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2156.358s">This</a> council last week tabled this request in order to notify residents of the Wellington and Haines Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2166.384s">And</a> in particular, I want to thank the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2169.565s">They</a> sent out a great robocall, in my opinion, alerting residents of this particular meeting how to participate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2178.11s">And</a> also, if they had any questions or concerns regarding this TIF <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2183.933s">And</a> this new establishment, a Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2186.316s">So</a> I want to thank the administration and thank this council for including residents in their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2193.242s">It's</a> very important during this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2197.325s">Mr.</a> President, I think it was about four years ago this council voted for the only TIF that I can recall with Bianco Sausage. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2205.312s">And</a> at the time, Mr. President, their commitment to this city was to add 20 new full-time jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2213.294s">And</a> now we're looking at a commitment of 250 jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2216.915s">So</a> I see this as a real job growth and economic recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2223.817s">revitalizer,</a> which I think will be good for the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2227.521s">And</a> I agree with my colleagues regarding living wages and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2232.506s">And</a> I'm sure we could probably work towards that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2238.148s">The</a> questions that I raised last week, I still have this week, Mr. President, and I'm going to propose them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2244.894s">And</a> I'm not sure if we've had any time to work on some of this, but I really would like to try to pin down the potential trucking routes <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2257.485s">to</a> this establishment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2260.388s">I</a> know we're talking about increasing business there from what currently exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2267.534s">And</a> I think it's important for those of us that actually surround this, there are neighborhoods around this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2275.902s">I</a> realize this is a commercial area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2278.864s">But</a> it's embedded in a residential neighborhood, both the Haines Square and the Wellington neighborhood with many residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2286.886s">So</a> I would like to find out from maybe Mr. Moniker if he's had the ability to respond to the question that I asked last week of what potential truck routes they will be looking at, knowing that two of the major roads that exist around this area don't allow major trucking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2309.171s">So</a> in my opinion, that would disperse trucks on some of the secondary roads, and I have a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2316.174s">So</a> that would be my first question, Mr. President, regarding the truck routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2321.217s">And</a> if Mr. Monica has had the opportunity to look into it, if not, I think it's something that still requires a response, Mr. President, to this council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2435.238s">Okay,</a> I appreciate you looking into that and I thank you for your response. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2441.387s">The</a> other question I had was, you mentioned originally that Monogram was going to open as two shifts with the potential of a third shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2452.562s">I</a> know at this point you probably can't commit, but I have a concern about a potential third shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2459.365s">And</a> I was wondering if a third shift would require the extended hours for any business, and would that be a vote of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2470.05s">This,</a> I don't think, is a question for Mr. Modica, but I don't know who else we have on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2474.953s">Do</a> we have Commissioner Moki or anyone else on the call?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2535.374s">Mr.</a> President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2543.117s">That</a> was helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2543.778s">So</a> Mr. President, knowing that this would require a special permit of the council, I think eases some of the concern I have regarding a third shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2553.666s">I'm</a> not saying I'm opposed to a third shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2555.848s">I</a> realize that the previous business, I believe, did have a third shift, an active third shift there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2561.693s">But</a> that eases some of my concerns of residents that I spoke to regarding potential trucking at 1, 2, 3 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2569.796s">And</a> we all know when 18 wheelers go by your house and hit the many potholes we have on our roads and the many divots we have, that it shakes homes and so forth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2580.379s">So</a> that's comforting to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2583.18s">My</a> third point, Mr. President, and I brought this up last week, and it's a major concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2589.584s">Middlesex</a> Ave, and I don't have to tell anyone behind this reel, is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2594.927s">The</a> sidewalk, the road, the lighting, everything on that road is a complete and utter disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2602.812s">There</a> hasn't been any attention, I've been in the area for almost 30 years now, and there hasn't been any attention to that road since I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2611.757s">And</a> that's no lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2613.297s">And</a> I realize it's a state road, and I'm hoping with this partnership through an act of state legislation, which is the TIF agreement, that we could get a commitment similar to what we received just recently from the Department of Transportation regarding the corner of Main Street and South Street, Mr. President, that the city administration, Todd Blake, the city engineer, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2643.704s">sit</a> and meet with the State Department of Transportation, Mr. President, and put together a full-fledged plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2651.207s">We're</a> talking about $40 million in renovation, and equipment, and a new establishment, and yet we're talking $0 about infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2664.026s">I</a> mean, I think it speaks volume about what we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2668.329s">And</a> it is that road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2671.091s">And</a> I would just like to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2673.312s">I</a> believe the mayor said that we had the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2679.176s">I</a> went through this about a month and a half ago with the BJ's gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2683.819s">One</a> of the major concerns was the exiting from BJ's location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2689.463s">And</a> again, it was stated, I believe Todd Blake was on the calls, that they would look at the exiting of that particular parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2700.053s">This</a> is no different, this is a door down. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2702.356s">This</a> is no different, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2704.518s">And</a> I think if we're going to talk about $40 million in this commitment, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2709.482s">It</a> should go hand in hand with improvements to that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2712.164s">So</a> I'd like to hear from the traffic engineer and the city engineer regarding what the next steps are and potentially how the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2722.149s">I'm</a> sorry, is it DeStefano, the woman from the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2726.072s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2728.133s">May</a> be able to get involved on an infrastructure type if indeed they do get involved in moving this forward where she is from the state, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2778.995s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2779.875s">Maybe</a> if we can hear from the city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2815.848s">So,</a> Todd, while we have you, I know you were involved with the BJ's gas station as part of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2824.734s">Can</a> you shed some light on what improvements, if any, are going to take place due to the recent approval of the BJ's gas station?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2909.525s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2910.025s">So</a> Todd, just to fill me in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2912.827s">So</a> is that commitment based on a commitment between BJ's and the Department of Transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2918.972s">How</a> does that work?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2954.242s">Okay,</a> so any commitment that's on Middlesex Ave would be a commitment of DOT, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2984.742s">So</a> what you're telling me is then eventually Monogram is going to have to go through the approval process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2990.725s">And</a> during that process, a similar agreement that was made with BJ's regarding the licensing and so forth will most likely take place with Monogram in the city regarding any safety concerns on Middlesex Ave.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3021.928s">So</a> I guess what I'm trying to do, and I don't feel warm and fuzzy from your response, I'm trying to figure out whose responsibility is it to make sure that Middlesex Ave gets the needed improvements during this approval of a $40 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3038.571s">As</a> we heard from Vice President Caraviello, it's probably one of the larger endeavors that this city has seen, and I don't hear any infrastructure mentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3048.599s">And</a> I find that hard to believe that we're not discussing infrastructure improvements during such a large project.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3066.909s">Anyone</a> from the administration that would like to handle that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3070.171s">I</a> just would like to hear some more concrete information on what potentially negotiations will exist, what meetings are going to be called, what's going to happen to that roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3083.919s">Has</a> anyone walked down that roadway? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3085.6s">Am</a> I the only one that's ever walked down Middlesex Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3089.402s">It's</a> a complete nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3091.023s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3091.563s">It's</a> a complete nightmare.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3466.935s">Councilor</a> Marks, you had the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3468.776s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3469.796s">I</a> know my colleagues have other questions, too, so I'll be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3475.037s">I</a> just want to make sure, Mr. President, and it sounds like the city has given this some consideration on looking at some of the infrastructure that exists, in particular, Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3486.28s">So</a> I do feel comfortable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3488.961s">As</a> a community, we can no longer sit back and state that, oh, I'm sorry, this is a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3494.603s">We</a> can't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3495.943s">Because</a> it's difficult to tell a taxpayer when they're paying $8,000 in taxes that, sorry, we can't touch your tree, we can't trim your tree, we can't do your sidewalk, and we have nothing to do with your road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3507.875s">That's</a> very difficult, Mr. President, and I think these conversations have to be had when we have the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3514.181s">And</a> a $40 million renovation, in my opinion, is the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3518.864s">And</a> I hope the city keeps us informed regarding what the next steps are on state road improvements, in particular Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3528.91s">Regarding</a> the TIF agreement itself, Mr. President, and this may be a question for Chief of Staff Rodriguez, is there language in there that would state that there's a 90 day notice <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3541.437s">of</a> any corporate decision to change the nature or the character of their business operations to notify the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3551.195s">Is</a> there any language that speaks to that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3578.4s">So</a> Mr. President, I had the opportunity to look at a few recent TIF agreements, and they had language that stated just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3588.606s">So</a> I thought it would be helpful that when and if and when we put this agreement together, and I would just state this as a motion, that the administration add a 90-day notice of any corporate decision to change the nature and or character <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3606.116s">of</a> their business operations that they notified the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3612.211s">And</a> naturally, if the attorney has to put that, that's just language that I jotted down quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3618.615s">So</a> I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3622.357s">Also</a> that if there's not already currently that exist, and again, this would be a question for Mr. Rodriguez, that annual reports on job creation, retention of Method residents be provided to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3638.45s">as</a> the city of Medford, and I'm not sure if that language currently exists or something similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3643.703s">It</a> doesn't have to be the exact. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3646.791s">Yeah,</a> it's in section 70 of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3650.214s">Okay,</a> so we can eliminate that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3653.057s">And</a> then I think as Councilor Morell mentioned, there should be language in there within the TIF agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3660.023s">Failure</a> to comply will result in decertification. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3664.307s">Somewhere</a> that should be listed within the TIF agreement itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3668.59s">Mr.</a> President, and I'm not sure if that's currently in there now, but I would recommend if it's not, that that be a motion as well, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3681.524s">That's</a> off. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3682.165s">So</a> it would be just- Thank you, Mr. Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3686.446s">So</a> it would be just that one motion, Mr. President, that the 90 day notice, if there's any change in their business nature or character of their business, that they notify the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3699.49s">And</a> that's it for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3700.59s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3832.043s">Board</a> of Information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3842.075s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I appreciate that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3845.516s">However,</a> we did notify thousands of Method residents of this meeting, and we have yet to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3853.579s">I</a> know we started off with the council, so I look eager to hear from residents and maybe some of the concerns that may exist out there, Mr. President, as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4550.156s">Any</a> corporate decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4551.116s">Any</a> corporate decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4551.837s">Yeah,</a> not corporate, any corporate decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4553.338s">Corporate</a> decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4553.978s">To</a> change, yeah.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6129.049s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the comments by Mr. Navar that regarding the residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6139.761s">And</a> some of what he mentioned, if not all, is completely on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6145.247s">that</a> we heard tonight from the city assessor that Method is a desirable community because we have such a low residential tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6154.849s">And</a> therefore, people want to come into the community and buy property because we have such a great low tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6163.511s">And</a> on the flip side, Mr. President, commercial business may not see fit to come to our community because of the extremely aggressive and high tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6175.814s">And</a> when we do the split rate, which we've been doing for years, we've always shifted, and I voted for it, we've always shifted the burden from the residents to commercial, saying, well, they're a commercial business and they should pay more in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6195.81s">And</a> I agree with that, Mr. President, but I think you get it to a point where <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6200.974s">The</a> burden on the commercial, Mr. President, is having an impact on the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6206.118s">And</a> when you see the percent of property in our community by value by class, almost 90% of the percent of levy <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6219.527s">that</a> we derive from our income is for residential property, 90%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6227.233s">And</a> then the commercial industrial make up 8.72%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6230.155s">So</a> you can see over the years, the shift, we're losing a lot of the commercial base, which we rely on now because they pay a much higher tax rate and we're gaining more residential, which pays a lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6244.325s">And</a> at some point, we as a community are going to make a tough decision and say we don't have enough of this commercial that we've been shifting the burden to, to support our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6255.113s">And</a> I think that's going to be the question, Mr. President, that we're going to have to answer to eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6261.298s">And</a> I think it's creeping around sooner than we expect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6266.139s">The</a> numbers, if you look at the single tax rate, which we haven't supported since I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6272.56s">If</a> you look at the single tax rate, so that would be one tax rate for both commercial and residential, an average single family would pay $6,326. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6285.88s">And</a> the average commercial business would pay $14,707. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6290.161s">So</a> that's with one tax rate for both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6294.722s">Then</a> you look at it, Mr. President, and if you were going to do a split rate, which we currently do, at 115%, the average single family would pay $6,215 and the average commercial would pay $6,915. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6311.068s">Then</a> if you fast forward that into what we currently do is a split rate with 175% shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6316.869s">The</a> average single family pays 5,768, so you can see it's decreased. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6318.87s">And</a> the average commercial pays 25,737. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6320.93s">So</a> they went with the single tax rate from 14,000 for commercial up to 25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6337.295s">And</a> then if you split the rate at 115%, they went from 16,000 to 25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6343.721s">Those</a> are huge jumps, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6347.664s">And</a> if you look at, if we were to reverse this a little bit and look at shifting the burden to residential, the average single family at 175, at the single family rate, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6363.428s">The</a> single rate would pay $6,000, and at the split rate would pay $6,215. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6367.569s">The</a> difference, really, if we sat down and started going through this, because you're shifting it over so many different properties, it's not as big as the commercial side. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6381.014s">And</a> I know it's not a popular thing to say, but if we're really serious about keeping commercial in this city, Mr. President, and expanding the commercial tax base, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6391.838s">I</a> think we have to take a look at it at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6394.221s">And</a> sometimes, you know, officials have to stand up and take tough votes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6399.486s">But</a> I think it's something we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6401.829s">And,</a> you know, it's probably not going to be this time, but I think next year I would request, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6409.256s">that</a> we have meetings a month or two prior to the budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6415.457s">I'm</a> sorry, the tax vote meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6418.298s">So</a> we could start looking at the residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6420.939s">So</a> we could start looking at the residential exemption that has been discussed about by area residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6430.081s">And</a> give us enough lead time to make some informed decisions rather than tonight, which most of us, to be quite honest with you, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6440.604s">I</a> hate to say it, our hands are tied, because this is based on the budget that we put forward and it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6448.452s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President, under the leadership of yourself or whoever, as the Council of Vice President, Kaviel's the next president, that we have meetings well in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6461.185s">to</a> when we set the tax rate so we can discuss some of the issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6466.008s">As</a> we heard tonight, I always thought that the tax rate was due at the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6470.71s">We</a> heard that you could vote on it to have it done at the end of June, which gives you another six months of additional <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6479.335s">growth</a> that you could use in a time of recession like we're seeing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6484.742s">That's</a> six months that could add some new growth onto it and give us some additional revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6489.807s">And</a> that's the lead time I think we need as a council to start discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6495.974s">I'm</a> prepared to vote on this tonight, Mr. President, but I think, you know, we have to take a long, hard look at how we average out the property in our community and see if it makes sense to continue to shift the way we're shifting if we're really serious about keeping a commercial base in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6514.706s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6798.98s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6800.701s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6805.584s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6806.845s">I</a> just wanted to clarify that last year when we discussed the residential exemption, and I know Mr. Castagnetti has been a stalwart regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6819.393s">He</a> says 10 years, I think he's been talking about this for 20 years, or at least it seems 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6825.86s">So</a> long, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6828.222s">Last</a> year when we discussed it, I think Councilor Knight brought up the fact that the numbers that we received that were the break even point for assessments over, I think it was 640,000 Councilor Knight mentioned, was a little over 2,000 households that were owner occupied, that lived in their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6848.022s">If</a> we voted for residential exemption, because their property was assessed at over a certain amount of money, which was the break even point, they would still have to pay a higher tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6858.984s">And</a> we were told there were about 2,000 properties in the community, that was last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6863.825s">And</a> that's a number I've been monitoring over the years, because I think we as a council, I won't speak for anyone else, said if the numbers were falling, meaning that there were less and less people that fell in this range. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6876.507s">that</a> were the exception to the rule that we may see favorable to vote on this and provide a property tax, a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6886.698s">We</a> heard tonight, Mr. President, from the city assessor that they're saying now there's over 4,000 properties that are above the break even point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6897.148s">And</a> in addition, out of the 4,000, 1,300 properties of people that are over the age of 60, which are seniors in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6906.933s">So</a> these numbers are very staggering, Mr. President, and there may have been a discrepancy over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6913.877s">As</a> we heard from the city's assessor, and I won't put words in her mouth, that they may have not been counting every type of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6922.245s">So</a> they may have been just looking at single families and not condos or two families or multi-families. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6931.773s">So</a> this number, in my opinion, is a little alarming that there's so many people that would fall out of the range of residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6941.576s">And</a> I'm looking forward to discussions possibly in March regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6949.819s">actually</a> taking a closer look at this and seeing if these are the true numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6954.042s">I</a> think the city assessor made a commitment that she would revisit these numbers to see if they're true and accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6961.006s">But</a> I just want Mr. Castagnetti and others to know that we do monitor this, we do keep an eye on this, and the numbers have fluctuated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6969.711s">And</a> in this case, they fluctuated in a way that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6974.854s">I</a> couldn't support at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6976.955s">There's</a> just too many people, Mr. President, that would be impacted by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6981.739s">And</a> I think the good outweighs the bad in this, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7984.137s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7985.277s">And</a> I want to thank Mr. LaRusso for expressing interest in coming to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7991.399s">I</a> just had a couple of really quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7995.02s">What</a> would his staff consist of?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8022.888s">And</a> would your establishment consist of strictly tattooing or would it be body piercing as well?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8033.83s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8035.151s">And</a> I'm sure you're familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8036.791s">You</a> said you work for a current tattoo establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8042.858s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8043.619s">So</a> I'm sure you're aware of all the proper protocols and procedures for the placement of syringes and needles and anything else associated with your business, blood and any other bodily fluids that are associated with your particular business.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8124.557s">And</a> what would you anticipate your hours of operation to be in general?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8154.038s">Are</a> we looking at how many days a week?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8167.327s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8167.967s">And</a> if you were to know there was another establishment that existed within a hundred yards from your establishment that does the same type of tattooing, would that discourage you from going to this location?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8239.627s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8240.107s">And</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8242.389s">And</a> the reason why I bring it up is because Council Vice President Caraviello brought up a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8248.094s">We,</a> this council, approved a tattoo parlor, probably 100 yards, 200 yards from the establishment that you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8257.022s">And,</a> you know, I think it's unfair that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8261.666s">that</a> hasn't taken place yet, and most people have probably forgotten about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8266.21s">And</a> here you are, a new establishment coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8268.452s">So</a> I think it's important to know what may eventually, or already has been approved, but may eventually pop up next door to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8275.799s">Because</a> people make business decisions based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8279.603s">A</a> number of factors, and that could be one, proximity of other like establishments and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8284.868s">And</a> maybe that's something we have to look at as a council when we issue a special permit that I believe, as Councilor Knight mentioned, and he'd probably know better than I, that it's good for up to a year, which sounds kind of excessive, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8301.06s">And</a> I think that opens up a lot of different doors when you have things hanging out there and you're not sure what may or may not go in there after approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8311.027s">So</a> that's something we may want to look at as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8314.509s">And</a> my last thing is I have to admit, I am a little jealous of Reverend Wendy's tattoo. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8320.893s">And</a> if she's willing, maybe she could show us some more of her tattoos because that was pretty impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8331.08s">But</a> I wish you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8333.261s">And</a> I wish you all but good luck.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9164.322s">And</a> I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9169.144s">So,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9170.645s">Cut</a> the marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9172.112s">So</a> last we left off, Mr. President, is that legal counsel from National Grid was going to speak to our acting city's solicitor regarding some mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9185.025s">And</a> I'm very eager to hear what the results have been, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9280.584s">So,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9286.675s">I'm</a> a little disappointed that we've waited this long to get that answer, because that answer does not address what this Medford City Council has requested in regards to mitigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9301.148s">And</a> if we have to rehash this, I'm willing to go over it again tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9305.512s">But</a> this council requested that some mitigation be put forth by either the MWRA or National Grid <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9313.96s">regarding</a> the curbing on that stretch of Riverside F. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9319.738s">And</a> we were told that originally they weren't willing to do the whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9324.761s">I</a> think this council stood up and said, we're not looking for you to do the whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9329.024s">We're</a> looking for you to set aside some money that we as a community can put into bringing the curbs up higher than the street, where much of the curbing is level with the road and very dangerous for pedestrian safety in that particular area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9348.515s">And</a> now we're hearing that as part of this project, it could be a lag of up to eight to 20 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9357.721s">So</a> they may start the spring of 2021 and not finish for 20 months out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9364.566s">And</a> what they'll do is put down a binary code, coding, whatever it is, so that we can ride on it for 20 months while it looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9377.795s">you</a> know, a pile of you know what. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9381.318s">It</a> doesn't make any sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9383.42s">This</a> makes zero sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9385.322s">Why</a> would we want, as a community, want to sit on a construction site for 20 months? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9390.547s">And</a> the residents that have to live there, Mr. President, when they open their door and face that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9397.154s">It</a> just makes no sense to me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9399.455s">I'm</a> very disappointed that National Grid's not willing to step up, Mr. President, on a project of this size and help out the community in regards to mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9412.02s">They</a> pay mitigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9414.782s">There's</a> no bones about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9417.063s">Legal</a> or not legal, they pay mitigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9420.762s">So</a> if that's the case tonight, they don't have my vote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9425.464s">They're</a> not going to move forward with my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9427.344s">Other</a> members of the council may see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9429.445s">But</a> we got zero out of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9433.046s">Nothing</a> but inconvenience for the residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9436.588s">And</a> don't forget, this started out with doing construction during the holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9441.79s">And</a> then they pushed it a little further back. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9444.531s">And</a> now we're hearing there could be a 20-month lag in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9448.985s">How</a> does that benefit us? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9451.625s">Benefits</a> their schedule, the MWRA and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9455.086s">How</a> does that benefit the city of Medford on a major thoroughfare in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9460.847s">It</a> doesn't, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9462.307s">And</a> if they're not willing to sit down and talk mitigation, they don't have this council's support. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9467.108s">And</a> I hope my other council colleagues stand up too, Mr. President, on what's right on behalf of this community and its residents.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9572.678s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9574.039s">My</a> definition of mitigation may be a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9578.521s">Restoring</a> back to how it was is a given. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9581.822s">That's</a> what happens on every utility project in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9585.903s">Every</a> utility project, they're required to return it back to the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9590.606s">Mitigation</a> is going over and above, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9593.447s">We're</a> asking over and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9595.068s">We're</a> not asking to restore the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9597.349s">That's</a> how every project is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9600.039s">So</a> I'm not, I think our definition is a little different, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9604.322s">And,</a> you know, it doesn't matter to me that National Grid's stepping in on behalf of, because they have to move their utility so the MWRA could do what they, it doesn't matter to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9616.772s">They're</a> both utilities, Mr. President, and they both should step up to the plate and assist this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9623.197s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11349.621s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11350.741s">And</a> I want to thank the two chairs, Laurel and Jim, for their dedication to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11357.283s">They've</a> been involved with a lot of different projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11360.384s">And</a> this project is a big undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11364.925s">I</a> sat on the original parking enforcement committee back some, I don't know, probably 10 years ago now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11371.427s">And</a> at that time, it was a large undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11373.968s">And</a> they're taking on, in addition, the Green Line extension and some other issues that city-wide permit parking and some other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11382.11s">My</a> question to the two chairs is, if someone's interested in a particular subject, as you know, there's a lot involved with from enforcement to districts to meters or kiosk and how we're going to enforce things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11399.516s">If</a> someone is just interested in one aspect, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11403.757s">How</a> do they know when that will be brought up? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11406.197s">Are</a> they allowed to get onto the Wednesday meetings and just bring up any subject, or is there an agenda that you follow and talk about just certain items? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11416.259s">How</a> does that work?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11459.961s">So</a> how, as a commission, are you publicizing your meetings and are they well attended over the last, you know, several weeks since you've been meeting?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11501.231s">So</a> is the expectation at some point that you're going to have, you know, like a full-blown public hearing where residents will be invited to hear recommendations and give input? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11517.084s">Is</a> that the ultimate?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11556.353s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11557.094s">And</a> just if I can give a word of caution, I think that's one thing that could get in the way of this whole process, is that if the public input is held, and I'm not saying this is the case, but if it's held to the end, you may get a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11573.989s">animosity</a> and people thinking they've been left out of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11578.41s">And</a> so somehow, and it's a difficult, I agree with you, there's a lot going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11583.911s">Somehow</a> I think it's important that public hearings be set up along this whole process and not just wait till the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11593.052s">And</a> I'll leave that up to the committee, but I would highly recommend that in the interest of transparency and so forth.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12099.354s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12100.433s">Mr.</a> President, just one question regarding the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12105.716s">Does</a> it include recommendations regarding taking the parking service in-house as well as removal of the kiosk? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12114.802s">Will</a> that be things that the commission works on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12162.735s">So</a> your ultimate recommendations will include looking at whether or not to take in-house or to look at an alternative from the kiosk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12253.935s">How's</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12255.136s">That</a> sounds like a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12257.738s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12260.628s">So</a> I just want to understand, so this commission will be making recommendations from what I'm hearing sometime in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12267.53s">That's</a> when the mayor asked for recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12270.671s">And</a> then the actual implementation, has there been any discussion about once recommendations are with the mayor, has there been any discussion about implementation, which is I would assume the next phase of this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12291.895s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12513.356s">Councilman</a> Harkes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12515.357s">If</a> Council and I wouldn't mind amending it, I got a complaint recently about the top of Governor's Ave along South Border Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12522.001s">Same</a> thing, brown water. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12523.922s">The</a> fire department's been out there opening up the hydrants and releasing some of the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12528.384s">And</a> then within a couple of weeks, the water's brown again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12531.066s">They</a> put two cups side by side. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12532.707s">And</a> you can clearly see that there's something going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12537.049s">And</a> so if Councilor Knight wouldn't mind adding the top of Governor's Ave along Saltwater Road, if that could be reviewed at the same time, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12546.7s">Excellent.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12594.163s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12595.104s">I</a> think it was about 13 or 14 months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12597.686s">This</a> council did a committee, the whole review of the lot of land in between Budweiser and the residents on Sydney Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12608.175s">It</a> was all overgrown, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12610.377s">The</a> trees, we took a walk through that whole area and it was gnarly back there and very dangerous actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12618.226s">And</a> due to this council and the city administration with their help, Budweiser actually, because they own the property, went back there and did actually, I have to say, a great job of cleaning up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12630.82s">They</a> left a lot of the mature trees along the fences of neighbors on Sydney, of which they did go out recently and cut some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12640.245s">84</a> Sydney just contacted me and said there's a big overhanging branch of a very mature tree that's on the Anheuser Budweiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12651.691s">and</a> they ask in the interest of public safety, because they're concerned with the recent windstorms, that the branches be cut back in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12660.854s">So</a> I ask that this be sent to DPW and the city engineer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12667.716s">I</a> believe they're the ones that intervened last time on our behalf.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14344.402s">Is</a> this for take-out only or is it for dine-in take-out? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14350.043s">Good</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14350.604s">I'm</a> not quite sure what this applies to.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14518.492s">Well,</a> I'm not sure, Mr. President, if we currently don't have enough resources, why would we add on another administrative responsibility if we don't have enough resources right now to control what we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14531.325s">I</a> just don't know what this is getting at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14535.912s">If</a> I'm at work and I order a cup of soup and it arrives and there's no spoon, that's a concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14542.974s">And</a> I guess we take for granted that a restaurant, if I'm doing takeout, is going to put the necessary things in the bag so I can consume my food. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14555.098s">And</a> part of that may be a straw, a napkin, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14560.719s">And</a> so I'm not quite sure what this is getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14563.161s">Is</a> this COVID related or is this outside of COVID? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14567.625s">I</a> don't know what this is getting at.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14667.407s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14668.127s">Just</a> if I could, I'm a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14673.648s">If</a> it's something we can't enforce, then why are we asking to a border health and the energy environment office to establish a policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14685.57s">If</a> it's something we can't enforce and then only to only provide plastic utensils upon request. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14692.592s">So</a> you're asking businesses, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14694.988s">not</a> to provide this unless someone asks you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14697.909s">So</a> I don't understand how they're saying in one point it's, you know, it's only, you know, it's, it's, it's just guidance, but they want a policy that surrounds it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14710.187s">and</a> I assume a policy, you know, to me, the better approach would be if this is a cause and something you're interested in, why not approach the Chamber of Commerce and ask the Chamber of Commerce, hey, you know what, we're concerned about the plastic utensils and the number of utensils that are given out and I share a lot of those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14729.691s">But</a> I'm not sure a legislative enactment or a policy has to be the way to go about getting the word out in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14738.364s">You</a> may have businesses owners that would love to save money, because they're very expensive, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14745.153s">And</a> they may love to save money on that, but I'm not sure this is the appropriate way of doing this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14751.638s">And</a> we heard for a long period of time about doing away with straws. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14758.363s">Now</a> it's stirrers, plastic utensils. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14764.508s">I</a> just think there's a better way of doing this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14767.91s">Therefore,</a> I cannot support this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14769.511s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15040.166s">Why</a> would we send a draft ordinance to the city solicitor for review?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15052.612s">Why</a> would we have a city solicitor look at a seven page draft ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15058.058s">that</a> hasn't been looked at by this council, no recommendations by this council, no public meeting by this council, other than the fact that it paid off this agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15067.842s">Why</a> would we send this paper to the city solicitor for review? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15072.304s">Review</a> of what? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15073.884s">Review</a> of this language? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15076.258s">Is</a> the city solicitor now part of this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15080.62s">I</a> mean, I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15082.061s">I</a> don't understand putting the seven-page ordinance on, Mr. President, because we have ways of initiating subjects, Mr. President, for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15092.826s">But,</a> hey, that could be, you know, I'm not going to criticize that, but why would we send a paper to the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15100.029s">It</a> makes zero sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15102.99s">I</a> would like to provide some answers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15164.369s">That</a> seems like a convoluted way of going about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15167.291s">It</a> really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15168.952s">I</a> know I appreciate your response, but that seems like we're the legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15173.595s">So</a> if this is language that we want to attain, we should send it to committee, the whole subcommittee, take a look at it, review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15181.759s">It</a> just doesn't make sense, especially now knowing that the city solicitor may be working on an ordinance at this council's request and then giving her another seven pages, saying take a look at this, unless we think she's doing nothing all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15194.444s">It</a> just makes no sense to me.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15197.706s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15360.153s">What</a> prior paper are you referring to?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15383.545s">So</a> maybe that's what needs to be had rather than... You know, we can entertain new language, but this seems like it's... <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15390.35s">asking</a> for its own separate process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15393.493s">And</a> I think, you know, it's, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15398.216s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15480.977s">No</a> one's saying it's controversial. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15483.079s">We're</a> just saying there's an order of how we do business, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15486.562s">If</a> we're discussing an item already in subcommittee or committee of the whole, and to reintroduce something different, Mr. President, on the floor is not how we operate as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15496.53s">That's</a> all that's being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15498.131s">That's</a> not how we operate, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_TH89eXSxkYo/2024-11-19_TH89eXSxkYo.html">City Council 12-01-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=125.111s">Eight</a> spots off-street? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=126.892s">Eight</a> spots in the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=129.492s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=130.413s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=131.193s">I</a> move approval.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=222.808s">Mr.</a> President, I'll just defer to Councilor Scarpelli.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=321.852s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=322.492s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=323.272s">If</a> I could, thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=324.693s">I</a> appreciate the fact that both chiefs are on tonight, as well as the union representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=332.356s">I</a> believe both on the police and fire side are both with us tonight as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=339.041s">As</a> Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, the concern I have and the reason why I added my name to this resolution was the fact that we did receive a correspondence from Mayor Lungo-Koehn regarding the urgent need and the emergency of <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=357.375s">putting</a> this particular position forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=360.879s">And</a> when I saw that email, Mr. President, it kind of alarmed me that there was a concern of that urgency within 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=369.991s">First,</a> that I'm hearing that 9-1-1 has existed for the past year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=376.158s">And</a> I would hope that there was proper supervision. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=379.66s">I</a> would hope there was proper training policies and procedures set up in that past year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=385.604s">So</a> I'm eager to hear tonight from both chiefs to hopefully dispel the emergency that was stated by the mayor in her email. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=399.712s">And</a> hear from both chiefs, Mr. President, and the union representatives as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=404.035s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=566.375s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=567.436s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Longo.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=570.177s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=571.157s">I</a> appreciate the mayor being on the call tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=574.419s">So</a> the question I have to the mayor, Mr. President, is the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=580.401s">I</a> can appreciate, and it's the mayor's opinion, that this is a critical need for the operation of public safety in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=588.585s">And</a> she has every right to state that if she believes that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=592.126s">My</a> question is that since January of this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=596.648s">The</a> fire department has reached out on several occasions to not only the city administration, but to both Chiefs, Chief Gilberti and Chief Buckley regarding their concerns with 911 and some of the concerns that they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=612.514s">that</a> they raised back in January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=615.475s">So</a> I'm just wondering when the mayor figured out that this was a public safety emergency and why did it take almost 11 months to do so?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=694.592s">Right,</a> so Mr. President, if I could follow up, and I appreciate that statement, but it still doesn't answer what happened from January to the past, even if we say two months that they've been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=705.738s">What</a> happened to the seven months in between that, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=709.58s">And</a> I'm looking at a correspondence from Union President Eddie Buckley from January 21st of this year, raising concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=720.185s">And</a> that email was sent to Fire Chief Gilberti. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=723.887s">Police</a> Chief Buckley, Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, and Union Rep Harold McGilvery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=730.371s">And</a> if you could, Mr. President, I'd like to just read it briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=733.514s">It</a> says, good morning, gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=735.115s">I</a> would like to formally request a meeting with all interested parties to discuss the future of dispatching. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=742.059s">There</a> are too many rumors and scuttlebutt going around, and we as a union would like to meet face to face to communicate our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=751.48s">get</a> a grasp on the future of fire dispatch. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=755.521s">Please</a> let me know at your convenience when we would be able to be a good time to sit down and talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=761.222s">Thank</a> you for your attention to this matter, Eddie Buckley, Union President 1032. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=767.284s">The</a> same day, Mr. President, Union Rep Harold McGillivray reached out and gave his availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=774.917s">Mr.</a> President, but the part that I'm troubled by is Fire Chief Gilberti never responded to the request by the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=786.531s">The</a> Mayor's Chief of Staff, Dave Rodriguez, never responded to their request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=792.33s">And</a> Chief Buckley responded saying, thank you for your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=796.893s">At</a> this time, I will decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=798.995s">So</a> I'm trying to figure out, Mr. President, if this was an issue that's been brought up, and this actually dates back actually even prior to January, when a letter was sent out in June 2019 to the former mayor, Burke, asking for a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=818.568s">which</a> was never responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=820.67s">So</a> this has been a year and a half, and now 10 or 11 months under this administration, going on 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=827.895s">And</a> I'm just concerned, Mr. President, with the lack of attention for the last, from January to just say September, October. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=835.94s">when</a> nothing was done and now all of a sudden meetings are being held and we're being told it's an emergency, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=843.506s">But</a> from what I'm being told, there was concerns all along, Mr. President, from day one when this 911 center opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=852.172s">From</a> day one, there was a lack of a manual, a lack of policies and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=856.935s">And</a> there has been very little put into trying to get to the bottom of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=863.398s">And</a> I think everyone behind this room, I won't speak for them, no one's opposed to the position, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=868.68s">We</a> had some legitimate questions regarding the position, and I'm hoping to hear tonight what's being worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=875.182s">But</a> I have other questions, and I'll wait to hear as soon as both chiefs respond, and hopefully the union representatives.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=892.754s">If</a> they'd like to respond, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1440.471s">We</a> weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1442.091s">Mr.</a> President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1443.532s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1445.312s">With</a> all due respect, Mr. President, I'll let the union reps that are on the phone now dictate whatever their narrative is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1453.575s">Because</a> clearly, that's not their feedback that I received, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1457.777s">So</a> I guess there's two different realities going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1462.138s">And</a> so I'd like to hear from the union representatives as well, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1470.324s">At</a> some point, Mr. President, I'd like maybe for the chief to finish his presentation, but I'd like to hear from them too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1478.19s">Okay,</a> Chief Buckley, if you want to continue.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1730.747s">I</a> guess my question would be to Mr. Buckley is what have been the concerns for the past year and a half that have been raised by the fire department regarding their concerns with 911 in the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1876.374s">So</a> based on the October 26th letter that was written by local 1032 regarding concerns of method fire and in particular delays in dispatching calls and lack of supervision. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1892.601s">I</a> was wondering if you can address that particular letter that was sent to the city administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1930.702s">Mr.</a> President, also, maybe if you can address the July 27th letter, which discusses manpower on assignments on multiple alarm fires and the dispatch policy that was created without any input from the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1945.787s">Has</a> that been rectified?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1985.656s">I'd</a> like to hear from Harold, Mr. President, Mr. McGillivray. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1988.317s">But</a> also, Mr. President, I guess what it takes to get things done in this community is a resolution by this Medford City Council to get people to act on certain items. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=1998.943s">And</a> I'm glad to see both chiefs met last night, Mr. President, after many emails going out regarding concerns of <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=2008.409s">a</a> lack of supervision and delays in dispatching over the past 11 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=2014.814s">And</a> now they're being addressed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=2016.795s">So</a> if anything, I am happy that I put my name on this, Mr. President, to make sure on behalf of the 58,000 residents of this community that 911 indeed protects the residents of this community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=2057.199s">I</a> just made my statement, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=2162.823s">Thank</a> you, Chief Gilberti. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=2164.163s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=2165.324s">Councilor</a> Lox. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=2166.965s">Mr.</a> President, since we trained and lost a number of dispatches, I was wondering if there was any exit interviews given, and if so, what were the sentiments of the candidates that were trained and given a job here in the city of Medford, and then after a short period of time decided to leave, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3057.629s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3059.209s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3061.77s">I</a> just want to be able to understand, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3066.371s">This</a> issue of civilian 911 was being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3071.433s">And</a> at the time when they decided to move forward, I'd like to be privy to what the discussions were around hiring a civilian 911 supervisor at that time, a year and a half ago, if any. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3087.319s">Because</a> I think it's important, Mr. President, there's not one member behind this reel that I've heard once say, we don't need the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3095.422s">There's</a> not one person for the last three weeks, I've never heard one person say, this is not needed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3102.326s">We</a> have been asking questions on why it's an emergency right now, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3107.629s">And</a> I'll continue to ask them, like Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello have mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3113.672s">But</a> I'd like to know, Mr. President, a year and a half ago, when the powers to be sat down and started discussing how this 911 center was going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3123.798s">What</a> were the discussions around hiring someone from the start that had that supervisory skill to oversee this department, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3133.583s">And</a> to make sure that the proper unified training manuals were set up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3140.046s">To</a> make sure the rules and procedures and policies were set up to set up our workers for success, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3148.57s">and</a> not failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3149.771s">People</a> leave for a lot of different reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3152.353s">Some</a> may be location, but others may leave, Mr. President, for other reasons, such as lack of supervision and lack of a clear, defined training manual and other reasons, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3167.467s">They</a> may not state it, Mr. President, but they leave for a host of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3172.05s">But</a> I'd like to know why from the inception that we did not hire, don't forget we just went through the budget this June 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3181.657s">If</a> this has been discussed for the last year and a half, why was it in the June 2020 budget, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3189.423s">Why</a> are we looking at a supplemental after the fact? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3193.465s">So</a> I'd like to know why this wasn't discussed, and if it was, I'd like to know why and why it didn't get in to the planning of this 911 center. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3202.853s">As</a> Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, to me that's critical to have someone that oversees and has the experience in both police and fire and able to put this together and create the policies and manuals and the hiring and the training. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3219.326s">101,</a> Mr. President, of creating a dispatch center. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3222.047s">So</a> I'd like to know why that didn't happen originally.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3382.307s">So</a> Mr. President, just so I understand, and I appreciate Chief Gilberti's response. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3389.83s">So</a> if the chief was advocating for a fire supervisor, and I'm sure the police were advocating for a police supervisor, we ended up instead of having <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3401.717s">both</a> Mr. President, no trained supervisor at all for the past year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3408.401s">And</a> this is no reflection on Lieutenant Rudolph, because he stated himself that this is not really his expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3416.886s">And</a> he can't really train, he can't really oversee, because he's not aware of what's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3424.15s">in</a> the dispatch to really supervise it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3428.432s">And</a> I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I just don't understand how you may be advocating for something, but it resulted in no supervision at all for the past year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3438.515s">And</a> I should say no trained supervision, no expertise in 911 for the last year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3446.618s">And</a> that's the shortcoming, Mr. President, that I have a concern with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3450.459s">And</a> we've had the last 11 months to do something, and finally we're getting a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3455.442s">In</a> my opinion, if this was such an emergency, I would have sent it out as its own paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3461.845s">Having</a> a reverse 911 supervisor as its own paper, not mixed in with nine other items, like an interpreter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3470.93s">and</a> other things, Mr. President, in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3473.613s">So</a> that would be how I would have handled it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3475.856s">But</a> again, I'm not the chief executive officer of this city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3480.602s">And</a> that's how they chose to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3482.604s">Because</a> maybe if it was submitted in that fashion, this would have been handled three weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3487.89s">Mr.</a> President, so I'm still not happy with the answers regarding the lack of supervision, the lack of a trained personnel to oversee this department, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3499.536s">And</a> we don't know what this has resulted in, the lack of manuals, policies, and procedures over the last year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3508.0s">We</a> don't know potential lawsuits or anything else that may be brewing in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=3513.843s">over</a> this 9-1-1, and I guess that'll speak for itself, Mr. President, at some point.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4632.821s">Councilor</a> Marks, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4634.482s">Just</a> a point of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4636.103s">It</a> was stated that this paper would die tonight because the tax rate <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4644.537s">You</a> can't vote on it after the tax rate's set. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4647.798s">When</a> are we setting the tax rate, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4657.642s">So</a> we have another week if the mayor wanted to submit a paper, a revised paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4662.024s">Withdraw</a> the current $740,000 supplemental amendment amount and submit a revised paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4671.148s">The</a> tax rate won't be set before next Tuesday, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4678.024s">So</a> we do have another week.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4685.691s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4685.991s">So</a> if we vote on the paper Tuesday night, that'll be prior to us setting the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4690.96s">correct?</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4723.176s">Right,</a> so if the mayor submits a new paper next week amended to approve the supervisory position in 911, you know what the dollar amount is already. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4736.143s">This</a> council, I think, has stated, and I won't speak for everyone, a commitment for that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4741.405s">I</a> don't see why that can't be done next week, Mr. President, and added into the paperwork that Alicia is saying, because she's right, she probably needs time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4750.072s">But</a> I think we're able to forecast now, we have a week to forecast that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4756.877s">I</a> don't see why that can't be done.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4761.3s">It</a> almost seems like people don't want it done, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6880.335s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6884.845s">Mr.</a> President, I have a few questions on the same line as Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6891.388s">Can</a> you get a little more specific on the types of trucks that will be entering and exiting your particular facility? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6900.472s">Are</a> we looking at 18 wheelers? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6902.392s">Are</a> we looking at refrigerated trucks? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6904.553s">What</a> type of truck?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6954.906s">Okay,</a> and you're aware that you have residential neighbors on both sides, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6963.527s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6964.728s">Okay,</a> and regarding your plant that after full build out, compared to what's there currently, how much more manufacturing will be done on that site?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7024.178s">Okay,</a> and did you state that you do both retail and wholesale?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7065.097s">Okay,</a> so regarding, get back to the trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7070.48s">Are</a> you aware that there are many surrounding roads where you're located that do not accept heavy trucking?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7098.742s">Well,</a> that's a tough question to answer because as you just alluded to, you're not sure what the older capacity was at the existing site. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7109.209s">And</a> it seems like you're going to be growing the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7112.571s">And</a> I could just tell you from a first hand experience that <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7116.353s">The</a> Fellsway, many of your class A trucks cannot use the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7121.117s">They</a> cannot use Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7123.899s">And</a> I would be very curious to see if this work has been done ahead of time to see what the potential truck routes would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7133.385s">Because</a> in my opinion, they would be cutting through many neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7137.37s">And</a> I think that's extremely important for us to know, as a council, the impact this may have on surrounding neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7146.539s">And</a> that leads to my other point that <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7151.363s">I</a> think, Mr. President, before we move forward with this, this would require community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7157.785s">And</a> I realize this is a council meeting and it's open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7161.807s">However,</a> it's the first time it's appeared on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7165.108s">And</a> I think the neighborhood where this is, I realized there was a baking facility there on a smaller scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7175.691s">I</a> think this is going to have a much larger impact on the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7180.615s">And,</a> you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7182.947s">Haines</a> Square and so forth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7185.468s">So</a> I would ask that we have a public meeting on this where we invite the Wellington, Haines Square area, Mr. President, and notify them of what is taking place to see if residents would have any particular questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7201.58s">There's</a> a host of questions that I rather do in committee of the whole regarding, I could just tell you first hand, I go to that Wendy's. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7211.366s">I</a> hate to say it, quite often. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7214.929s">And</a> I can tell you at night, Mr. President, that the rats are rampant in that back area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7220.934s">If</a> you want to check out rats, go by the back of the Wendy's. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7225.898s">And</a> so there's a lot of issues regarding, and I'm sure these are addressed by the company, but there are a lot of issues I'm sure residents are going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7235.126s">I</a> know my colleagues already asked about odor and smell and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7238.809s">We've</a> had a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7240.91s">Mr.</a> President, with docking stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7244.911s">We've</a> experienced them in Salt Method with the Dunkin' Donuts that has a distributor off of Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7251.253s">And</a> even though businesses say they're quiet, when you take pallets to and from the trucks, especially if they're outdoor docking stations, that noise travels. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7262.597s">And</a> as you know, we just built 145 condos behind the Wendy's in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7269.504s">We</a> have residents off to the left, which is right next to BJ, which is probably 100, 200 yards away, a couple hundred yards away. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7278.412s">So</a> there's definitely a neighborhood in that area, Mr. President, and I would ask that we set up a committee of whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7285.158s">or</a> if we want to have a next council meeting, serve as a public meeting to invite the neighborhood, Mr. President, and area residents so they can have input and see this presentation and ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7299.128s">And</a> I appreciate also the fact that the administration is looking into bringing in additional businesses in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7308.65s">I've</a> always stated the Office of Community Development is supposed to be out there soliciting new businesses into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7314.972s">So</a> a TIF is another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7317.172s">Would</a> I rather do it differently and not give any incentive? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7320.713s">And</a> I probably would prefer that, Mr. President, but that remains a vote of this council and to see how this works. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7329.795s">So</a> far, the last TIF I voted for, which was the sausage establishment on 9th Street, seems to be running very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7340.519s">They're</a> a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7341.659s">They're</a> located within a residential area, but there were a lot of issues on that TIF that we had to work out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7350.262s">A</a> lot of neighborhood issues, as this gentleman mentioned, with the silos, noise, trucking, trucks that are idling. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7358.365s">It</a> always happens, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7360.047s">The</a> BJ parking lot, which is a giant parking lot right next to this building, go there at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7365.632s">There's</a> 18 wheelers idling there at night, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7369.056s">Maybe</a> not trying to get it to BJ's, but just a place to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7372.659s">Also,</a> Mr. President, the city just approved a gas station for the BJ's parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7377.784s">So</a> we're going to add a brand new gas station with, I believe, eight pumps located right in the frontage on Middlesex Ave of a new gas station there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7388.051s">So</a> there's a lot going on in this area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7390.752s">And</a> to be quite frank, Middlesex Ave is deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7396.296s">The</a> sidewalks, the street, it looks like a third world country. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7400.639s">It</a> really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7401.579s">It's</a> deplorable, it's a state owned road, it gets zero attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7406.337s">from</a> the state, and Natural History City has zero responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7410.322s">So</a> if we do move forward, Mr. President, and the TIF is with the state and so forth, I'd like to see a commitment from the state to do some work, Mr. President, on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7422.118s">And</a> bring it up to the 21st century regarding crossings, pedestrian safety, cars, and everything else, Mr. President, bike lanes, and everything else that needs to take place on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7433.524s">So</a> I would ask that, Mr. President, I am not going to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7437.446s">That</a> doesn't mean I don't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7439.447s">I</a> want neighborhood input and I want the questions to be asked about the roadway and neighborhood concerns addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7449.712s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9204.867s">that</a> we provide in the reverse 911 call, a description of the project, a very brief description and the intent and how to get onto the Zoom call, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9217.31s">So</a> we can do that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9222.511s">That's</a> the way I would prefer it rather than the committee of the whole.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9761.356s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I know myself and other members of this council, I believe Councilor Morell put this on within the last couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9770.621s">Asking</a> for an update of our Massport Community Advisory Committee, who have been doing yeoman's work, representing this community for issues that are confronting the noise pollution that we experience on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9787.388s">Recently</a> we received a response from a representative to the MCAC who is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9798.707s">Peter</a> Hauk is our representative, he's been doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9802.47s">But</a> Mr. President, the reason why I bring this up is he made a recommendation of this council and also for our state and federal delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9812.759s">And</a> I want to make sure, because this council has been on top of this issue for many years now, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9820.085s">back</a> in 2010, and then back in 2016 when the MIT study was initiated to look at departure and arrival procedures at Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9831.475s">And</a> how to more equitably find solutions to dispersing flight traffic over the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9838.801s">As</a> was stated in my resolution on August 14th, 2020, the North Regional Administrator for the FAA, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9847.788s">sent</a> a letter to Massport Community Advisory Committee stating that they were no longer going to look at the dispersion proposals that came out of the MIT study. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9859.155s">So</a> that was a big hit to us as a community, because we were really counting on having at least someone from the FAA consider how to ease up and disperse some of the flights that are impacting our community so daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9874.605s">On</a> October 15th, the leaderships in Method, Cambridge, Arlington, and Malden responded to the FAA, their feasibility assessment with a request back to the FAA to earnestly and promptly apply the considerable resources at its disposal to propose an alternative departure procedure for runway 33L that would disperse jet noise more equitably. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9901.265s">So</a> that was sent out on behalf of the four communities, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9906.308s">Then</a> on October 21st, six members of the federal delegation sent a letter to the FAA regional administrator reinforcing the October 15th letter sent by the municipalities and their proposed ideas to reduce overflight noise over the city of Medford and the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9928.36s">So</a> I just ask, Mr. President, in follow up to the response that we received from Peter Hulk, dated November 16th, 2020, that we request that our state and federal delegation commit to reinforce the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9948.925s">That</a> noise concentration has created permanent problem that will not go away until the FAA addresses the problem with a procedure change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9957.169s">So</a> I would ask that we send that to our local delegation as well as our federal delegation, Mr. President, asking that they keep up the request to make sure that the FAA and Massport realize <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9974.016s">that</a> this is considerable noise, pollution, and destruction to the quality of life for area residents, and that we stay on top of the issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9985.922s">And</a> I appreciate, once again, our representatives on the MCAC for their due diligence, Mr. President, and their foresight on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9998.107s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10303.868s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10305.409s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10307.09s">And</a> I want to thank you for setting up that meeting and inviting all the city players to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10314.955s">It</a> was a great meeting and my council colleagues couldn't ask better questions to get results on behalf of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10323.34s">I</a> would just ask that we do set up the follow-up meeting because that was our commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10327.903s">to</a> the neighborhood and also I know we met at the corner of Fulton Spring and Fern, but there were a number of other hotspot areas going up Fulton Spring Road that also need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10342.313s">And</a> I'm hoping that on this next meeting, we can start picking away little by little on some of the other areas and staying on top of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10351.579s">And</a> I just want to thank my colleagues for taking a Saturday out and going down there and thank the residents for coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10358.524s">I</a> firmly believe we have to do more of that because I think it's a good way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10366.308s">We</a> can talk and talk and talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10368.029s">It's</a> a good way of getting issues addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10371.071s">We</a> bring the department heads and actually witness firsthand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10375.073s">How</a> many cars do we see roll through that four way stop?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10380.056s">Many,</a> we could have given out 100 tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10383.598s">Mr.</a> President, it was really, it was a dangerous area, but we slowed them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10387.88s">There</a> were so many of us, we actually slowed them down, but I think it shows you what's happening in our community, in every neighborhood of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10395.824s">So</a> I thank you for your leadership, Mr. President, and look forward to the upcoming meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10536.563s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10537.383s">Yes,</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10538.583s">I</a> would just ask that the entire council be named on both those papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10544.785s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10565.265s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10566.326s">This</a> truly is a big loss for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10570.007s">You</a> know, Sandy was one of the first people I met in public office back some 26 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10580.572s">And</a> you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler person that just, for many years she served as the Program Administrator for the Early Child Care Program within the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10596.342s">She</a> was just a sweetheart of a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10599.064s">She</a> was devoted to her family and friends, a truly loving mother, wife, sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10605.65s">And</a> what I didn't know about Sandy, and she was a woman of many talents, she was an accomplished and published poet, which I never knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10615.479s">And</a> she was an accomplished world traveler. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10619.222s">And,</a> you know, she really is, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10623.29s">There's</a> going to be a hole in this community that's missing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10626.932s">Because</a> when you lose someone of that character, someone of that stature, someone that put kids first, I don't know if you can recover from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10638.319s">And</a> I just want to, on behalf of the city council, wish her family well and her husband Rick, who we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10648.765s">I</a> wish him well, Mr. President, in this very difficult time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10745.707s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10747.268s">For</a> those that have been around this city for a number of years, Ralph Surrett was our faithful cameraman for a lot of years in this corner room. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10756.871s">You</a> probably never saw him because he was very behind the scenes, never wanted any public light, was truly a kind, gentle man when you talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10770.155s">He'd</a> always tell you about what's going on in local news and he was a real animal lover and someone that was an advocate for animals within this community and a graduate of the Medford Vocational School and someone that <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10787.305s">was</a> a true Methodite for a lot of years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10791.388s">And</a> on behalf of his family, I want to dedicate this meeting and dedication to Ralph Surrett for his many years of service to this community and to the Method City Council, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_WziW6Oj7skY/2024-11-19_WziW6Oj7skY.html">City Council 11-24-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=177.038s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=178.4s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=179.921s">I</a> put this on the agenda, Mr. President, it's been some time now since this council has approved municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=188.707s">I've</a> received a number of calls from residents that are pleased with the aggregation and other residents that are questioning why their bills are so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=198.494s">So</a> I thought it was only appropriate now that we revisit the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=203.977s">see</a> how the program is running, Mr. President, see if there's anything needed, maybe to update residents of this community, or if there's anything we can do as a community to improve the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=214.386s">So</a> I believe we have Alicia Hunt on the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=217.369s">Yes,</a> she is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=218.77s">On</a> the Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=220.231s">So</a> at this time, Mr. President, I will yield to Alicia.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=655.087s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=659.408s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=660.308s">I</a> want to thank Alicia for her presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=662.989s">That</a> was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=664.869s">I</a> would ask that while this program goes forward, that we receive quarterly updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=671.391s">I</a> think that would be extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=673.931s">Alicia,</a> my question to you is, just so we're comparing apples with apples. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=680.273s">I'm</a> trying to compare someone that opted out of the program, that stayed on National Grid, compared to if they were to go on to the program for the same period of time with DiEnergy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=695.278s">And</a> you're saying to me the average difference over a period of time is $0.04?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=725.162s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=725.682s">So,</a> so that's an average. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=727.904s">So,</a> so that's an average. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=729.005s">So</a> naturally there are some residents that paid less than $4. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=734.008s">And</a> some that paid more than four. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=735.598s">Do</a> we know how much more than four?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=851.954s">So</a> just fill me in because it's been some time, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=856.598s">If</a> I opted out of the program and someone that's currently in the program wants to go back and forth, how easy is it to go back and forth, opt in and opt out of the program?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=942.745s">Right,</a> so from what you're telling me, that was going to be my other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=947.226s">As</a> a community, we're not allowed to advise our residents as you just stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=952.748s">You</a> said, jeez, if everyone's in the program now, I would ask you to stay in the program because the contractor's rates are going to be far better than national grid's rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=962.97s">So</a> what you did was just advise people to stay in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=967.111s">And</a> you're saying that's something that we really shouldn't be doing as a community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=997.426s">So</a> how would one, when you say, look at these differences, I realize you're showing us the presentation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1004.029s">How</a> would one know this to actually take advantage?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1040.032s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1040.853s">Do</a> we provide a chart similar to this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1055.936s">So</a> do you think we would be in violation if we were to share this particular graph with residents?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1067.82s">Right,</a> and the reason why I say it is, and the reason why I think it's important to give quarterly updates, is that we have consultants that are working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1077.706s">And</a> why not be able to benefit from their knowledge to spread that out to the community to allow them to make an informed decision whether they want to come and go from a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1088.493s">And</a> I can appreciate the fact that our numbers are based on enrollment, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1092.616s">Because</a> if the numbers drop too low, we're probably not going to get the same rate, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1127.813s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1128.633s">So</a> for the time being, I didn't know we were locked in until 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1133.615s">And</a> it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1135.336s">Enrollment</a> doesn't matter for that period of time, which is great news for us, because there's no bottom line on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1144.639s">So</a> my question again is, why aren't we promoting this as a program to show when the best time to get on and off the program is? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1155.082s">You're</a> saying we can't do that legally?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1266.973s">So</a> when you say that number, how does that compare to prior to aggregation? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1273.835s">Because</a> anyone could have opted for green options prior to aggregation, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1281.17s">I</a> didn't quite question council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1284.654s">So</a> you mentioned 3.6 million, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1288.519s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1289.12s">And</a> that's what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1291.443s">Additional</a> 3.6 million with aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1294.967s">Prior</a> to aggregation, where were we as a community? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1298.972s">Do</a> we know those numbers?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1331.691s">Well,</a> just if I could, so prior to municipal aggregation, I'm under the impression that people were allowed to get additional green energy if they opted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1342.94s">So</a> before municipal energy came into, aggregation came into the community, there were people buying green energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1351.944s">Is</a> that not correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1365.437s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1365.997s">And</a> we don't know what that figure was then in our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1470.132s">So,</a> Mr. President, I'd like to make a motion at this point that the city <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1478.241s">interact</a> with our rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1481.744s">And</a> our city provide information relative to, like we've seen the chart tonight, relative to where the market is and where the rates are over a given span of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1495.153s">So</a> people are allowed to make informed decisions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1498.895s">So</a> I would ask that that be part of the website and part of any type of outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1504.777s">I</a> have yet to see any outreach since December 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1508.178s">It's</a> not to say it hasn't happened, but I have yet to see any outreach letting the community know where we stand with municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1517.2s">This</a> was a very large endeavor when we instituted this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1522.322s">And</a> I find it ironic that <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1527.463s">You</a> need a buy-in into the program, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1529.889s">They're</a> saying, well, look how many of these people signed up for the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1532.776s">But</a> this was an opt. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1535.305s">You</a> had to opt out of the program, so everyone was automatically opt into the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1541.229s">So</a> if it wasn't for the legislation that allowed for that, Mr. President, the numbers may not be this large. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1548.134s">So</a> I think the program started off with the ability to have everyone automatically enrolled and then those that wanted to get out of it, which is a little different than <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1559.802s">the</a> way I would personally handle it, but that's how the state legislature decided to implement this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1567.285s">But</a> I would ask that as a community, Mr. President, that we do a better job notifying residents where we stand from quarter to quarter or maybe six month period, whatever Alicia feels would be beneficial to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1583.813s">So</a> they can make informed decisions when they want to opt in and opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1589.675s">And</a> the other point, Mr. President, is if when this contract does end in 2022, that maybe they can put an ending period where they stop providing that information, maybe three or six months prior to the end of the contract, because you don't want the volatility. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1609.005s">I</a> can see that with people coming in and out of it towards the end of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1613.527s">So</a> I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1617.209s">It</a> doesn't seem to me that that would be <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1619.31s">a</a> violation of the contract, just updating our residents and alerting them when the best time to be on municipal aggregation in the interest of their pocketbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1629.64s">Also,</a> Mr. President, if I could, the residents that I heard from, I didn't see any of their bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1635.826s">But</a> some of the information I was receiving was not $4 for <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1643.153s">It</a> was far more than that that they were paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1646.235s">And</a> I didn't do a real deep dive into it, but some of them were hundreds of dollars that they feel that they were paying more with this new municipal aggregation compared to last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1657.746s">And</a> it could be a change in, maybe they did use more air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1661.969s">I</a> don't know, I didn't do a deep dive, but there were many residents that did reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1666.393s">because</a> I was vocal with municipal aggregation, asking why their bill was that much higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1671.554s">And</a> it wasn't $4, it was a lot more than $4.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1724.943s">John,</a> can you provide us with your contact information?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1877.587s">By</a> way of that graph that was presented to us, that was extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1880.829s">I</a> mean, it's somewhat easy to look at and make a determination.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=1901.38s">I</a> am all set.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2702.459s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2703.32s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2705.882s">As</a> Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, November 19th, this Method City Council received an email from the mayor outlining her concern regarding the council tabling her paper, which was a $740,000 supplemental to this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2726.658s">which</a> added several positions and some other odd items, Mr. President, within this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2734.181s">The</a> council did have some questions regarding some of the positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2738.423s">We</a> asked for job descriptions and we also asked that we address an issue that a longstanding issue this council has been talking about regarding hiring of the election coordinator position to assist <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2753.409s">in</a> the clerk's office with running these very important elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2757.853s">Since</a> then, Mr. President, we received this email on November 19th because the paper was tabled and the mayor within the paper mentioned that this 9-1-1 position for supervisor is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2773.405s">And</a> as my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, that actually raised my eyebrows, Mr. President, because I have yet to hear anything about an emergency taking place at our 911 center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2787.48s">The</a> mayor went on to state that she met just recently with the dispatchers, members of the fire and police departments, and both chiefs of the police and fire, as well as Lieutenant Rudolph, who we heard make a presentation a couple weeks back regarding, I guess he is the oversight now of <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2811.445s">So</a> based on the mayor's letter and the fact that she mentions the position as an emergency, she stated in the letter that it's a critical need for the operation of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2825.253s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate that we as a council are aware if there is a critical need with 911, <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2834.118s">which</a> is vital to the function and safety of our residents, that we should be at least privy to what's going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2843.605s">It</a> also mentioned that the mayor is bringing in someone to assist with the development of a unified training manual, rules, policies, procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2855.134s">and</a> chain of command protocol. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2858.557s">Now,</a> this operation for 911 with civilians has been in place for a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2865.021s">If</a> unified training manual does not exist, if rules, policies, and procedures and command protocol doesn't exist for a year and a half, maybe there is a serious problem, Mr. President, that we should be made aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2878.712s">So</a> that really alarms me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2882.394s">I</a> think this resolution is calling to get information regarding what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2887.738s">When</a> this was presented, the $740,000 to address several positions of which one was the supervisor of the 911 center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2898.025s">There</a> was never one iota, not one mention of this grave of a concern in the 911 center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2906.31s">of</a> an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2907.39s">Not</a> one mention, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2909.071s">Maybe</a> my other colleagues heard it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2910.872s">I</a> didn't hear any mention of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2913.152s">I</a> also had a conversation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2915.133s">I</a> picked up the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2916.413s">I</a> reached out to the union representative for the dispatches. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2921.588s">Officer</a> Harold McGillivray, he's also the union representative for the Patrolmen's Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2927.173s">And</a> I asked him point blank, are you aware of any emergency that's taking place right now for public safety within 911? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2935.802s">And</a> he stated to me, Mr. President, and he could speak for his own, he's very eloquent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2940.406s">He</a> said, I am unaware of any public safety emergency happening currently at the 911 center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2948.198s">So</a> that flies in the face with the November 19th email we received. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2953.181s">Unless</a> that email is nothing but a scare tactic to get us to vote for a paper that, in my opinion, was flawed, Mr. President, and didn't address some of the concerns that we as a council had. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2965.608s">So</a> I hope we get some answers, Mr. President, from the two chiefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2971.611s">I'd</a> like to hear what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2973.172s">Maybe</a> this may require, because we're talking about sensitive public safety information, maybe an executive session next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2980.595s">Who</a> knows, but we have to be prepared if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2984.057s">Because</a> I refuse to sit here and hear once again that we can't discuss concerns of public safety like we did a month ago regarding a breach of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2996.362s">from</a> city and school employees where private information was taken, Mr. President, and that we couldn't discuss it as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3005.644s">We</a> couldn't go into executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3007.425s">We</a> couldn't find out anything about this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3009.985s">And</a> I'm not going to sit around and sit back, Mr. President, when I'm hearing from the mayor that there's an emergency within 911 call center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3018.868s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3399.362s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3401.383s">If</a> we are going to invite Lieutenant Rudolph, I would ask that the union representative be invited as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3407.825s">That</a> represents the dispatches. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3411.286s">And</a> that would be Officer Harold McGillivray.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3455.528s">Further</a> amended by myself, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3466.617s">It</a> was to invite the union representative who represents the dispatches.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4404.362s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4405.262s">I</a> appreciate Councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4409.624s">I</a> do have a number of questions and I'm not sure if it's appropriate tonight, but it's my understanding level three sex offenders have to register with the local police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4420.81s">Has</a> that happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4423.251s">Is</a> there a loophole for long term facilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4425.733s">Is</a> that not a requirement if someone is a level two or three sex offender? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4431.276s">And</a> are they required to report? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4434.158s">That's</a> state statute that requires the reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4437.44s">And</a> it's an offense not to report. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4439.982s">So</a> I was just wondering if that took place or if there's a loophole within the statute that doesn't require for these type of facilities.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4488.149s">Right,</a> so if that's the case, Mr. President, as was stated earlier, that the state statute also requires that these level sex offenders not only report, but be a certain distance away from schools, and churches, and parks, and a number of items, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4504.204s">I</a> don't have it in front of me, but I know it spells out a number of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4507.887s">And</a> who is the responsibility to oversee that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4511.61s">Is</a> it our police department to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4514.733s">because</a> you can go on the website and see where level two and level three sex offenders are within your community currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4521.735s">And</a> there are pretty stringent requirements also that as long as they report, Mr. President, you're not supposed to harass, <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4533.199s">do</a> anything against these offenders as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4537.482s">So</a> they have protections as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4540.864s">However,</a> if they're in violation of state statute because they're too close to an area where they're prohibited to be, that's a major concern of. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4549.65s">of</a> us as a community, and I think one that, as Mr. Rodriguez, the Chief of Staff, mentioned, if there is a lag, we've got to figure out why is there a lag and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4560.582s">I</a> put on the agenda a while back, and I'm hoping we have a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4564.266s">I</a> know we've had a lot, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4567.109s">But</a> I asked for a public safety summit regarding the incident that Councilor Caraviello mentioned about a senior citizen in this community that was assaulted by someone from a group home within the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4581.136s">And</a> it turned out actually to be <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4585.718s">better</a> than expected because of this senior's ability to get out of the home and find safety, but it could have been a very dangerous, dangerous situation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4596.526s">And</a> I asked for a public safety summit, and maybe this is another issue that we can put on that agenda and discuss these particular concerns that we have in the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4607.934s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5790.468s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5797.307s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I just want to say that was a very fruitful meeting, and I want to thank Chairman Scarpelli for calling that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5806.256s">After</a> all these years, Mr. President, of this council barking about the dangerousness of that particular intersection, we have a lot of them around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5816.748s">But</a> that one in particular, South and Main, Mr. President, it was very pleasing to hear from the project manager from DOT, Mike Trepanier, who from what I hear is a very capable person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5829.571s">And</a> when he's in charge of something, it gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5833.112s">So</a> I was very pleased to hear that he is responsible for moving this project forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5839.134s">He</a> mentioned it's the intersection program that's part of a federal funded program where design dollars come from MassDOT and construction funding comes from MassDOT as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5851.603s">And</a> as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, they're looking at a three to five year potential program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5861.37s">And</a> we asked on multiple occasions, the three committee members, that we were looking for some immediate resolve to some of the concerns that have been mentioned by this council regarding raised crosswalks, additional signage, a traffic light at that particular intersection, some low-lying foot for temporary public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5885.15s">And</a> from what we heard from the city engine,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5897.795s">So</a> I'm very pleased to hear that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5901.416s">And</a> one thing I did find interesting is over the years, we've always been told that the intersection of Maine and South was under state control. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5915.587s">And</a> when the gentleman from DOT mentioned that this is kind of outside their boundary, I questioned him and said, what do you mean this is your road? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5924.98s">And</a> come to find out, someone from the state made an additional call to <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5934.39s">And</a> district four said there's some cross sectional lines in that particular location. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5939.695s">So</a> it's not clear cut that it's state versus city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5943.398s">And</a> I think some of that, according to my conversation with the traffic engineer, I think still needs to be ironed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5949.924s">But</a> I was very pleased to hear that DOT is going to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5954.307s">as</a> a total approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5956.108s">They're</a> not looking at that intersection as they mentioned all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5959.869s">They're</a> looking at from Salem Street all the way down to High Street, going towards Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5965.771s">And</a> the signalization, the whole length, which makes sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5970.473s">And</a> I also want to thank our city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5974.134s">If</a> you want to read the minutes that were put out by the city clerk, it's really like you attended the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5982.526s">It's</a> amazing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5984.708s">Extremely</a> detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5986.529s">And</a> it's extremely, the reason why I bring it up is not to give accolades to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5991.472s">These</a> are the records that will go by, the minutes, someday when, in a year from now, when they say, we didn't say this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5997.976s">We're</a> going to have it in writing, Mr. President, the commitments that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6002.099s">during</a> that particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6003.6s">And</a> I think it's going to go a long way, so I want to thank Chairman Scarpelli, Councilor Morell that was on the call that asked a number of good questions, and the City Clerk, Mr. President, for his detailed notes on the meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6478.928s">Mr.</a> President, and to the one thing you can count on this time of year, right around the holidays, especially Thanksgiving, is the generosity in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6489.712s">And</a> one person that stands out, and I don't want to put them on the spot, but Councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6495.635s">Every</a> year, Mr. President, this isn't Johnny come lately. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6498.678s">He's</a> been doing this for years and years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6501.801s">And</a> he's the first to stand out there and help local families, Mr. President, those that may not even ask for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6508.306s">He</a> is the first to get out there and dedicate himself, Mr. President, and put up his own, Mr. President, his own resources on many occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6518.935s">And</a> I just want to personally thank him on behalf of the many people in this community.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3aghgs5t794/2024-11-19_3aghgs5t794.html">City Council 11-17-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=568.813s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and I appreciate the due diligence of the administration providing the job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=576.703s">It</a> was helpful, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=579.387s">The</a> issue at hand that I had last week, as Mr. Rodriguez just mentioned, was regarding the <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=587.375s">I</a> feel, and I won't speak for my other colleagues, that this is an issue that's been discussed at least for the last two to two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=596.838s">There's</a> a need in the community to have someone coordinate our elections, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=601.939s">We've</a> been very fortunate to have a great staff and a clerk that oversees the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=609.18s">However,</a> Mr. President, we're at a point right now with early voting, mail-in voting, absentee voting, <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=616.362s">And</a> our voting rolls have increased over the last number of years, I believe by almost 10,000 new voters in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=628.247s">That</a> in my opinion, and I'd like to hear from the city clerk, that this position is well warranted within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=637.531s">And</a> I think we should get all the stakeholders, I agree, at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=642.512s">However,</a> Mr. President, this is two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=646.113s">And</a> I appreciate the commitment from the administration to take 100,000 out of the facilities, but I would like to have a time frame on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=654.555s">I</a> believe a job description has been drafted, sent to the appropriate personnel within the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=663.397s">And</a> if we can arrive at some type of time frame, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=667.458s">I</a> will give it my support tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=669.539s">If</a> not, Mr. President, I am tired of lip service. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=673.78s">Not</a> to say that that's the case here, but I am tired of lip service. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=677.741s">And</a> I want to see action, especially on such an important position in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=683.803s">If</a> we can't guarantee to residents in this community that we can have a fair election, Mr. President, and an election that we know is <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=693.306s">On</a> the utmost regarding security safety, then we're not doing what we were supposed to be doing as elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=701.995s">And</a> I believe having this position would secure that, Mr. President, and it would secure us for a number of years moving forward as we see elections changing, not only in Method, but across the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=713.066s">So</a> at this point, I'd like to ask the city clerk, because this is not something we just want to create a position on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=720.228s">This</a> is something that's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=722.289s">And</a> I'd like to hear from the chief election officer in the community that's been overseeing the process for the last two years, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=835.762s">Can</a> you just speak to the particular need?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1017.035s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Clerk, and if I could just follow up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1021.138s">It's</a> my understanding, and I think I mentioned this last week, that some many years ago, there used to be two separate positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1028.503s">It</a> was the city clerk position and elections coordinator position that existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1033.926s">The</a> person in the election coordinator position, from my understanding, retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1038.87s">And</a> rather than looking for another election coordinator position, the city clerk took it on as a stipend position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1045.534s">And</a> that's where we fell for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1048.117s">And</a> I can guarantee you in all the surrounding communities that the city clerk is not the person that's in charge or coordinates the elections in all the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1060.371s">That</a> is a separate and distinct function and role and separate person. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1065.717s">And</a> I think we're at a point right now in this community and the size of this community that this is warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1070.32s">I</a> don't believe anyone in the administration doesn't believe so either. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1074.242s">But</a> I want to make sure, Mr. President, that we're not here another year from now talking about the same issue and putting our resources into the same things over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1084.788s">So</a> that's why I'm hoping if we can get a commitment tonight on when we will see this position, I'll give the administration all the needed time they need to meet with the stakeholders and parties and draft the job description and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1097.991s">But</a> we need a time frame, Mr. President, that someone will be in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1102.552s">And</a> that's how I will vote for this tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1146.905s">No,</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1148.788s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1685.135s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1686.596s">And</a> this paper was on the agenda a week ago, and we sent back last Tuesday a message to the administration, and I believe the chief of staff was on the meeting last week with this council's intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1701.66s">And</a> to come back and say that he has no authority to make any decisions as the chief of staff, I think falls short of the mark, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1712.531s">Because</a> clearly the council made it known what our intent was last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1717.296s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Knight, however, the paper was presented the way it was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1722.039s">I</a> don't think we can go through this and pick and choose what items we'd like to move forward with and what items we'd like to sit on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1729.304s">I</a> don't believe we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1730.444s">If</a> the administration wants to recall this, <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1734.447s">paper</a> and then submit another paper that we can agree upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1738.272s">Ideally,</a> Mr. President, it would have been nice for the administration maybe to sit down in a committee of the whole at the council and say, hey, look, we have $740,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1747.284s">These</a> are the things we'd like to do in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1750.708s">What</a> are your thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1752.09s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1752.61s">That</a> didn't happen, and so be it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1756.571s">But</a> clearly, I am not going to commit because the administration's unwilling to commit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1763.752s">Because</a> from what I'm hearing tonight, there is no commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1767.073s">You</a> can wait your 45 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1768.993s">They</a> can come out with ten different job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1771.574s">There's</a> still no commitment to fund this position, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1776.555s">And</a> just because they come out with a job description doesn't make me feel warm and fuzzy that that's a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1782.037s">That</a> is not a commitment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1784.018s">Been</a> around a long time, and that is not a formal commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1787.059s">And</a> I think we heard that here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1788.82s">So</a> as we stated before, if the council feels this is necessary, Mr. President, we stand up, send the paper back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1796.663s">So</a> if that's the will of the council, I will follow that, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2024.853s">Councilor</a> Marks, would you like to- Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the representative from National Grid being on the call again tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2033.025s">The</a> question I think which was supported by this council, Mr. President, was to have Diana go back to National Grid regarding putting together some mitigation to address curbing in the area of Riverside Ave that this construction work was going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2052.359s">I</a> think the total construction paving and marking, according to the representative from National Grid, was about $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2060.321s">We</a> by no means were looking for mitigation to that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2064.563s">However,</a> we were looking to address the lack of the appropriate height of curbing on Riverside Ave, which currently right now is level with the street and very dangerous to pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2077.146s">So</a> I would like to just find out what Diana came back with regarding her conversation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2279.2s">And</a> for the pipes, valves, governors, manholes, and structures, fixtures, and appearances designed- Mr. President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading, and if the representative from National Grid can give a brief synopsis of the request.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3169.5s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3173.501s">This</a> was a real big shock, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3176.442s">Leo</a> was always very spunky. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3177.942s">He'd</a> be the first to give a good word and also tell you the truth on something, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3183.183s">He</a> didn't hold back any punches when you talked to Leo. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3185.804s">He'll</a> tell you how it was, and as Councilor Caraviello put it so eloquently, he was involved in a lot of different things in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3195.187s">But</a> what stands out to me is the involvement, those late night meetings that we used to have with the Democratic Warded City Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3202.629s">He</a> would be out on every issue supporting his cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3206.11s">He</a> was a man of, really, of integrity and someone you can count on as a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3213.673s">And</a> he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3338.113s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3341.385s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3342.205s">Anyone</a> that knew Trieste knew him as a real family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3347.147s">Married</a> for many, many decades to his wife, Lucy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3351.508s">They</a> were always together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3353.908s">Trieste</a> was a loving husband, a loving father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3360.91s">And</a> they were a staple, he was a staple in Salt Method for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3365.311s">A</a> family very involved in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3368.013s">And</a> he will be solely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3371.978s">I</a> would ask if we could, in honor of him, that this meeting be dedicated in Trieste Silvio's name, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3627.221s">I</a> review the records, find them to be in order, and move approval, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3735.782s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to stress, it's extremely important that when we meet as a council to discuss neighborhood concerns, public safety concerns, that we get a buy-in from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3754.294s">And</a> it's extremely important that all the parties <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3759.457s">that</a> can make substantial change in this community be present, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3763.278s">So</a> I would be extremely disappointed if we didn't see the leadership in this committee, this community, show up to this particular Committee of the Whole meeting when we're discussing very important issues up the heights, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_TKixPlxrhGc/2024-11-19_TKixPlxrhGc.html">City Council 11-10-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1374.053s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1374.954s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for following up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1379.677s">These</a> type of presentations, in my opinion, are extremely important and aren't done frequently enough to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1386.822s">So</a> I appreciate Councilor Knight following up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1389.844s">My</a> question is twofold. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1392.725s">First,</a> what <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1395.532s">regarding</a> the capital plan is part of this current budget now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1401.675s">So</a> anything that's in the capital plan, what would be expended out of the current budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1407.657s">Or</a> do we anticipate bonding for everything?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1475.837s">Right,</a> so online to what Councilor Bears mentioned, do we have any idea what percent of this $740,000 would be actually items that would be part of the capital plan?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1504.649s">So</a> this $740,000 would be an integral part of moving forward with a five- or six-year capital plan?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1526.813s">So</a> why are we taking this approach that we haven't seen a capital plan but we're moving forward with items that may or may not be part of the capital plan?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1563.749s">And</a> the reason why we're moving forward now, although we just did the budget four months ago, is that this newfound money is giving us the ability to progress on some of the issues that the city needs to move forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1580.182s">Is</a> that why we're looking at this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1594.579s">So</a> my other point, and I think you're right with some of these concerns, and I do support many of the items in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1604.365s">And</a> when we get to this paper, I have other questions on this paper itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1609.168s">But</a> regarding some of these positions, there's been long discussion, not just this particular year with the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1618.554s">that</a> the elections department just went through, but for the past several years, this city has requested an election coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1628.058s">We</a> currently don't have someone that coordinates our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1632.099s">We</a> do have a city clerk that wears multiple hats, but he is not an elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1639.562s">And</a> all the surrounding cities and towns that I looked into have that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1644.904s">And</a> for some reason, the city of Medford, with a city of almost 60,000 people and 41,000 registered voters, we don't have someone that coordinates our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1656.607s">And</a> I think that's a shortfall in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1660.248s">And</a> with everything going on nationally, that it's very important that <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1666.67s">We</a> have someone that can make sure the integrity of our election is what everyone would come to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1675.237s">So</a> have we looked into, I know this council has put forward several, and I know I've put forward a couple, and I know my colleagues have, several requests for the city administration to hire an elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1687.907s">I</a> believe the mayor has sat down and has discussed the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1693.272s">Can</a> you give us an update? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1694.893s">where</a> we stand with an election coordinator, and why it's not part of this list here.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1723.123s">Right,</a> but those are one-time funds, and I'm talking about a long-term plan in the community to have oversight within a very important department. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1734.589s">And</a> I think when this list that we're going to go over soon that was presented to us, this is to help the city move forward on some shortfalls that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1744.675s">or</a> shortcomings, I should say, in how we operate city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1749.68s">And</a> in my opinion, election coordinators should be at the top of the list, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1755.486s">So</a> I would hope that we can get some answers tonight on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1822.015s">Okay,</a> so and I appreciate that response, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1826.499s">It's</a> my understanding that a fair amount of work over the past two years has already gone into what this petition position would <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1837.978s">be</a> created for what purpose, the duties and responsibilities, the actual job title, who they would oversee, the responsibilities, the salary and the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1850.705s">So</a> I think a lot of the legwork that you just mentioned has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1854.367s">So</a> to hear that this is something that we're going to look at once again after the election seems to be, with all due respect, more lip service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1865.133s">So</a> in order to get my support for this particular paper, and I don't know where my colleagues stand, but I can tell you we've all reiterated this over and over and over again ad nauseum. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1877.704s">I</a> will not support a paper that doesn't include an election coordinator position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1882.548s">And</a> you can work out the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1885.011s">The</a> facilities manager, I haven't seen the job description other than the title and the salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1892.501s">I</a> don't know anything else about that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1895.299s">But</a> it found its way in this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1897.48s">And</a> I would think, in my opinion, that there's been more homework and due diligence done already for the election coordinator position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1906.324s">The</a> need's there, the demand is there, and the integrity of our elections is extremely important in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1913.707s">And</a> to have someone facilitate and pull this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1917.807s">I</a> think is vital in this community, extremely vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1922.191s">So</a> I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1924.713s">I</a> will not support this paper unless the paper includes the election coordinator position that this council has voted on, I believe unanimously, a half a dozen times in the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1937.024s">And</a> I'll let my colleagues speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1938.645s">So</a> I just want to let you know where I stand on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1962.998s">I</a> believe it's out there, so we will get you a copy of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1966.159s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1968.7s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3647.855s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3648.976s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3650.877s">I</a> think he hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3653.499s">As</a> a member of this council, I would like to see Mr. President for any newly created position, which this request has several, that we receive a full job description on the position itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3668.469s">I</a> realize that the city administration probably put a lot of time and effort into this, but they have to realize we weren't privy to these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3676.199s">Secondly,</a> Mr. President, I would ask that when my colleagues are done speaking, that I would like to evoke rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3684.791s">for</a> this particular paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3685.791s">It's</a> the first time it has appeared on the council agenda and it's a financial paper and any request of a member of this council for a financial paper appearing for the first time gets automatically laid on the table for one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3699.436s">So</a> I would say when my colleagues are done speaking, I would like to evoke rule 20 Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3705.338s">I</a> would also ask that within this week that the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3710.24s">which</a> is the chief of staff, along with the mayor, sit down with the city clerk, come up with a job description for the election coordinator, a salary for the election coordinator, and what their responsibilities would be, and come back to us within a week with that title added to this particular list. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3731.587s">And</a> if there's no money for the appropriation, I would ask that it be taken from the facilities, line item of 200,000 minus whatever the salary for the election coordinator position would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3745.356s">And</a> when we receive the job description for these other positions, that we also receive a new job description for the election coordinator, Mr. President, as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4759.328s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4760.668s">If</a> I could, there was a number of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4763.809s">The</a> major question I believe was by many of the council members was why this work was taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4771.271s">Gas</a> work, first of all, during the holidays and secondly, during cold winter months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4776.773s">where</a> it potentially could impact residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4780.974s">And</a> we asked what the nature of the emergency was to do it at this particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4786.356s">So</a> I'd like to hear a response from National Grid.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4832.75s">So</a> Mr. President, that's good news as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4838.392s">Another</a> issue that I brought up, I believe it was last week or the week before, not week before because of the election, was the fact that item bullet point number 12 was the scope of the MWRA section 57 project includes the resurfacing and striping this portion of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4858.417s">The</a> engineering division requests that National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to other paving in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4866.48s">And</a> we got a commitment from our city engineer at the time that the restoration and other paving will indeed take place on Riverside Ave to make sure the curbing is brought up to standards, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4883.445s">Currently,</a> much of the curbing on Riverside Ave, in this particular project span, the curbing is level with the street, which poses a safety concern and a public safety risk for area residents that are walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4896.579s">And</a> I know that language wasn't changed, but I want to make sure that that indeed is what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4903.166s">So</a> I'm not sure if we formally need to change this scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4907.009s">of</a> service, bullet point 12, if there's a need, or if the city engineer feels that that's not necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4916.834s">I</a> know he's on the call, I thought I saw him earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4919.396s">I</a> think he did actually, let's see, so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5079.605s">So</a> Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5082.387s">And</a> I appreciate the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5085.009s">So</a> it's my understanding that the MWRA is going to pay for the resurfacing and the striping of the portion of Riverside Ave that's going to be torn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5097.958s">This</a> also states that National Grid is supposed to contribute to the final restoration project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5104.889s">Whereas</a> the MWRA is paying for it, that money that the national grid would be kicking in goes into, just say, a different pot now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5114.499s">And</a> the city engineer said, okay, we'll take that different pot and we'll use it for other paving in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5120.965s">So</a> my request two weeks ago was rather than looking at other paving areas in the city, that's put it towards Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5128.271s">We</a> know there's work that needs to be done on the curbing and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5132.115s">So</a> I can appreciate the fact that this is not part of the scope of the overall project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5139.261s">What</a> I'm asking is as a city that that money be dedicated to the curbing on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5147.307s">I</a> don't know what the actual final restoration cost is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5153.651s">So</a> is there any indication what this would cost National Grid or what money they'd be giving to the city?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5219.434s">So</a> my question to you, Mr. Engineer, is that if we were to allow the resurfacing and striping take place at this particular juncture, that would preclude us down the line for raising our curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5239.201s">Or</a> would it make it more difficult? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5242.11s">at</a> that particular point to do maybe curbing and sidewalking at a later date?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5295.094s">So</a> just so I understand, National Grid's exception to this is not the fact that we want to do curbing, it's the fact that they don't want to be involved in curbing, but the money that they give towards the project, we can put towards curbing or whatever we want to do as a community, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5431.781s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5432.821s">I</a> mean, I think we're well aware of projects like we're going through right now with 3.2 miles of Eversource coming through the community that gives <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5441.765s">zero</a> benefit to this community other than ripping up our streets, 3.2 miles of our street, and we get zero benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5450.489s">So</a> I think we can appreciate the fact that National Grid is doing this on behalf of the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5459.793s">My</a> question is then the way this is worded. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5463.315s">It</a> says the scope of the MWRA section 57 project includes resurfacing and striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5470.493s">So</a> from what I understand is the MWRA is going to pay for resurfacing and striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5475.437s">Am</a> I correct with that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5480.741s">OK,</a> just so the MWRA is paying for resurfacing and striping the portion of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5487.067s">Then</a> it goes on to say the engineering division requests that National Grid, not the MWRA, National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to other paving in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5499.997s">So</a> it's our engineering department requesting not just MWRA do their surfacing and striping, but also now that National Grid pay something towards other paving projects in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5513.886s">Is</a> that not correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5527.706s">Right,</a> but from what I'm hearing now is that the other project can't be us putting that money into curbing on Riverside F. Not National Grid, us as a community going off on our own and putting that money into curbing on Riverside F. Is that what I just not heard?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5564.003s">We</a> would replace the sidewalk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5565.864s">We</a> wouldn't just raise curbing and leave the sidewalk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5572.887s">Point</a> of information, Council of Peers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5587.931s">I'm</a> sorry, I didn't hear what Councilor Bears said.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5607.015s">OK,</a> so the request from the engineer that would be voting on tonight that states that National Grid would contribute to the final cost is now different. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5621.688s">That's</a> for Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5623.67s">Anyone</a> that wants to answer it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5632.072s">Okay,</a> so if we were gonna vote on this tonight, we're voting on this language that's in front of us, and we're hearing that they're not gonna honor this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5642.318s">That</a> is what you're hearing.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5684.722s">Right,</a> so let me, just so I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5688.963s">So</a> if we made it as a condition, this says the engineering division recommends that the grant location be approved with the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5700.387s">Now,</a> he doesn't recommend it unless it has these conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5703.868s">Am</a> I correct, Mr. Engineer?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5756.354s">From</a> who?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5782.668s">So</a> why can't National Grid go back to the MWRA and say, you know what, we applied for a permit and the city's requesting these conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5791.674s">And</a> if you want the work done, these are the conditions they're requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5796.438s">Why</a> can't that be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5799.1s">I</a> understand National Grid's the middle man, but they're the ones applying for the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5805.54s">And</a> if we're saying that we want X, Y, and Z done, these are the conditions, and National Grid says we can't do that because legally we can't obligate ourselves to fix that that way for whatever reason, they can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5818.583s">Then</a> they need to go back to the MWRA and say, this is the pushback from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5822.944s">The</a> city wants X, Y, and Z done in order for you to get this project moved forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5828.185s">I</a> don't understand why we have to back off as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5831.17s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5832.611s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Layton.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5991.483s">Exactly,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5993.483s">A</a> contribution towards that particular project that we will do as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5998.384s">We</a> weren't looking for National Grid to take on that project.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6106.897s">Mr.</a> President, I would just ask that we get a commitment tonight from National Grid that a portion of funds be allocated to curb work on Riverside F. And that could be discussed between the city engineer and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6126.067s">And</a> that's what I thought this originally was requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6129.448s">And</a> I just wanted to make sure that what the request was that it stayed on Riverside Ave, because the original request was that that money be spent somewhere else in the city for paving somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6143.335s">So</a> I understand what National Grid's stating. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6145.937s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6147.237s">I</a> would just hope they make a commitment tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6149.218s">If</a> they don't, I cannot support this paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6153.1s">based</a> on what I see in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6156.502s">I</a> don't think the city gets a fair shake, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6159.584s">Everywhere</a> you look, they're digging up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6161.745s">They're</a> a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6162.385s">They're</a> never put back the way they should be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6165.066s">You've</a> got sinkholes everywhere in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6167.268s">You've</a> got double poles all around the community, you see popping up everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6171.43s">And</a> these utility companies thumb their nose at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6174.171s">Mr.</a> President, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6176.332s">And</a> if they want to come up and move their pipes underneath the national grid, it's going to move for the MWRA, let them figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6183.454s">Let</a> them figure out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6186.194s">But</a> I'm not going to stand around, Mr. President, while we talked about these curbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6190.836s">And</a> I live off of Riverside Ave, not this general area, but I live off of Riverside Ave, and I witness, Mr. President, every time I go by there, curbs that are level with the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6200.8s">And</a> the gentleman that called me up just recently that his front stairs were totally annihilated, brick stairs at the Conner Locust and Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6210.142s">If</a> anyone remembers that, a cop plowed right into his home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6214.623s">And</a> partly because that the street is even with the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6219.085s">Partly</a> because the person was probably a bad driver, God knows what else was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6223.286s">But</a> it lends itself, Mr. President, for a very dangerous area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6227.527s">And</a> if we're going to do total work like this, that's complete the work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6231.788s">And</a> if the city has to step up and put some obligation, fine, but let's get it done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6237.03s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6685.537s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6689.418s">Mr.</a> President, do we have any understanding what level leaks exist within this span of work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6696.454s">What</a> level gas leaks, I believe there's level one, two, and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6701.997s">What</a> level leaks are within this span of construction?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6758.86s">I</a> don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6760.121s">My</a> question wasn't how many leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6762.402s">What</a> level leak is in that particular area? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6766.144s">Are</a> they grade one, two, or three?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6776.21s">Two</a> or three. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6776.711s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6780.033s">Right,</a> which is very common in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6782.654s">We</a> have hundreds of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6783.895s">around</a> the community, hundreds and hundreds of grade level two and grade level three leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6790.258s">And</a> I realize this wasn't a planned project, but by no stretch of the imagination, we're replacing these because they're leaks that are emergency in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6800.483s">So</a> I would differ with my colleague a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6802.585s">I</a> appreciate the fact that he may see this a little different, but these aren't leaks of emergency nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6812.175s">This</a> is work being done on behalf of the MWRA, which has nothing to do with gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6819.525s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6819.785s">They</a> have nothing to do with gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6821.207s">They're</a> looking at their own piping underneath the gas lines and naturally have to move gas lines in order to get to their piping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6828.153s">So</a> I think that's why I believe strongly the MWRA should be ponying up some money into this project, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6836.962s">Like</a> we do with all other projects, like the Eversource and so forth, that we look for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6842.827s">And</a> I don't see that other than just resurfacing and restriping an area that we're getting any mitigation on this project, we're getting disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6854.217s">And</a> a lot of it, Mr. President, in a highly traveled street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6858.381s">So</a> again, I will not be supporting this paper on behalf of area residents, Mr. President, because I don't think we've done our due diligence as a community to negotiate <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6869.11s">with</a> these two particular utility companies in order to get the utmost benefit on behalf of our residents and our city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6876.413s">So</a> I will not be supporting this paper tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7096.793s">So,</a> Mr. President, while we have the city engineer on, has he had a discussion with the head of WIAS, Mr. Randazzo, about the OptiComm system at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street, which is used to allow ambulances and emergency vehicles to pass through quickly at major intersections?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7229.166s">So</a> Mr. President, I believe I offered the language last week, but I'll do it again, that item 12 be amended to read the engineering division requests that National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to Riverside Ave curbing project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7246.77s">So</a> I'll add that, however, Mr. President, knowing what we heard tonight from the representative from National Grid, that they are not going to fund such a project or even partially fund a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7261.796s">Mr.</a> President, I will not be supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7264.877s">And</a> I would ask my fellow colleagues, in order to send a message to National Grid and the MWRA, let them go back and work this out, that we do not support this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7276.542s">even</a> with this language, because this language is, as Councilor Scarpelli stated, a false sense of security. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7282.967s">Because</a> ideally, I believe we've all, not ideally, I believe we've all heard that it's not going to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7292.775s">So</a> that's why I will not be supporting it, even with that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7296.217s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7297.778s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7347.71s">Point</a> of information, councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7349.711s">Mr.</a> President, no one's looking for a blank check.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7355.713s">I</a> know, and we can word it, as you see, we're the legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7359.235s">We</a> can word it any way we can strike an agreement tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7362.196s">So</a> if you're willing to strike an agreement, we're willing to word it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7365.938s">But</a> by no means are we looking for a blank check or an open-ended proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7371.183s">We're</a> asking that you contribute towards a project that the city will implement and work on, having nothing to do with your scope of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7379.952s">And</a> if we can get that commitment tonight, you'll have my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7382.975s">And</a> I don't know where other people stand, but if not, you may have to go back to the drawing board.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7473.857s">But</a> I can look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7475.519s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7476.279s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7477.48s">Mr.</a> President, I think what Councilor Knight just brought up a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7482.324s">Maybe</a> if we lay this on the table for one week, asking the representative, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7486.928s">Cuddy,</a> to go back and ask whether or not they'd be willing to give the amount of the resurface and the striping towards the curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7500.083s">if</a> they would be willing to make that type of commitment to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7505.88s">Or</a> any commitment to the city, I don't know the cost.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7512.841s">So</a> $400,000, so if we can get some type of- We'll take half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7515.662s">You</a> got a deal? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7516.962s">If</a> we can get some type of commitment, Mr. President, between now and next week, I'd be willing to support this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7524.904s">And</a> like I said, it doesn't have to be done under their scope of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7528.684s">This</a> will be something that the city will embark upon at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7533.338s">But</a> I would ask if the representative is amendable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7539.184s">If</a> she doesn't think that will happen, then I'm prepared to vote no tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7543.529s">Connie,</a> would you be able to comment on that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7552.801s">I'm</a> not looking for a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7553.922s">That</a> was Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7554.863s">I'm</a> looking for you just to make a commitment, a mitigation commitment to this city to put funding within, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7566.139s">the</a> curbing for Riverside F. And if you can't, I can appreciate you can't make that commitment, but if we give you a week, are you willing to come back or?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7605.806s">I</a> think that would go a long way to doing sidewalks and some curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7609.148s">It's</a> not the entire lane, if you look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7610.849s">There's</a> some sections that don't need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7613.431s">So</a> I think that would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7615.632s">So</a> if you're willing to do that, I'd be willing to lay it on the table for one week, if my council colleagues see fit.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7646.221s">Motion</a> to lay on the table for one week, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7649.082s">Pending</a> response from National Grid on the mitigation response for the curbing on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7659.246s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Markswell.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9100.743s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I know some of my colleagues that live in the area are very familiar with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9106.905s">We</a> all recall when we had the meetings at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9110.245s">Francis</a> back a couple years ago, and there were a number of area residents that came down regarding speeding, cut through traffic, lack of signage in the Heights area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9124.809s">And</a> I thought really, Mr. President, at the time we had <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9129.951s">all</a> the players at the table, and I really, really thought some movement was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9136.951s">And</a> now it's been two years, Mr. President, and other than some signs that are restricted use only during rush hour and resident only signs, there's been very little done, to be quite honest with you, in regards to trying to alleviate some of the concerns of area residents in that neighborhood regarding cut through, regarding speeding, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9162.548s">We</a> did request, Mr. President, that a complete comprehensive traffic study be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9169.997s">Does</a> anyone behind this reel know of or read or aware of this comprehensive traffic study?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9187.954s">That</a> may have been part of the study, and Officer Brooks does a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9192.197s">But</a> Mr. President, I'm not aware of any comprehensive traffic study that resulted from this council's request over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9202.442s">residents</a> request over and over again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9206.043s">And</a> it's quite troubling when you have area residents that call you up and say, whatever resulted with the meetings that we had at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9213.984s">Francis?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9215.285s">Whatever</a> resulted with the traffic commission that was going to look into speeding cars and cut through traffic? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9221.186s">Whatever</a> resulted from the additional signage that we spoke about on Fulton Spring Road, Fels Ave, Murray Hill Road, Fels Ave Terrace, that particular corridor, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9232.448s">which</a> is still a bone of contention for many, many area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9236.812s">I</a> don't have to tell you that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9238.674s">You're</a> well aware of the concerns and have fought just as hard to get something done in that particular area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9246.441s">I</a> had a resident call me the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9248.664s">It</a> said, we as residents were concerned about a four-way stop at Rockland Road, Fels Ave, and Fels Ave Terrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9258.35s">And</a> they asked for a four-way stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9260.851s">They</a> were told by someone within the police department or the traffic division, well, what you need to do first is get together a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9271.694s">Then</a> you're going to get more than 50% of the area residents to sign the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9277.635s">And</a> we'll entertain it with the traffic commission to put up a four-way stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9283.863s">And</a> I'm thinking to myself, Mr-.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9291.965s">That's</a> an excellent point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9293.546s">I'm</a> not sure what that process was, but I can tell you, Mr. President, it's one thing to say that you're looking to get resident permit parking on a street and to see if there's a buy-in from the area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9306.45s">I</a> can see that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9308.27s">I</a> may not agree with having someone go out and do the legwork, but I can see why that's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9313.552s">But</a> to get basic signage regarding four-way stops, Mr. President, there should not be a need of area residents to get together, sign petitions, do the legwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9325.145s">It</a> makes absolutely no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9327.968s">That</a> should be an issue that's presented before the Traffic Commission and let them do their homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9333.727s">No</a> reflection on the traffic commission, but I've stated this for years as a member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9338.35s">We</a> used to have a traffic commission and then an off-street parking commission in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9342.513s">And</a> people would say, how do I get this done? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9344.494s">Well,</a> I'm not sure, you may have to go to the off-street parking commission or the traffic commission, maybe they don't handle that particular item. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9350.278s">We</a> finally merged both back some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9352.379s">We</a> finally merged them together, so it's one stop shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9355.521s">However,</a> Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9358.203s">I</a> hate to say it, but the chief of police in his capacity with a department of over 100 people in a major city is also the chair of the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9368.671s">And</a> in my opinion, no reflection, I know many of the members and they do great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9373.655s">It's</a> a reactionary body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9376.408s">They</a> don't go out looking to make improvements, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9380.19s">They</a> just wait for stuff to come to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9382.771s">And</a> I think it's long overdue that we look how we operate the rules and regulations and how our traffic commission operates, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9392.396s">Because</a> it's too much of a process to get quick turnaround and things to happen quick in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9400.6s">Because</a> you may get something through the traffic commission, but it may take you eight months to get the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9405.965s">Erect</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9408.126s">It's</a> just an issue, Mr. President, that needs to be attended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9412.509s">And</a> like I said, I hope I don't offend anyone, but when you see something that needs to be attended to, after so many years, the traffic commission's created by, I believe, the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9423.837s">It</a> was a home rule petition that creates the traffic commission and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9427.76s">It</a> needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9429.582s">It</a> possibly needs to be revisited. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9433.845s">A</a> couple of the concerns I had with area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9437.047s">that</a> I tried to bring to the chief's attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9440.911s">I'm</a> still waiting for phone calls back from the chief from weeks and months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9446.998s">Multiple</a> phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9449.101s">I</a> realize he's a busy man, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9452.885s">In</a> that capacity, you have to delegate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9456.115s">If</a> you're that busy that you can't return a call to a resident or an elected official or whoever it might be, then maybe you should practice the art of delegating and having someone follow up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9470.616s">I</a> went to him because he was the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9474.908s">And</a> I have to say, I am very disappointed in not getting a return phone call, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9480.591s">Common</a> courtesy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9481.812s">It</a> wasn't on my behalf, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9484.493s">It</a> was on behalf of the residents that are so angry, Mr. President, that they see no results on meetings, city meetings, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9494.559s">But</a> yet again, I'm going to call for another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9497.112s">And</a> that's what this resident said, and we're going to have more of the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9500.574s">And</a> it's hard for me as an elected official to say, you know what, the other meetings we had at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9504.297s">Francis,</a> we tried to do something but nothing resulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9507.539s">This</a> onsite meeting, hopefully we'll get the chief, hopefully he'll participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9512.421s">I</a> know he's busy, hopefully we can get him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9514.462s">Hopefully</a> we'll get the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9516.183s">The</a> mayor has stated when she ran for public office, she stated unequivocally, I'm gonna be before that Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9523.929s">I</a> believe even one time she said, they'll see me so many times, they'll get sick of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9529.192s">I</a> know it's COVID, Mr. President, but the line of communication is not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9534.047s">It's</a> not there, it's lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9535.608s">That's</a> why I'm asking for an on-site visit, Mr. President, with the traffic engineer, with the head of DPW, with the mayor, and our office, and the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9548.399s">And</a> I would hope, Mr. President, as I put two Saturdays down, the weather's still fine, COVID's out there, but we can meet outdoors in a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9560.16s">and</a> inviting area residents to let us know what they go through on a daily basis, dealing with the traffic and the cut through. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9567.682s">And</a> this is during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9569.683s">You</a> guys see it, it's starting to pick up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9574.284s">It</a> had a lull for a little while and it's starting to pick up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9580.447s">And</a> residents are very concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9583.13s">So</a> I would ask with all due deference that you set up those meetings, Mr. President, on one of the other dates.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9593.984s">This</a> is an extremely important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9597.248s">This</a> is happening throughout the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9600.458s">We</a> have to get a handle on what's happening on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9603.419s">We've</a> got to take back our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9605.26s">We</a> have to make it safe for pedestrians, bicyclists, cars, anyone that wants to traverse, Mr. President, our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9613.042s">We</a> have to make it safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9614.603s">And</a> clearly, what's happening up the heights right now is not safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9618.384s">And</a> a few signs that are put saying area residents only or restrictive use doesn't take the place of enforcement, doesn't take the place of additional signage, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9630.971s">And</a> my second point, the Connor of Doonan and, Doonan and, that's the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9642.454s">I'll</a> leave that for the next one, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9648.115s">But</a> it's the same issue, Mr. President, and that I'll leave for the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9652.376s">But</a> I would hope my fellow colleagues, Mr. President, I know they all support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9657.359s">And</a> I'm sure many of them are tired of hearing of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9659.981s">But</a> guess what, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9661.501s">It</a> still remains a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9664.143s">And</a> maybe our public safety, I think Councilor Bears, are you the chairman of public safety subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9669.766s">The</a> public safety sub, it may not be you, but we really need to have a public safety summit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9675.81s">I've</a> been calling for it for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9677.951s">And</a> I've still yet to get a buy-in from the city administration or the chief of police to call for a public safety summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9686.835s">And</a> it's long overdue in this community, and maybe we as a council have to call for the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9692.883s">Because</a> clearly this administration and the chief of police have other things that they're embroiled in right now, and it's clearly not safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9702.535s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9706.336s">Anybody</a> else like to speak?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9841.952s">Why</a> don't we set it for the 21st and what time works? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9844.874s">Is</a> a better time?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9848.237s">Why</a> don't we set it for the 21st at 11 o'clock? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9850.118s">Carr</a> Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9851.219s">And</a> say Carr Park.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9861.546s">I</a> second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9862.347s">Let's</a> meet right in that stretch, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9864.068s">You</a> pick an area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9865.069s">Fulton</a> Street and Fern Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9866.23s">Yep,</a> a corner and we'll meet right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9870.573s">If</a> you want to do Fulton Spring and Fern.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9887.409s">And</a> I second Councilor Knight's robo-call.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9914.421s">Mr.</a> President, just so we are all under the same impression, that the roll call go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9919.725s">First</a> we invite all the department heads and so forth, and the roll call go out requesting that the Method City Council is requesting this meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9934.116s">Chief</a> of Police, City Engineer, Traffic Engineer, DPW Commissioner, Mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9942.83s">And</a> mayor's office, anyone else? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9944.791s">I</a> mean, I think that covers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9955.898s">Just</a> tell the chief, the chief, you know, it's fine.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9968.046s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9968.587s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9970.341s">Right,</a> that cover, I may have missed the street or two, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9973.304s">I</a> mean, does that cover Fulton Spring Road, Fell's Ave?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9978.208s">Murray</a> Hill Road.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9982.892s">You</a> want to add Rockland Road? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9984.674s">You</a> want to add Fern?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9988.677s">Let's</a> hit that chunk of area.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9998.228s">How</a> are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9998.549s">Westfield</a> and some of the- West. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10000.21s">Rova.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10010.036s">I'll</a> go whatever you want to send it out to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10011.797s">We'll</a> figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10012.458s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10012.578s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10012.678s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10013.478s">It'll</a> be sent to the whole ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10017.641s">It's</a> not a bad idea.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10058.36s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10059.601s">And</a> actually, this was an intersection that we ended up getting after many years of four-way stop at the corner of Doonan and Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10068.685s">Some</a> of the signs that were erected were put back in an angle that makes it very difficult for people coming into the intersection of Park and Doonan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10079.872s">And</a> from what I'm being told by area residents, that people are blowing right through the four-way stop, not stopping at all, just going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10089.578s">They</a> believe partially it's the inability of people to see the signs when they're approaching because of the angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10097.243s">Now,</a> I had a discussion with Chief Buckley. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10100.967s">We</a> were going back and forth with a couple of the residents and the chief, and the follow-up wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10108.536s">I</a> reached back out to Chief Buckley, and the follow-up still wasn't there, and the calls weren't returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10115.924s">And</a> that's why it's on the agenda, Mr. President, which is unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10120.506s">But</a> I'm asking, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety, that the chief of police, along with his traffic division, go out and take a cursory look <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10136.234s">at</a> this particular intersection and see what may be the underlining problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10141.236s">Why</a> cars are blowing through this intersection, if it's how the signs are faced, the stop signs are faced or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10149.318s">And</a> also, Mr. President, the residents asked for, no one wants to get ticketed, but they asked for increased enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10156.322s">And</a> it happened for a short period of time, and then it got brushed aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10160.727s">And</a> people are real concerned about safety and concern of area residents in that area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10167.815s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10853.359s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10854.219s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10855.785s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10856.625s">I</a> thank Councilor Bierce for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10859.566s">You</a> know, it's no secret the MBTA, even before COVID, has been trying to cut service for years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10866.768s">You</a> know, for an agency that's responsible for public transportation, I've never met a group of people that are looking to cut services constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10877.03s">And</a> I can appreciate they're dealing with the budget and so forth, never ending. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10882.191s">You</a> know, I just read an article that <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10884.952s">We're</a> creating dedicated bus lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10887.894s">We're</a> creating rapid busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10891.517s">And</a> then in the same breath, we're cutting bus service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10895.96s">Does</a> it make any sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10897.841s">It</a> makes zero sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10900.623s">And</a> COVID, we've been dealing with COVID since March. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10905.206s">It's</a> now November. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10907.487s">So</a> they wait, what, seven months to figure out that bus service ridership is down? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10915.125s">It</a> took them seven months to figure that out, and now they want to make these draconian cuts across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10922.213s">I</a> was watching the news tonight, they're cutting ferry service for the salt shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10926.277s">They're</a> cutting across the board some deep, impacting cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10930.601s">And</a> as Councilor Beals mentioned, once it's gone, it's going to be very hard to get it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10936.885s">The</a> 326 and the 325, as you know, Mr. President, those are vital lines that take residents into town, vital to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10948.613s">And</a> always constantly on the chopping block. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10951.114s">I</a> know a lot of the other routes have been subject to cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10956.378s">But</a> those particular lines, for some reason, and you pay through the nose to get on them, those are always the first they want to chop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10965.625s">We</a> had a problem with overabundance of people on those routes, because they were cutting the routes and the limit of the capacity on the bus would be 50 or 60 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10977.037s">There</a> were 80 or 90 people on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10979.92s">It</a> was like a cartoon you were hanging out the window to take a bus ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10985.74s">And</a> then we finally figured it out that they had to add some more roots on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10991.987s">And</a> they did, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10993.849s">But</a> the ridership was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10995.37s">Then</a> COVID kicked in, the ridership's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10997.993s">But</a> it's gonna come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10998.914s">I</a> hope this is temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11000.436s">And</a> that's what, everything I've read they're saying, I don't know if it's just PR, that this is gonna be temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11007.037s">But</a> I have a tough time believing that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11009.439s">And</a> I hope a lot of residents get on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11011.18s">But</a> I don't get a warm, fuzzy feeling when I deal with the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11015.503s">I</a> really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11017.104s">It's</a> their way or the highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11018.845s">No</a> pun intended. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11020.126s">It's</a> pretty funny, though.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11026.429s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11538.337s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11539.198s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for co-sponsoring this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11546.482s">If</a> you know the Crotties, you know what type of people they are, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11551.625s">They're</a> true family people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11553.746s">They</a> are people that love their city, love their neighborhood, are always willing to step up and be the first to commit themselves to whatever they do in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11566.914s">50</a> years of wedding bliss, Mr. President, goes without saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11571.499s">When</a> you see Joanne, you see Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11574.383s">When</a> you see Ron, you see Joanne. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11576.306s">They're</a> like frickin' frack. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11579.109s">They</a> go together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11580.911s">They're</a> a perfect match. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11582.673s">And</a> I wish them well on 50 years of wedding bliss. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11587.958s">And</a> I just want to also say hi to Mary Ann, who is another integral part of Ron and Joanne. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11597.466s">And</a> I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Knight, for putting this on.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11862.288s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11862.968s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11866.57s">The</a> issue on Commercial Street has been brought up for the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11871.693s">And</a> I believe there was a sign put up back about two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11876.816s">It</a> says no idling. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11878.477s">So</a> the trucks used to park there and idle for hours and hours and hours, so they stopped the idling. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11882.92s">But</a> if you're going to stop and shop and come out the commercial street entrance, it is such a dangerous area now because they park the 18 wheelers and you have to literally inch, inch, inch, otherwise you're going to get in a horrific accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11897.049s">It's</a> really bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11899.851s">And</a> I think at the very least that this should be sent to our traffic division to have them take a look, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11908.017s">I</a> don't know how other communities do it, but maybe we can get creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11912.14s">And</a> if these truckers want to park for hours in a particular area and take up spots that are not one car spot, two cars, but ten car spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11922.987s">in</a> a particular area, maybe we should charge them so and maybe have areas on these streets that offer trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11931.35s">because</a> as Councilor Knight mentioned, these truckers keep logs and they have to be off the road a certain amount of hours and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11939.533s">So</a> we don't want to encourage truckers to not get their rest, they need their rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11944.955s">But</a> maybe we should come up with creative ways that we allow a certain number of them in areas that are conducive to this and charge them at the same time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11954.2s">If</a> I have to go put meters in the kiosk when I'm in the square, why can a trucker stay there for 12 hours on Commercial Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11962.265s">because</a> they're delivering something? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11963.725s">Who</a> cares? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11965.746s">Charge</a> them.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=388.885s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=389.605s">I</a> wish you good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=390.405s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=733.022s">And</a> I think, I don't know if Councilor Bears had one also.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=756.078s">So</a> what do we ask to vote on tonight?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=776.464s">I</a> second the motion to table by Councilor Knight.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1071.783s">No</a> painting?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1727.199s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1728.86s">I</a> was wondering if the petitioner can answer several questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1733.224s">Does</a> this run the entire length of Riverside Ave?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1783.116s">Does</a> it not go up to Locust Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1786.718s">Let</a> me see, Locust Street.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1834.225s">Right,</a> so I'm just trying to figure out, so does this construction start after 93 on Riverside Ave and go all the way up to Locust Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1843.29s">Is</a> that roughly the area? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1844.35s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1891.787s">So</a> the number of feet that's being installed of eight-inch plastic gas main and six-inch plastic gas main is about 1,700 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1901.929s">So</a> I'm just trying to figure out how much of Riverside Ave that would cover.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1923.222s">Lake</a> Drive starts right across from Spring, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1926.763s">Hall</a> Street is from Spring to Hall.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1933.124s">That's</a> not that big of an area.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1935.705s">You</a> think that's 500 yards?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1963.98s">When</a> is the anticipated start date and what's the duration?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1999.539s">So</a> what are we looking at, the middle of November?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2005.103s">And</a> what's the project duration?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2014.35s">Do</a> you work for National Grid?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2019.133s">This</a> is not a Zoom bomb, is it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2024.917s">Oh,</a> we have Zoom bombs all the time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2037.316s">The</a> reason why I ask is I've had calls from concerned neighbors because if they're going to do any type of shut off of gas, especially over the winter months, they're concerned about heating in their homes and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2048.38s">So</a> there's a lot of associated questions on when this work will take place and how long will it last for.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2081.724s">So</a> when you say slight interruption, roughly how long does that changeover take?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2096.27s">So</a> that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2098.111s">If</a> this work is going on, just say, in December and January, and when it's 10 below, to have your heat off for five, six hours could be a problem.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2120.231s">So</a> that brings us into probably January. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2123.589s">November</a> 15 is towards the end of December, beginning of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2129.353s">So</a> I'd be real curious to know how long these changeovers take, and if there's anything we can do to get a quicker changeover on behalf of the residents that are going to be impacted.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2197.106s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2198.127s">So</a> why was this project held off until the winter months?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2212.396s">Right,</a> because to me, this would seem like the most inconvenient time to do a gas changeover in the winter months. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2220.995s">And</a> I realize the MWRE is requesting it, but that seems like a real selfish request to do it in the cold winter months of New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2231.504s">It</a> doesn't make any sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2234.947s">Okay,</a> so my next point is, and this may be a question for, is our city engineer on the call, Mr. President, do you know?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2259.569s">Projects</a> of this nature, I would just request in the future that the city engineer be part of the call as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2266.382s">especially</a> with these conditions, there's 14 conditions that were put on by our engineering division. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2272.145s">And</a> I would ask that someone, a representative from the city, be present on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2279.269s">The</a> question I had, Mr. President, and this has been an issue that's been near and dear to me for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2285.592s">Many</a> of us travel down Riverside Ave constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2289.354s">I</a> happen to live right off of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2292.196s">And</a> many of the curbs <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2296.478s">a</a> level with the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2299.559s">So</a> there's no distinction between a sidewalk and the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2303.761s">They've</a> become level. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2305.401s">And</a> that's a very dangerous proposition for area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2309.743s">We</a> just had a house struck at the corner of Locust and Riverside, where a car plowed in to his walkway and his stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2318.026s">Thank</a> God no one was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2319.406s">And</a> it demolished brick and cement stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2322.945s">And</a> that was largely in part, Mr. President, bad driving, one thing, but the fact that there's no distinction between a sidewalk, there's no curbing, and it's a very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2334.903s">Under</a> number 12, under the conditions, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2338.087s">It</a> says the scope of the MWRA section 57 project includes resurfacing and striping this portion of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2346.332s">So</a> they're saying the MWRA is responsible for the resurfacing and restriping. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2352.575s">That's</a> great, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2354.356s">But</a> what about the curbs that are level with the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2359.879s">In</a> my opinion, if we're going to look at resurfacing this road, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2364.913s">We</a> have to do it correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2366.254s">If</a> they're going to grind it up or whatever they're going to do, we have to make these curbs full curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2373.616s">And</a> now's the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2374.817s">And</a> it would cover a large stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2377.238s">This</a> particular recommendation says the engineering division requests that National Grid contribute the cost of the final restoration to other paving in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2387.361s">So</a> they're saying, we realize MWRE is going to do the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2391.303s">We're</a> doing the job, but they're going to pay for the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2394.41s">And</a> instead of us being responsible for something, we'll do some work somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2400.452s">I</a> would submit to you, Mr. President, the work should be on Riverside Ave, and it should be leveling off the curbs on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2407.995s">So</a> I don't agree with this condition 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2410.796s">This</a> money should be spent on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2413.257s">It</a> should bring those curbs up to the current standards, the safety guidelines and highway standards of DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2420.787s">which</a> I can guarantee you level curbs with streets are not the safety standard of DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2427.788s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, I'm going to ask that we don't approve this tonight, even though this is going to prolong this a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2434.81s">And</a> that's why I was hoping our city engineer would be on until we can get a commitment that the curbing on Riverside Ave will be part of the condition from National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2447.081s">to</a> recreate the elevation on the curbing when they do the street resurfacing over for that particular stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2454.764s">So</a> that would be my first recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2458.946s">My</a> second recommendation is that at the corner, and I'm not sure this would be a question for National Grid, it would be a question for our engineer, but at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street, as we know, there was a fire many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2474.485s">in</a> the DPW public works building that held most of the plans of our engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2481.908s">And</a> many of the plans were lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2483.769s">And</a> from what I'm being told, the plans and the drawings for the underground utilities at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street are no longer around. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2496.534s">So</a> you can't find these plans because they were burnt in the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2500.878s">And</a> now would be a perfect time if they're going to be digging up that area, which they are, would be a perfect time to recreate these drawings and digitize the underground utilities in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2512.823s">That</a> would save us a heartache, Mr. President, and also get the work done on behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2518.228s">And</a> I raise this question because when they were working on Wegmans and the project on Locust Street, there were many questions raised about underground utilities, and the city of Medford could not produce these plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2530.621s">So</a> I would ask that as a second recommendation, that at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2536.767s">that</a> during this project that the city recreate the drawings and digitize underground utilities at that particular location in the interest of our public safety and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2552.757s">So</a> I would ask that that be part of a condition on this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2556.54s">My</a> third and final condition, Mr. President, is that that particular set of lights, as we all know, that's a busy, busy intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2564.905s">Especially</a> now we're adding 400 and I believe it's 50 units in that area of new housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2573.367s">And</a> we have the Wegmans, which is very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2576.528s">And</a> the Opticom system, which you know is the little gadget that they put on the lights when ambulances and fire trucks go through intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2587.09s">It</a> has a connection to our public safety vehicles and it allows these vehicles to go through in a quick manner and in a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2595.372s">And</a> that particular intersection, we can ask head of Y's, I don't believe has the OptiComm system in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2603.316s">And</a> I would ask that it be installed as a recommendation or a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2610.16s">under</a> this particular digging, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2612.381s">If</a> we're going to dig the street, that requires wiring under the roads and so forth, and that be done during this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2620.025s">So</a> I would ask that that be outlined as a condition also that the Opticomp system at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street be done during this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2634.147s">So</a> those are my three conditions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2636.909s">I</a> would respectfully ask that we lay this on the table for one week, Mr. President, to get answers back from our engineering department, our head of wires, and also a national grid on the curbs and other two conditions that I put on this, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2705.451s">Very</a> accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2706.092s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2716.154s">Oh,</a> I don't want to table right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2717.355s">I</a> want to hear from my colleagues, but I am going to ultimately ask that this be tabled if we can't get answers tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=2724.096s">This</a> is a very important road, length of road in our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3579.969s">Mr.</a> Engineer, my question is, I actually had three questions, but as you know, the curbing on Riverside Ave for the most part is level with the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3593.914s">And</a> I was wondering what your thoughts are if we are going to do a paving and a re-striping and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3601.776s">why</a> we wouldn't be addressing, at least within this stretch, the restoration of the curbing and reestablish it as a true curb and not something that's level with the street.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3673.761s">Right,</a> so as part of <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3676.637s">Number</a> 12, Tim, it says that the MWRA section 57 project includes resurfacing and striping of this portion of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3687.382s">And</a> then it goes on to say the engineering division requests that National Grid contribute to the cost of a final restoration to other paving in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3696.728s">So</a> it seems to me that we could ask of National Grid to step up and look at some of our curbing conditions, but rather the condition in here states we'll look at them to do other projects in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3711.397s">And</a> what I'm saying is right now, I don't believe that the current condition of that curbing on most of Riverside Ave meets any safety standard of DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3722.723s">I</a> can't see how a level curb that meets the street meets any requirement of safety standard.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3746.122s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3746.583s">So</a> what I'll do different, and this is no reflection on you, because you're relatively new in terms of this city, is that I've been hearing about Riverside Avenue curbing for a number of years, a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3764.142s">And</a> now we have an opportunity where we have the MWRA and we have National Grid doing a fairly major project. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3773.166s">And</a> we're asking to resurface a street that we already know has some potential safety issues, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3781.149s">the</a> curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3782.43s">And</a> we're not going to address it at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3784.251s">We're</a> going to kind of kick the can down the street again. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3787.552s">And</a> I appreciate the fact that this may be much larger than the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3791.954s">But</a> I think at this point, I assume they're going to be grinding the entire street down?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3807.278s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3808.378s">So</a> why not take this opportunity to call upon National Grid and the MWRA to step up <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3821.321s">and</a> do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3824.147s">I</a> just don't understand it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3879.994s">Okay,</a> so would you be amendable then to updating your conditions to include in the language rather than say that final restoration to other paving in the city, which is the responsibility of National Grid, that the engineering division requested National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to curbing on Riverside Ave?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3919.26s">OK,</a> so I would ask, Mr. President, that that language be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3924.643s">So</a> we'd read, the engineering division, this is bullet point 12, requests that National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3934.542s">to</a> curbing on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3940.046s">And</a> then it goes on to say, this can be coordinated with the engineering division, which is perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3944.851s">We</a> have our city engineer that can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3947.433s">So</a> that sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3950.216s">The</a> second thing, Tim, and you may be able to clarify this, is I'm under the impression that many of our drawings that were lost in the fire down at the old DPW public works building <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3965.988s">The</a> drawings were lost that show the corner of Locust Street and Riverside Ave regarding underground utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3974.693s">Is</a> that accurate assessment?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3991.087s">Okay,</a> so at this point, would it make sense to put a condition in there where the road's gonna be ripped up that we look at recreating drawings and digitize our underground utilities at the corner of Locust and Riverside during this construction?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4027.205s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4028.145s">As</a> you said, their pipe is well below yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4031.787s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4033.088s">So</a> it would seem to me that this would be a perfect time, and I defer to the city engineer, that if indeed we don't have these drawings on file, this would be the perfect time to digitize the underground utilities in that area.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4065.171s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4066.011s">But</a> you're doing this job on their behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4068.932s">So</a> now we have leverage through you to the MWRA, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4073.673s">So</a> now we're requesting that this take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4075.754s">So</a> I could appreciate the fact that you don't have, National Grid doesn't really have any responsibility in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4081.476s">But</a> now's the time that we as a community have leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4084.617s">So</a> I would ask the city engineer, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4088.217s">if</a> that would make sense at this point.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4174.446s">OK,</a> so I will leave that up to your expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4180.071s">My</a> last question, and this may be not a question to you, but the Opticom system, I know we have one further down, I believe on Riverside Ave, for fire trucks and ambulances. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4192.902s">Does</a> that wiring happen underground, do you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4198.727s">When</a> they wire the intersections? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4201.47s">What's</a> that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4208.451s">Okay,</a> so maybe Mr. President, if we can ask that question of Head of WIAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4217.592s">to</a> ask them, and if the case is that the wiring is underground, this would be an ideal time for the city, rather than dig it up again, because that's a very busy intersection, to run the proper wiring underground while this area is going to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4233.207s">So</a> I would ask that maybe if the city engineer can work in conjunction with <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4238.453s">Mr.</a> Randazzo, the head of wires, so we can check to see if the Opti-Com system and the running of wires during this particular project would be worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4249.483s">And</a> I appreciate your time, Mr. Engineer.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4277.376s">I</a> think that was it, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4279.598s">That's</a> perfect, that the city engineer and the head of wires get together and see if this would be an ideal time to run piping.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4448.339s">Well,</a> if my colleagues feel comfortable, I'm not comfortable with when this project has taken place, but I'm not sure at this point.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4526.095s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4526.735s">So,</a> Mr. President, just, uh, Councilor Knight mentioned that, I didn't see it in here, but, um, you mentioned that this was submitted to the city back in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4535.936s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4537.797s">And</a> why, why are we seeing it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4541.285s">Tim?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4543.106s">The</a> question was- I'm not sure.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4551.831s">And</a> how long would that be, Tim? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4553.352s">A</a> typical grant- I don't have that in front of me.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4558.455s">So</a> what's a typical grant allocation once you get it from your desk to when it comes before the council?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4617.312s">So</a> Mr. President, I'm curious about the urgency of this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4621.975s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4622.755s">And</a> ask that we lay this on the table for one week and get a response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4626.337s">Two</a> weeks, because you're right, we won't be meeting next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4630.28s">And</a> get a response back from the MWA on the urgency of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4634.442s">And</a> to Councilor Abeas, what exactly is the project they're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4639.666s">Mr.</a> President, and then we can make an informed decision based on our residents and based on the fact that this will be during winter time and a huge inconvenience.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8837.112s">Councilor</a> Locks. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8838.769s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8839.81s">I</a> want to thank Council President Falco for bringing this very important issue forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8846.894s">I</a> know my council colleagues asked a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8850.476s">I</a> do want to say on the lines of Councilor Bears that if we do indeed leave money on the table, that would be a complete disgrace to leave any money on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8868.026s">Knowing</a> what we know now, Dave, I know you've just been around for a little period of time, but I have a tough time believing over the years that we have not identified through our building grounds and maintenance the need to make updates to exhaust fans, ventilation, HVAC, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8890.205s">These</a> issues, issues that have been recognized over the previous years,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8953.966s">Right,</a> so what I'm hearing tonight is that the school district has been aware for many years that they've had some non-instructional reasons that there may be concerns with portions of our buildings, but those particular items have been <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8973.544s">kick</a> down, push down the list of priorities for other priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8979.467s">And</a> I think what we're seeing right now and part of the frustration is, and this is no reflection on you in particular, Dave, or the superintendent, or the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8989.852s">But</a> I think when we look at lack of maintenance within our buildings, and this is not exclusive to the school department because the city side is at fault as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9001.577s">We've</a> always kicked the can down the street when it comes to building maintenance and upkeep. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9007.959s">And</a> I think what we're seeing right now is a system that is plagued with a lot of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9018.783s">And</a> concerns that should have been addressed over the years, now are being addressed because of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9024.425s">So</a> the one thing that we did get out of COVID was the fact that, in my opinion, these building maintenance concerns, which get brought up every year, and why we don't allocate a certain amount of money to address these needs, because it gets pushed off. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9042.839s">I</a> think this was, if anything, a great learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9047.543s">And</a> I hope it doesn't become any other experience other than a learning experience at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9053.327s">But</a> the question I have, Dave, is do we anticipate, and this may be a question for Alicia, and I know it's tough to tell, do we anticipate any additional funding, knowing that some of the money's going to dry up at the end of this month, and then we heard at the end of December, do we anticipate any additional funding to address the air quality concerns that are being addressed now?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9092.497s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9093.118s">And</a> are we able to tap into any of this particular CARES Act money or stimulus money that may be available to address this capital plan that the school committee and the administration is looking at?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9139.778s">Right,</a> no, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9141.18s">And</a> I understand this is new to everyone, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9144.805s">This</a> is an emergency that we've never seen the likes of before, so I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9152.496s">Relating</a> to Council President Falco's question regarding that we knew that COVID-19 was airborne and we knew about this in early March, April. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9165.339s">And</a> I am very concerned why it took so long for the school administration and the school committee to act on moving forward on some of these needs that we have regarding air quality, exhaust fans, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9180.262s">And</a> it's pretty troubling to me that we let a fair amount of time go by, and in doing so, potentially a fair amount of money be left on the table, which is very concerning in these troubling times to leave any type of money on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9197.527s">And</a> that really bothers me that there wasn't more of an emphasis on finding out air quality, which is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9208.551s">Now</a> to that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9210.412s">Have</a> we reached out to the EPA? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9213.274s">Have</a> we exhausted all the rules and regulations and standards from Mass DEP or the Clean Air, Mass Clean Air Act? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9223.643s">And</a> are we required as a school system to look at air quality? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9228.607s">And</a> if so, what, how often are we required to do so?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9514.476s">Yeah,</a> Mr. President, if I could, I asked the question, maybe it's a question for Dave Murphy, but what MAS DP rules or regulations or standards or MAS Clean Air Act or the EPA are we bound by as a school system? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9529.147s">And</a> how often, if any, are we required to do air quality testing?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9601.476s">And</a> if I could, and maybe this is a question for you, Dave, would this money also be available to do improvements such as relating to air quality, such as windows and so forth?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9618.467s">The</a> CARES money in particular.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9734.634s">So</a> just moving forward, Dave, what did we learn about the lack of building maintenance? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9741.037s">Have</a> we learned anything from this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9802.13s">And</a> just my last point, and I know we talk about school buildings, a lot of people don't envision the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9814.795s">But</a> let me tell you, we do have a very well functioning vocational school that's been recognized over the years and there's been a lot of improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9825.959s">And</a> it's very troubling to me, as a former graduate of the vocational school, to hear that we have shops that have poor air quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9837.168s">And</a> knowing what takes place in a vocational shop, which is welding, which is automotive, things that emit toxic fumes, knowing that our students are being subjected in these shops to a poor air quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9855.683s">really</a> raises a red flag to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9858.345s">And</a> I've yet to hear anything really about the vocational school, but it's a major, major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9867.369s">And</a> I think it's something that needs to be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9870.751s">I</a> know Dave, you mentioned that it's an area that's being looked at, but <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9875.493s">With</a> the nature of our shops and the work that's taking place, it's unacceptable to have poor air quality in those particular shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9885.218s">And</a> I hope that that's something that's on the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9888.439s">And</a> moving forward, it's something that's reviewed not on an annual basis, but maybe a monthly basis in these shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9896.843s">We</a> probably have the same filters in some of those shops when I attended some 40 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9902.546s">And</a> that's not a joke because of the lack of maintenance and the lack of upkeep. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9907.713s">So</a> I would hope that this special attention paid to our vocational school in those particular shops.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10987.585s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10988.926s">So</a> from my understanding on Councilor Morell's question, they have spent $84,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10996.628s">Is</a> that not correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11000.13s">Not</a> $102,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11001.03s">So</a> only $84,000 has been expended.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11022.378s">Right,</a> but that's not money that's been expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11025.739s">So</a> out of the 35 method applicants, all 35 were accepted, or were there more method applicants?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11145.913s">So</a> Mr. President, just if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11148.914s">So</a> the report that we have in front of us tonight says 26 applicants, and it says 67,423. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11156.896s">And</a> then there were nine applicants that are waiting to be finalized and require additional documentation at a request of 35,881. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11170.818s">So</a> now we're being asked or stated that it's no longer 35, it's 51. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11177.824s">So</a> out of the 51, what percent or how many are applications that have already received assistance, compared to those that are currently in process?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11199.961s">And</a> I thought you said that was $84,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11201.062s">That</a> is $84,000.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11226.468s">So</a> currently we have then, not nine, we have 16 applicants that are waiting to be finalized or require additional documentation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11236.816s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11237.877s">And</a> all 51 Method residents.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11245.142s">And</a> how many total applications did we receive from Method residents?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11264.34s">Okay,</a> so I assume the 16 that didn't get anything because they didn't meet the eligibility requirements.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11283.468s">And</a> so the number I come up with is, I know Councilor Morell just gave a ballpark, but it's 103,304. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11290.351s">That</a> means we have roughly $22,000 or $21,700 left in the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11292.151s">And</a> your average is $2,000 per person, so that would lead me to believe there's about 11 or <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11312.301s">more</a> residents that we can get on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11316.262s">And</a> how many applications do we have in the bucket right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11321.703s">Not</a> including the 51.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11327.165s">You</a> have nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11328.025s">So</a> you have ample money in there right now to address the needs that you currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11333.546s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11333.686s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11337.658s">And</a> I think one of the issues that this council was concerned about, and that's why we didn't move forward, although you run a great program and I thank you for all your efforts, that we didn't want to allocate all the money because we didn't know the demand on this program and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11353.07s">And</a> I'm glad to see there is a demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11355.952s">Not</a> glad to see there's a demand, I'm glad to see we're able to meet the demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11360.555s">It's</a> unfortunate that there's a demand, but <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11365.949s">I</a> don't know if my colleagues want to appropriate the full 125,000, or should we take a portion of that knowing that we already have money in the account, $21,000 in the account, and we can accommodate everyone that's in the queue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11384.712s">Do</a> we want to give half of the 125 and then revisit it in another few months when you need it? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11389.873s">I</a> mean, that seems to be the, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11396.347s">I</a> don't know the oversight that I think we should have as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11400.308s">I'm</a> open to any of my suggestions from my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11404.468s">So</a> I would just put that out on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11406.469s">I</a> wouldn't be opposed to allocating half of the 125 at this point, knowing that we have enough for an additional 11, and there's only eight or nine in the queue, I think was just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11419.051s">So</a> I would oppose that to my colleagues.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11739.443s">Mr.</a> President, in my opinion, clearly the process that we laid out is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11744.165s">We</a> allocated $125,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11745.346s">ABCD</a> is coming back to us now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11746.266s">They</a> have a total of 21,696 that they still haven't expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11757.932s">And</a> now they're asking for more money, because the need's there, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11761.455s">But</a> we are in the process of giving them more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11766.42s">So</a> I don't see a lag here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11768.862s">I</a> don't see a reason why not for us to oversee the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11773.145s">This</a> is not money we pulled off the tree in the back of our house. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11776.208s">This</a> is taxpayers' money, and I think us as an oversight body is important, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11781.431s">And</a> it doesn't take much to present a paper to us like they are here tonight presenting a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11786.733s">So</a> I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we release $62,500 of the $125,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11794.077s">And</a> if need be, they can come back before us once that's expended and we can reallocate some more money.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11816.136s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11820.559s">What's</a> the difference?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11842.487s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11843.468s">So</a> in my opinion, and I could appreciate that, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11848.014s">I</a> as one member of the council, I'm not going to withhold one nickel from them if they're able to spend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11852.719s">And</a> I think my fellow colleagues feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11855.601s">So</a> I'm not sure why we wouldn't, I don't know why we'd want to give up our responsibility on behalf of the taxpayers to oversee this money and make sure it's judiciously spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11867.792s">And</a> I think that's a responsibility of us as the governing body.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11907.355s">Right,</a> so right now if we approve this 625, they would have 84,196 at their disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11916.203s">I</a> don't know, I think that's appropriate, Mr. President, and I do believe that we should have the oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11922.43s">And</a> I'm glad at the beginning that we, as Councilor Knight mentioned, said that this can only go to Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11928.858s">Because</a> as you can see, this money would have been spent elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11932.401s">not</a> our residents, and that we withheld half of it originally to take a look how this is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11939.545s">And</a> it's going well, and that's why we're releasing more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11942.826s">So</a> I'm comfortable with what we're doing tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11946.088s">And</a> I don't think anyone behind this reeling wants to withhold money, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12763.2s">Remember,</a> Mr. President, that this program has been in effect since June. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12768.967s">So</a> it's been almost five months, Mr. President, and they still haven't expended the original amount we gave them. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12775.515s">So</a> they haven't still gone through the original amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12778.656s">So</a> I think this is being very careful and cautious with our money, Mr. President, taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12785.077s">And</a> as everyone behind this reel has stated, no one's going to hold back one nickel, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12791.119s">So</a> I think we're doing our due diligence here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12792.939s">That's</a> all we're asking.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13034.919s">Mr.</a> President, also, if we could get a report back from the tree board. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13040.47s">regarding</a> if an inventory was done on trees within Oak Grove over the last decade.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13060.96s">Mr.</a> President, if we can get a report back from tree wanted, whether or not there's been an inventory on trees at Oak Grove Summer Park.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13092.091s">I</a> remember a study done and I thought an inventory done, I don't know if it was in the last 10 years, but maybe Aggie would know.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13112.813s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13113.493s">Do</a> you know who marked the trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13117.554s">The</a> type of tree? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13118.334s">There</a> was little markings put on each tree and the type of tree? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13123.256s">Was</a> that done by the cemetery?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13131.356s">There's</a> small metal tags on the trees telling the type of tree it is, if it's from China or, you know, the type of tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13139.16s">And</a> that was done to a number of trees in the cemetery.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13178.403s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13178.943s">Now,</a> I didn't know if that had anything to do with the previous inventory. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13182.445s">That's</a> why I was asking.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14368.295s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14369.315s">I</a> want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14372.936s">The</a> Tonello family is synonymous with community and civic duty in this community for many, many decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14381.598s">And</a> from what I hear, I didn't know Lucille, but from what I hear, she was a true family person, loved to be around family and friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14389.32s">And</a> I want to thank her for her many years of dedicated service on behalf of the children in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14396.042s">And</a> she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_ozFya1z-SYk/2024-11-19_ozFya1z-SYk.html">City Council 10-20-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=158.392s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=159.934s">I</a> put this motion on this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=163.477s">It's</a> that time of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=165.599s">We're</a> required every year to elect a president and vice president of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=171.464s">So</a> tonight I offer that we meet Tuesday, October 27th, which is next Tuesday at 6.30 for the purpose of electing a president and vice president for calendar year 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=184.116s">Second,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1176.887s">Do</a> we have the city engineer on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1346.687s">So,</a> Mr. President, if I could, just because this has been a longstanding issue with this council, it predates Todd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1358.39s">But</a> Todd, many years back, this council voted to implement a pilot program for raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1366.585s">And</a> at the time, three of them were recognized by the city under a previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1373.194s">One</a> out of the three was initiated on Winthrop Street, Central Ave, and Harvard Street have yet to get their raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1384.329s">Is</a> that something that's being looked at or can we assume now that it's been several years that that is not being reviewed and no longer is part of the commitment that was made by a previous administration?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1491.175s">Right,</a> and I realize when city administrations change, there may be a different direction in communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1498.659s">However,</a> when residents are promised certain items to happen, especially with traffic coming in their neighborhoods, they don't look at it and say, now we have a new mayor, there's a new direction, and we're not going to get the raised crosswalk we were promised under the last mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1513.946s">because</a> now there's a different direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1516.167s">I</a> don't think residents see it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1518.088s">They</a> would hope that commitments are kept from administration to administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1522.91s">And</a> when you have a pilot program, at some point, a pilot program is supposed to have an end date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1529.733s">So</a> you're supposed to review how successful the pilot was and either decide to move on with other race crosswalks or decide that they're not useful and don't provide the safety that we need in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1542.699s">But</a> either way, at some point, I think we have to put this issue to rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1547.722s">And</a> now you're the traffic engineer, and if indeed these other two areas, Central Ave, I get calls all the time about speeding cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1556.047s">I</a> think all my colleagues can attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1558.788s">This</a> was an ideal place for a raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1562.53s">I</a> can appreciate the expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1564.692s">I</a> remember on Ring Road when they put that blinking crosswalk that looked like airplane traffic lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1573.057s">on</a> ring road, that cost about $46,000 to put that on ring road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1580.902s">And</a> I would say within the first six months, it stopped working and it hasn't worked since. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1586.446s">So</a> talk about putting good money after bad money into something that is no longer even in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1592.81s">At</a> least the winter street race crosswalk is still serving a purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1597.313s">I</a> would respectfully ask as part of this paper, and I have no problem supporting this paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1602.436s">that</a> the city administration respond back, Mr. President, on where do we stand with the raised crosswalks on Central Ave and Harvard Street, the commitment that was made several years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1614.723s">And</a> if it's no longer a commitment, I'm a big boy, just let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1619.706s">And</a> I'll fight for something else, or I'll fight to see if we can get those once again to become a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1624.929s">But</a> just to leave them hanging, leave residents hanging that were promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1629.568s">These</a> were promised, these were articles in the paper, discussion among the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1633.79s">These</a> were things that were open and notorious, and then just to forget about them like nothing's going on, doesn't, in disservice to this community and the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1644.356s">And</a> that's what gives government a bad name, Mr. President, when things get forgotten about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1649.88s">And</a> I'm not going to forget about these, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1652.361s">So</a> if it's no longer a commitment of this administration, just let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1656.802s">So</a> Todd, if you can take that back to the city administration, and if it's not a commitment, then just let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1664.863s">But</a> if it is a commitment, then these two are a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1668.664s">Residents</a> have been waiting four to five years on these, and we have to come out whether or not the pilot program is successful or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1675.666s">And</a> my idea, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1678.367s">This</a> is not something novel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1679.707s">This</a> is being done in many other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1682.449s">A</a> raised crosswalk puts you at a higher height, at a level with oncoming traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1688.032s">They're</a> very, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1692.83s">From</a> a distance you can see them, they're very visually pleasing from a distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1699.194s">And</a> they do provide safety in areas that we know are highly traveled and high rates of speed on those streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1708.14s">And</a> if it provides safety for the community, whether it's $5 or $50,000, we just talked about shoveling sidewalks and creating a new ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1717.626s">It's</a> worth every penny, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1720.688s">I</a> know we want to make it look like we're everywhere in the community and putting these blinking signs up, which I may add, Mr. President, go by any blinking light. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1731.244s">And</a> let me tell you, half the side's not blinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1734.205s">Some</a> of it's blinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1735.085s">Some</a> of it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1736.165s">But</a> these are pretty new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1737.666s">And</a> I don't know if the city goes around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1739.606s">A</a> lot of them are malfunctioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1741.607s">Or</a> they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1742.507s">Or</a> they're cheaper ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1743.448s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1744.208s">But</a> they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1745.808s">They're</a> not serving their intended purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1748.089s">So</a> I would ask that the <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1751.97s">And</a> this is no reflection, again, on the city and traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1755.371s">I</a> think he's doing a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1757.232s">But</a> there has to be more follow-up in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1760.993s">So</a> I would ask, in the form of a motion, that we get an update on the two crosswalks, Central Ave and Harvard Street, whether there's still a commitment in the time frame, and that the other blinking lights that are throughout the community that were recently put in, that the city go around and audit them to see why a lot of them are malfunctioning.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1822.611s">If</a> we could just add language on the commitment for raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1827.315s">I</a> know I said a lot of stuff, but that's important because that was a commitment made by a previous administration, and that should be honored.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=4050.789s">Mr.</a> President, too, while we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=4053.671s">Back</a> in June during the budget period, I asked Alicia Hunt to give us an update on municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=4062.775s">I</a> believe it was in the form of a committee of the whole where we can sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=4067.677s">We</a> have yet to get any formal response from the city administration, and it's been well over a year with municipal aggregation, and I think it's only <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=4078.278s">fitting</a> that where that was an automatic opt-in program where every resident was opted into the energy aggregation in the community that we receive an update on where we stand on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=4094.036s">So</a> I would ask that we set up a committee of the whole <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=4096.879s">Pretty</a> quickly, it's been several months now, and I would ask that we set up a committee of the whole with Alicia Hunt to get an update on the program.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2009.752s">Mr.</a> President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2010.713s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2013.193s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Ryan and Sue for their detailed presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2021.536s">I</a> have a couple of questions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2025.237s">One,</a> if maybe we can get back to that first rendering of the building and the screening that was discussed by Ryan.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2054.698s">The</a> screening itself, so that's the initial concept, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2060.24s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2061.661s">And</a> that can't be accomplished because of concerns with the fire department, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2069.464s">Okay,</a> and the second rendering, that one right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2075.807s">So</a> the unconnected screens, what was the reasoning why this couldn't be accomplished?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2108.075s">Okay,</a> so I guess the concerns that I've received, Ryan, just so you know, is that I guess what the hospital's pushing for is to actually just paint the electrical box, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2129.009s">Right,</a> but clearly there's a huge difference, aesthetically speaking, from your initial proposal to this current rendering here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2137.878s">And</a> I can see why area residents would have some concern with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2142.483s">Is</a> there any way to make the exterior, I can appreciate the fact that our fire department may need access and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2150.493s">And</a> I don't want to block access or go against their recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2154.659s">But</a> is there any way we can make this more aesthetically pleasing? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2159.365s">Because</a> right now it just looks like a giant gray, what I would refer to as icebox. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2166.59s">And</a> the exterior of the building looks beautiful, the frontage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2171.434s">And</a> that, in my opinion, sticks out like a sore thumb. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2174.757s">So</a> I was hoping that maybe the hospital can circle the wagons back and come out with a couple more renderings on other alternatives to just painting that icebox. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2188.227s">that</a> would be aesthetically pleasing for the neighbors and something that I think would fit into the new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2195.593s">So</a> if that's something that the hospital can do, can you speak to that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2258.563s">Right,</a> so why can't we put some type of screening right onto that mechanical box? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2265.147s">Something</a> that's aesthetically pleasing like the second proposal or maybe some type of building material that could be affixed to the box itself rather than just painting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2279.374s">because</a> your initial plan, I'm sure, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2282.796s">was</a> costing tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to cover that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2289.318s">I'm</a> not sure why we can't take a look at putting something else there that would be pleasing to the neighbors and Director Butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2298.421s">So</a> I would ask that that be taken into consideration and that you provide a couple of more proposals other than just the painting of the electrical box itself.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2377.102s">Okay,</a> I'd appreciate it if you can work on that with the CAG group, as well as area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2384.306s">My</a> second question is regarding the exterior of the building, and in particular, the bottom lower part of the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2393.072s">Do</a> you have any renderings of that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2404.399s">So</a> the front of the building there, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2408.408s">Well,</a> now the other rendering, the other construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2413.011s">Is</a> that a wood slat there, or is that brick?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2461.274s">So</a> is it like a brick master, like a terracotta that's carved in? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2468.059s">Is</a> that what that is?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2502.931s">You</a> said it was a terracotta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2504.172s">I</a> was wondering if it's similar to like a simulated brick master where they put a layer of cement down and then carve the design that they want to carve into the terracotta or cement, whatever the substance is.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2530.849s">Is</a> the intent to look like brick? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2532.689s">Is</a> that the intent?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2549.154s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2550.911s">Okay,</a> it doesn't blend in much to me, but if that's what you guys arrived at, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2558.215s">My</a> other point I have is regarding, as you know, Ryan, you've been involved with this since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2565.059s">A</a> lot of the direct abutters going up Governor's Ave, there was a lot of discussion in the back of your parking lot, the second lot, regarding fencing, shrubbery, trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2578.467s">I</a> know that was part of your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2580.768s">The</a> home at 216 Governor's Ave has completely no barrier at all from your parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2589.031s">And</a> I was originally under the impression when we were looking at providing a barrier between the neighbors, whether it was plantings or fencing, that that was part of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2600.956s">Are</a> they not going to put fencing next to 216 Governor's Ave, which would separate your parking lot, a very busy parking lot, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2610.279s">from</a> the residents.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2661.773s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2662.653s">I</a> would ask respectfully, Lawrence Memorial has been great during this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2666.734s">We've</a> come a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2668.174s">And</a> I would ask in the interest of being a good neighbor that I believe it's roughly 100 feet of fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2677.657s">that</a> Lawrence Memorial make a commitment to extend that fence so we don't have a neighbor that's completely open to headlights and noise and everything else that's going to be associated with the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2695.169s">And</a> I would ask that Lawrence Memorial make a commitment to work with the neighbor at 216 to put up a fence, a barrier, in the interest of being a good neighbor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2743.519s">Okay,</a> so I take that that sounds like that you will put a fence up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2754.301s">Okay,</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2756.482s">And</a> just my last point, I know my colleagues have questions also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2760.625s">During</a> this entire process, some of the concerns within the neighborhood and the direct abutters was speeding cars, additional signage, pedestrian crossings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2775.073s">And</a> I know much of which involves city input, the traffic commission, the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2781.559s">Has</a> there been any steps with Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the Method Police Department or Traffic Commission to work on some of these concerns regarding speeding and pedestrian safety?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2819.967s">Okay,</a> and do you have anything you could publicly share with us at a later date on what's being proposed and what's being worked on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2845.418s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=2846.439s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3200.055s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3202.257s">I</a> just would like to put my three recommendations in the form of a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3207.342s">The</a> first one would be that two additional renderings of the electrical box <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3213.749s">and</a> other alternatives aesthetically pleasing would be provided to the CAG group and to the city council, as well as neighbors and direct abutters, and that a fence be installed between the properties, between the parking lot and 216 Governor's Ave, a full fence, and that as soon as <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3239.847s">the</a> discussions had with the police department and the traffic commission regarding public safety, pedestrian safety, and speeding, as well as signage, that those discussions be presented to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3257.679s">So</a> those three in the form of a motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6446.766s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6447.727s">I</a> want to thank Marianne for her commitment to this city over the last seven months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6453.65s">It's</a> been very trying, and she's been a leader in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6457.312s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6458.853s">Marianne,</a> have you had any involvement with the outside rentals of our school buildings?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6492.56s">Okay,</a> so what type of contact tracing is being done by the city or what systems are in place to monitor the size of the groups and the purpose of which they're using our buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6507.711s">Is</a> that being done by your office or is that being done, it is?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6578.539s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6579.319s">Is</a> there any actual testing COVID testing being required?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6587.987s">So</a> we don't know if we're welcoming anyone from an outside group into our buildings that may be infected.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6619.198s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6619.398s">What</a> about a temperature test? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6622.213s">taking</a> someone's temperature.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6643.537s">So</a> as the health director, and I don't mean to put you on the spot, and if you don't want to answer, you don't have to, but what's your personal thought about entertaining activities in a building we're trying to lock down for safety reasons, inviting people from the public into these buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6664.331s">What's</a> your personal thought on that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6748.702s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6750.28s">So</a> Mary, just so I understand, and I don't want to beat a dead horse, but if we had an issue of a student contracting COVID that we know was, or a teacher, or faculty, whoever it might be, that was in the Marsha Karen Little Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6766.491s">And</a> the previous day, there was, or the day after, there was 75 people from an outside organization using the Marsha Karen Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6779.62s">contact</a> every person that we have on record that was in that particular part of the building.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6799.934s">Well,</a> what about in a particular area?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6843.676s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6844.417s">So</a> that doesn't make you eligible for contact tracing, although it could make you eligible for getting the COVID virus, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6884.337s">So</a> you wouldn't be concerned the following day that students may be using that exact room?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7034.199s">Just</a> one last follow up to Mary Ann. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7036.8s">Maybe</a> if Mary Ann can provide us over the next week or so, Mr. President, just the number of organizations, what building they're using, the capacity of the numbers that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7052.125s">And</a> I don't need to see names, but I would like to see how many people use in the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7057.088s">And</a> I would like to see what the protocol is for these groups, Mr. President, regarding the contact tracing, the availability of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7069.253s">And</a> as I stated in the past, Mr. President, during COVID, to me, doesn't make any sense at all to invite people that would never typically be in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7079.858s">into</a> a building that we're trying to secure for our faculty and our teachers and our students, that we're trying to safeguard and secure, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7089.483s">It</a> makes no sense why you would want to invite that at that particular time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7094.386s">I</a> realize it's a revenue generator, but safety should come first, as the Board of Health Director mentioned, and that doesn't seem like safety first to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7103.091s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8199.801s">Mr.</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8207.083s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, the first amendment shows the exact ordinance that states the two different historic districts, Hillside Ave and Myram Simmons Historic District. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8219.093s">And</a> the amendment two, which we would be voting on, is the addition of foster court. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8225.378s">So</a> I'm not quite sure why you would sever it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8228.02s">I</a> don't think it matters, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8232.495s">I</a> don't think it has any bearing on the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8234.756s">I'd</a> rather, Mr. President, hear about the meeting that was held last night and find out the great news about moving forward on the proposal that we put forward, Mr. President, with the owner of the property and the historical district commission regarding an agreement, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8409.512s">For</a> point of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8460.03s">Just</a> past practice, Mr. President, any paper that has been submitted by any mayor previously, we never had the authority to amend or change, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8470.375s">So</a> I'm not sure why this would be any different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8474.217s">So</a> I don't think we have the authority to change a paper submitted from the administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8483.381s">On</a> countless issues, whether it's monetary or not, Mr. President, we've never had the ability to change the mayor's papers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8578.641s">Mr.</a> President, do we have any of the property owner or the- We do, we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8583.745s">Members</a> of the Historical District Commission on it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8592.891s">Whichever</a> way you choose, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8906.598s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President, just if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8908.821s">Yes,</a> Mr. Bader, one minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8909.943s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Larkins. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8912.206s">Not</a> to interrupt, Mr. President, but I really want to understand this because the way I understood it was we were looking at saving the facade of the structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8922.339s">And</a> there was some discussion whether or not it was going to be to the roof line or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8927.503s">And</a> the renderings that I saw gave two different versions, one to the roof ridge and the other one just below the roof ridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8935.87s">And</a> so I'm kind of not sure what Mr. Bader is talking about, unless he can give me some more information about why it wasn't acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8946.159s">Because</a> we were all there at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8949.421s">And</a> we thought we were moving forward on an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8954.923s">And</a> now to hear that it's not acceptable is a little troubling, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8983.98s">So</a> Mr. President, based on the discussions that we had, the initial discussions, I was wondering if Mr. Bader can get into more detail from what we spoke about originally as an agreement to what the disapproval is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9004.377s">And</a> I understand he's saying it's based on architects and other people, but <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9012.028s">Did</a> the petitioner not present in those renderings? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9017.191s">If</a> I could just finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9018.672s">If</a> I could just finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9020.053s">Mr.</a> Bader, Mr. Bader, one minute, Councilor Locke has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9022.815s">If</a> I could just finish, Mr. Bader. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9024.576s">No,</a> that's all right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9026.397s">I</a> just want to understand this because we put a lot of time and effort into coming to what I thought was an agreement to save a piece of historical property and also, Mr. President, move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9037.544s">on</a> creating what I would consider additional housing in the area, which was a win-win situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9046.448s">So</a> I am extremely disappointed to hear if that doesn't come to fruition tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9052.251s">But</a> I would like to hear more about why the two renderings that were presented, which to me address the exact issue that we were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9062.275s">I</a> remember Mr. Hayward at the meeting, I asked him point blank, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9066.037s">about</a> the windows on either side of the roof line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9070.06s">I</a> asked him about the chimney, and at the point, he said they didn't have, and I won't speak for him, but there was no real historical significance, and he didn't even see a reason to save the chimney and the two windows on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9086.473s">So</a> I really would like to know a little more why this is not acceptable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9092.008s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9092.848s">Mr.</a> Bader, please continue.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11128.973s">From</a> what I recall, Mr. President, as part of the discussions that took place at the site, in addition, Mr. President, to agreeing that the owner of the property would come back with a couple of schematics of potential designs to save the front facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11149.93s">It</a> was also mentioned at that meeting, Mr. President, that there would be no pursuit of the creation of a local historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11158.908s">And</a> that was part of the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11160.97s">Now,</a> I know Ryan Haywood is on the phone, and I know he doesn't speak for the Historical District Commission, but I think the Historic District Commission should realize what was proposed at that particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11173.28s">And</a> it wasn't horse trading that took place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11176.523s">This</a> was an open public meeting that anyone was welcome to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11180.826s">And</a> I'm really surprised that some members of the Historical District Commission only found their way to this particular property within the last few days after this being around for 18 months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11193.29s">And</a> that's even more alarming to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11195.61s">Secondly,</a> Mr. President, from what we heard tonight, the Historical District Commission has no say, Mr. President, in whether or not they like the rendering or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11207.776s">They</a> have no say in that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11210.077s">That's</a> what we heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11212.498s">So</a> the vote that they took Monday night, I'm confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11216.58s">Was</a> that a vote against the rendering or was that a vote to accept the mayor's revised ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11223.883s">I'm</a> a little confused, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11226.484s">Chris,</a> could you please clarify for Councilor Marks?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11273.114s">So,</a> Chris, just so I understand, what was the actual vote last night then?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11295.006s">Okay,</a> so I was under the impression that there was a vote taken not to accept the two renderings from the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11325.695s">So,</a> at this particular point, Mr. President, I'd like to hear from Ryan Haywood from the historic commission, and then also hear from the petitioner once again, Mr. President, because I know he had additional information to present.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11362.721s">My</a> question was, Ryan was present during this entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11368.266s">And</a> I didn't know if he had any interaction the day after that we spoke about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11375.832s">Did</a> he have any interactions with any members of the Historical District Commission in regards to what was presented and somewhat agreed upon at the time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11386.701s">I</a> know he had no authority to agree on behalf of another group, but I'd like to know a little more, Mr. President, about what took place on this, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11479.17s">Ryan,</a> if I could, was there not mentioned at the Committee of the Whole site review that if the renderings were acceptable, that there wouldn't be a pursuit of the creation of a local historic district?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11531.357s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11532.097s">Now,</a> did you just say Historic Commission?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11544.423s">So</a> when did the Historic Commission meet to review the drawings?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11572.254s">And</a> that was the opinion of the historic commission, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11577.538s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11670.795s">Mr.</a> President, if we could hear from the petitioner and whatever he'd like to present as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11677.822s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12965.339s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12966.32s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13043.884s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13045.865s">I</a> know contracts and negotiations between the administration and the unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13050.627s">I</a> would just ask if we can get an update on any current outstanding unsettled contracts within the city of Medford.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13201.618s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13202.659s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for co-sponsoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13206.062s">We</a> actually both offered this, it was probably a little over a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13210.586s">DPW</a> was kind enough to go up to Winslow Ave and fill some of the many, many potholes that are lined in that stretch between 69 and 77 Winslow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13223.216s">However,</a> Mr. President, I think we're at a time where we probably could use some <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13227.76s">curb-to-curb</a> paving, even though one side of the street I don't believe has curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13234.486s">I</a> would say, Mr. President, at this particular point, it's a small stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13238.929s">It's</a> near Carpac. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13240.931s">It's</a> a very heavy traveled area, as you know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13244.434s">So</a> I would ask in the interest of public safety that that area be ground down between 69 and 77 Winslow Ave and repave curb-to-curb in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13986.359s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13990.503s">There</a> are many good aspects to this particular ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13995.228s">With</a> that being said, there are very many aspects of this ordinance that need to be revamped, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14003.155s">And</a> I just would like to bring up a few because I think we all are concerned about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14009.781s">But</a> we also don't want to be punitive in regards to getting something accomplished as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14017.243s">This</a> particular ordinance would differ from the current ordinance because right now homeowners wouldn't be responsible for clearing out pedestrian crossings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14027.526s">So</a> if you happen to live at an intersection or if you live at a corner house, you would be responsible for shoveling the pedestrian pathway leading across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14038.163s">So</a> you'd be responsible for clearing out the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14042.233s">Those</a> of us who own homes and have shoveled for decades in this community realize that the city, and I hope this doesn't reflect poorly, but the city does a poor job cleaning corners up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14056.782s">And</a> there is no snow removal, there's only snow piling on city corners and intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14064.446s">And</a> I can just attest, Mr. President, moving five to six feet of packed snow from a snow plow would be an insurmountable task for residents to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14077.433s">And</a> especially if you have, like we did a few years ago, snowstorm after snowstorm after snowstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14083.417s">So</a> that would be the first concern I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14087.299s">I</a> believe it's important to create the connectivity for pedestrian paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14092.822s">I'm</a> not quite sure that this alleviates that by making homeowners responsible for that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14100.2s">Also,</a> this ordinance states, failure to comply within 24 hours of receiving a notice, the city may remove the snow and ice and charge the owner for the removal as a lien on the owner's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14116.514s">That</a> currently does not exist right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14118.716s">So</a> this is saying if you don't remove it within 24 hours, the city has the ability to come in and put a lien on your tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14127.984s">I'm</a> not sure if that's legally binding, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14132.613s">And</a> I guess when we get subcommittee, we can have that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14136.787s">Also,</a> Mr. President, it doesn't state at what expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14141.831s">So</a> if I happen to be, just say I'm a snowbird and I'm in Florida for three or four days, and I realize that's my property and I'm responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14150.917s">But</a> if I don't attend to a particular storm, Mr. President, the city may hire someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14158.182s">There's</a> no set fee in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14160.982s">And</a> you can bet your bottom dollar the city doesn't have the resources to go out and shovel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14165.464s">So</a> they would be hiring someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14167.565s">That</a> could be at a great expense to residents, to hire someone for $300, $400, $500 to shovel, depending on the amount and so forth, and to put sand and salt down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14178.369s">So</a> this doesn't make any mention about the cost to homeowners if the city does opt <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14184.591s">to</a> go out at their homeowner's expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14187.173s">So</a> that's a concern I have, Mr. President, because I'm very mindful regarding people in our community, in particular seniors that are struggling on fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14197.48s">And</a> every little increase, Mr. President, as we know, is a matter of if someone can stay in their home or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14204.484s">And</a> I would hate to create an ordinance that may put someone in jeopardy of losing their home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14212.51s">The</a> escalating fines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14215.191s">The</a> current ordinance doesn't call for escalating fines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14218.572s">So</a> the first offense for noncompliance is a $50 a day fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14224.573s">And</a> then for each subsequent offense, within 12 months, so that covers the full snow time, within 12 months, the fine or charge shall double. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14237.236s">That's</a> not in the existing ordinance to double fines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14241.311s">So</a> let's take an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14243.112s">Let's</a> look at the first offense, $50 a day, you go out there and shovel immediately so you only get charged for one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14253.598s">The</a> second time it happens, which could be the next day, the following day, the following week within a snow period, who knows, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14262.863s">That</a> fine then goes, if you don't shovel, to $100 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14268.826s">Say</a> you're that unfortunate that it happened to you three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14272.247s">Just</a> say you were in the hospital, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14274.908s">And</a> the third time, the fine is $200 a day for homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14280.91s">And</a> if you were really unfortunate, the next subsequent fine would be $400 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14289.133s">So</a> if you didn't get out there for five days, the homeowner would get a $2,000 bill, according to this ordinance, because they didn't shovel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14298.464s">Excessive?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14299.624s">I</a> would say so, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14302.085s">So</a> that's another concern I have with these subsequent offenses and the doubling of fines, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14308.846s">We</a> all want to keep our sidewalks clear, but I think there's a way to do it, Mr. President, when we're not putting a stranglehold on residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14319.988s">There</a> are no provisions, as Councilor Bears mentioned, to, and I'm glad he did, to assist seniors or disabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14328.806s">I</a> have a senior mother that lives alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14331.648s">I</a> can tell you firsthand, Mr. President, over the last several years, and I try to be a good son, but I can't get out there all the time, it is next to impossible to find someone to come out and shovel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14343.914s">The</a> days of people like we used to do when we were younger, going out, knocking the door, you don't find that anymore, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14351.038s">It</a> doesn't happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14353.639s">So</a> it's not as readily available. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14355.54s">I</a> know the senior center has a list of people, and I tapped into that list, and it just wasn't consistent enough, to be quite frank with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14364.063s">It</a> was great they offered, but it wasn't enough in the case for my mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14368.245s">And</a> I know there's a lot of my mothers out there in this community, and there's a lot of disabled people, Mr. President, that would have to rely on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14378.22s">The</a> ordinance also states, and this is both ordinances, the old and the new, whenever snow or ice accumulates on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14387.205s">No</a> mention the amount of ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14389.926s">How</a> many times, Mr. President, do you look outside and say, is that an inch? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14393.427s">Is</a> that a half an inch? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14394.367s">Do</a> I need to go out there and shovel? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14396.628s">Do</a> I not need to shovel? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14397.968s">How</a> many times does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14399.589s">Should</a> I put down ice? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14400.349s">Should</a> I not? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14401.069s">How</a> many times does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14402.45s">No</a> mention at all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14404.45s">So</a> it's very possible you could be debating with your wife whether you should be out there shoveling or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14411.237s">There's</a> no mention what the accumulation is, and the city defines it as, you know what, we believe you should have shoveled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14418.943s">It</a> doesn't say one inch, two inch, three inch, like I believe it should say, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14424.427s">And</a> then you may get a fine based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14427.429s">So</a> that's another issue in here, Mr. President, that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14437.011s">About</a> a year ago, Mr. President, I asked the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14441.775s">I</a> did a lot of research into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14444.298s">And</a> other states, I didn't find many communities around here, but I'm sure it's done, create what they call a priority street sidewalk listing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14455.95s">And</a> they put funds aside, and many of them have to hire private contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14461.114s">But</a> they put funds aside for every snowstorm greater than three inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14465.838s">The</a> city sits down with the DPW and residents and stakeholders and say, this is our ten miles of priority sidewalk in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14475.827s">And</a> most of the time, it's the major federal fears. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14478.689s">And</a> what that does is create a connection, a linkage, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14483.493s">In</a> the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14485.335s">So</a> you would go down High Street would be done, Main Street would be done, Salem Street would be done, Fulton Street would be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14492.064s">All</a> riverside out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14493.626s">The</a> major areas, Mr. President, I throw ten miles out there because that's probably reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14498.992s">It</a> may take more, it may take less. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14501.195s">But</a> I asked the administration back a year ago to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14504.736s">Because</a> if we really want to provide safety in this community, for kids that are walking to school, right now there may not be many kids walking to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14513.019s">But</a> for seniors, for people with disabilities, for anyone in general, Mr. President, what better to know and be reassured that every fall of snow that's greater than a certain amount, whether it's two or three inches, that those priority sidewalks will be done by a bombardier. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14530.103s">And</a> if the city can't handle it, which I don't think we have the ability to right now, we would subcontract for it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14536.848s">Some</a> of the figures I looked at in some communities were upwards of $160,000, $170,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14540.671s">But</a> if we're going to prioritize the importance, Mr. President, of doing the shoveling, opening up our sidewalks, making sure they're safe, making sure people don't walk in the streets, that's a small price to pay, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14558.965s">So</a> I would ask that in the form of a motion once again, because it fell on deaf ears in the last administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14565.13s">It's</a> a great concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14566.531s">I</a> didn't create this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14568.152s">This</a> is being done in a lot of communities around the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14573.336s">The</a> second thing, Mr. President, would be on the lines of Councilor Bears, to have more of a full-fledged program where we deal with seniors and people with disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14586.465s">That</a> way, Mr. President, we're not leaving this up to chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14590.353s">We're</a> not leaving it up to whether or not someone can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14593.179s">Because</a> this is an affordability issue too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14598.467s">And</a> I would ask in the form of a motion that the city also create, and I'm not sure if we could do it by ordinance or policy, create a program where we assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14608.872s">If</a> we're going to implement ordinances that create escalating fines and doubling fines and shoving corners and so forth, that we assist the neediest in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14620.273s">which</a> are the seniors in our disabled population. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14624.314s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I would also ask that if we're going to make it the responsibility of residents to clean corners, clean hydrants out, the fire department has a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14638.157s">They</a> have a volunteer program, if you go on the firefighters website, where they go on and ask if people want to assist in clearing out hydrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14646.147s">And</a> the firefighters do a tremendous job, let me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14649.209s">They're</a> out there in every snowstorm cleaning out hydrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14652.131s">This</a> ordinance requires residents to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14655.354s">I'm</a> not opposed to that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14657.395s">But</a> what I'm saying is, if we're going to require residents now to be responsible for a public sidewalk, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14663.8s">A</a> public sidewalk, you don't own that sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14666.901s">You</a> can't do any alterations to that sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14669.743s">And</a> now we're requesting that you keep it a certain distance wide open. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14674.685s">We're</a> requesting during certain hours of daylight that you have to shovel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14678.886s">If</a> not, you get fined. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14680.227s">I</a> think at the very least, Mr. President, the city should have some responsibility for cutting away snow at intersections and corners of streets where they intersect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14692.694s">The</a> complaints I receive constantly, more than complaints of someone just not shoveling, are the ability for people to cross from street to street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14702.699s">That</a> seems to be the major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14705.64s">And</a> we have to create some systematic approach in the community where we don't just pile, we remove. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14712.964s">And</a> that's going to be a large endeavor with seven square miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14715.725s">This</a> is a big city, this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14717.266s">I</a> would venture to say thousands of corners. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14721.067s">But</a> we have to have a better way of addressing this than saying, sorry homeowner, you're responsible for every pedestrian crossing and every intersection of streets and every corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14733.318s">Now</a> you're responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14736.04s">Sounds</a> good in theory? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14738.062s">It</a> doesn't work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14739.583s">And</a> if we truly want to put something together, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14743.82s">that</a> addresses the issue, those are the discussions we have to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14748.802s">And</a> I'm willing to have them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14750.702s">I</a> like the fact that this makes homeowners responsible and not tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14755.004s">I</a> agree, chasing after a tenant, many days now you have two, three, four, five people living in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14760.786s">No</a> one's going to claim responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14762.686s">They're</a> all paying a certain amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14765.007s">It</a> would be a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14766.468s">So</a> I agree with aspects of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14769.429s">But</a> I also want to make sure we put something that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14773.55s">And</a> something that's not punitive, Mr. President, to homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14777.473s">And</a> some of this in here, I believe, is punitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14780.635s">And</a> I think we can address it, but I want to make sure, whatever discussions I had, that these three items, and I offer them in the form of a motion, that the city expand, the last one, the city expand their plowing to include snow and ice removal on all pedestrian crossings along with corners and intersections.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14802.189s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14803.089s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14835.426s">With</a> shoveling services, correct.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14853.413s">All</a> pedestrian crossings, corners, and intersections, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14858.394s">Okay?</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14862.035s">Right,</a> so the first one would be the city create a priority sidewalks listing of responsible sidewalks for plowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14876.118s">And</a> I put of snow greater than three inches, but that could be up for deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14881.439s">That</a> was just for discussion purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14884.21s">So</a> the city create a priority sidewalk listing where they shovel, plow all the major sidewalk, dental affairs.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14898.577s">Within</a> the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14899.457s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14905.26s">It</a> doesn't matter, whatever.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15321.624s">Just</a> a point of information, what subcommittee is that, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15328.006s">And</a> we have one in public safety?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15369.065s">And</a> you have full body of the membership too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15372.898s">Maybe</a> worthwhile.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16833.16s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16835.321s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16836.262s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for co-sponsoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16839.365s">Everyone</a> behind this railing has supported one way or another that particular intersection in improving the pedestrian safety there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16847.811s">This</a> is the first encouraging news since I've been on this council regarding that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16854.156s">So</a> I'm going to take it at face value, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16856.899s">If</a> they're adding it to their list, I'm encouraged by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16860.162s">I</a> look forward to working with DOT in rectifying that whole length of stretch of road to increase safety, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16870.771s">As</a> Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I did sit on a call last night with Eversource, and they discussed the Eversource project on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16881.18s">And</a> Main Street in particular, they discussed that one of their major concerns with doing the excavating and so forth, was that no matter what they tried to do to slow down traffic on South, that they were unable to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16897.465s">And</a> it was actually very enlightening to hear, Mr. President, that what we've been talking about for so many years in residents and abutters, we're hearing from a construction company saying, hey, this is a dangerous stretch of road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16913.254s">And</a> indeed, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, they approached the Chief of Police and the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16920.358s">And</a> they saw fit to put some temporary speed bumps in order to slow down traffic, which we've been asking for, I can't tell you how long. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16931.087s">And</a> we were told, you can't impede the flow of traffic, you can't do this, you can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16937.032s">It's</a> amazing what can take place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16939.294s">But</a> this is tremendous news and I would like to actually maybe as a council through the administration just follow up to make sure we can secure this commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16952.345s">And</a> maybe that may be from a motion from this council asking what we can do as a community to get this ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16961.914s">put</a> that in the form of a motion that the city administration as well as the chief of police and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16969.414s">The</a> city engineer and the council send a letter to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16974.238s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16999.773s">Do</a> you want to do it now or? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17003.636s">No,</a> that's fine.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17292.273s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17294.445s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17295.225s">I</a> want to thank Council Vice President Caraviello for co-sponsoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17299.787s">I'd</a> like to ask several questions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17302.828s">I</a> know we're going to request a committee of the whole meeting, but I'd like to know what potential disclosure of information was contained and what personal information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17316.014s">I'd</a> like to know why no police report was issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17322.42s">The</a> city stated they took all available steps to prevent further disclosure and fully investigated this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17329.847s">I'd</a> like to know, Mr. President, what steps were taken by the city to prevent further disclosure? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17337.995s">And</a> what came out of the investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17344.349s">And</a> Mr. President, just as a note, the President of the Teachers Union filed a green sheet which seeks legal advice on the breach of personal information by school employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17358.457s">So</a> I think that shows you how serious the nature is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17362.82s">And</a> I think it deserves and warrants more than just an email to us saying that the city looked into this and took steps to prevent further disclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17373.886s">So</a> I would hope that we get more information, Mr. President, on behalf of city employees in this community to make sure their valuable personal information is not compromised. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17386.238s">If</a> I can, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17480.081s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17481.562s">This</a> is on the border of the Arlington Method Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17484.904s">And</a> from what I'm being told, it's been a very dangerous intersection for pedestrians, bikers for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17493.109s">So</a> I would ask in the interest of public safety, where we're looking at snow ordinance for sidewalk and other traffic calming initiatives, that DCR also look at traffic calming initiatives for pedestrian crossings at that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17509.738s">intersection</a> as well as bike-friendly crossings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17513.701s">That's</a> a very difficult road that takes in three or four different avenues and is extremely dangerous for people that are using the Mystic Lakes or walking in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17527.649s">and</a> for passive use, and I would ask that we meet with our state delegation or presenters to the state delegation so they can present it to DCR to look for some traffic calming initiatives.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17684.443s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17685.624s">Anyone</a> that knew Joanne Caputo, she was a sweetheart of a woman, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17690.845s">She</a> was known as the mayor of 99 and 101 Riverside Ave to many of her fellow residents in those two buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17700.268s">She</a> was just a spitfire of a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17704.03s">She</a> was very active in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17706.111s">She</a> cared an awful lot for the seniors in those two buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17710.853s">And</a> she watched over them, Mr. President, and just had a real guiding effect on many of the seniors in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17720.337s">You</a> couldn't go to an event, whether it was the meat bingo or whatever else they were doing in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17728.34s">She</a> was always part of what took place, she was always in the center of things, and she was always looking out for the residents of that 99 and 101 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17738.808s">And</a> I would ask Mr. President that this meeting be dedicated in her memory, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17744.673s">She</a> will be sorely missed.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18348.868s">So</a> what we're doing is asking that the building department notify residents once they have the review back from the historical commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18359.557s">That</a> they notify residents within 72 hours, is that how I'm reading this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18435.609s">I</a> am, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18872.972s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18874.213s">Mr.</a> President, this may seem like a trivial issue, but this is the second time I've offered this on the agenda, and neighbors up on Mangels Street are worried enough to bring it to my attention again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18887.877s">I</a> requested that National Grid go up and take a look at it and report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18893.059s">I'm</a> not a structural engineer, but my eyes don't deceive me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18900.971s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18902.272s">And</a> it's quite dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18904.153s">And</a> this is a poll that carries electrical wires as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18907.535s">And</a> neighbors are very concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18909.916s">So,</a> I, as one member of the council, if I don't get a response, I will not be supporting any issues that come before us with National Grid requests, Mr. President, until they adhere to our request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18922.643s">And</a> that's true with double polls as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18924.904s">If</a> you go around the city now, you're going to see more and more double polls creeping up around this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18930.734s">And</a> unless we fight back, they're going to say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18933.736s">You</a> can get away with it in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18936.277s">And</a> so I would ask, Mr. President, that our head of wires, Steve Rendazzo, who does a tremendous job, reach out to National Grid and get a response immediately regarding pole 4354 on Mangles Street in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18988.316s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18991.72s">that</a> I bring this up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18995.245s">Louise</a> was a dear, close friend to not only myself, but many, many people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19001.955s">Louise</a> served her distinction with the Method Arts Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19007.794s">Incorporated</a> for many, many years, many of the projects that you've seen around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19013.016s">Louise</a> Musto Cho was very involved, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19017.398s">She</a> was a sweetheart of a woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19019.818s">She</a> was dedicated to her family, her friends, and her arts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19025.941s">If</a> you know Louise, she was a jewelry designer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19029.182s">She</a> did tapestry, canvas prints, artwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19033.916s">She</a> was a very creative person, Mr. President, and was always looking to put the city first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19039.838s">Over</a> the past few years, I had the opportunity to serve on a citizen-initiated arts center committee, which she was kind enough to let us use her building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19056.374s">a</a> group of people to use their building in the community room to meet and gather and discuss a potential art center for the entire community at the Heckner Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19066.671s">And</a> the loss of Louise is truly devastating for this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19147.846s">Mr.</a> President, if I just could, I omitted, I put Councilor Caraviello's name on the, we had a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19156.893s">I</a> put his name on the email that I sent to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19161.777s">I</a> may have spelled his name wrong, but I did put, and I just want to recognize Councilor Caraviello offered that with me as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19172.205s">So</a> I apologize for the omission.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19240.068s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19262.302s">I</a> reviewed the records, find them to be in order, and I do move approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19279.704s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19313.772s">Happy</a> Wednesday.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19323.182s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_dQwFkF1-J44/2024-11-19_dQwFkF1-J44.html">City Council 09-22-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=556.054s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=557.195s">I,</a> too, want to reiterate my support for Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=561.479s">They've</a> been longstanding members of this community, very active and involved in this community, and good neighbors for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=570.127s">And</a> I stand here tonight, Mr. President, to support them as they've supported members of this community for the last several decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=577.754s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1069.541s">Mr.</a> President, does the owner of the property have plans to turn the sign off after hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1077.327s">Mr.</a> Parris, can you comment on that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1097.758s">I</a> would state, Mr. President, to be consistent, and I've voted like this in the past, that the sign be turned off when the business is not in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1106.772s">Okay,</a> are you writing that as an amendment to the- I would like to hear what my other council colleagues would like to say on that, and I would have that as an amendment, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1190.485s">So</a> I would ask with consistency, Mr. President, that the light be turned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1194.187s">If</a> the audience is 10, that's fine.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1201.31s">I</a> don't want to come across- I just want to be consistent, because I know when station landing came aboard, we spent a lot of time working on the signage to make sure that it was aesthetically pleasing, because there are a number of residents that live in station landing.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1216.816s">And</a> we have to be mindful of that as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1225.661s">I</a> would say that it conforms with the existing sign ordinance, which I believe Councilman Knight is correct, that 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1232.006s">the</a> sign be turned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1232.946s">10</a> p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1234.527s">10</a> p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1235.208s">10</a> p.m.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1574.819s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I happen to frequent this car wash where I live right up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1582.441s">And</a> let me tell you, there's no mistaking that there's free vacuum at that particular car wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1589.483s">There</a> is banners on the fence, there are signs everywhere saying free car wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1596.866s">You</a> can't help but drive by, I mean a free vacuum, and notice that there's free vacuuming there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1603.869s">I</a> would also state that these particular awnings, according to the letter we received that Councilor Knight just read, state that the awnings come off the building two feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1616.129s">So</a> to state that this would be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning, I don't know how you create shade and shelter of a two foot awning coming off the side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1630.914s">Because</a> the vacuum is in front of the car, which is a pretty big, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1636.956s">piece</a> of equipment, there's no way that provides shelter for anyone that's vacuuming, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1644.243s">I</a> think the awnings may be a nice addition to the building without signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1649.868s">So</a> if the gentleman wanted to put 12 awnings and maybe one or two free vacuum, or maybe even three depending on the wish of the council, I would be amendable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1663.461s">Because</a> I think the building could use, it's just a squared off building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1668.368s">Aesthetically</a> speaking, it's not that pleasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1671.232s">Maybe</a> these awnings will make it look more pleasing, but to have it on each awning, Mr. President, is overkill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1679.364s">And</a> it doesn't serve the purpose of shade or shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1682.886s">And</a> so I would put in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that out of the request for 13 canvas awnings, that we allow 13 awnings, but only three with signage that states free vacuum.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1764.474s">Also,</a> if I could, and I realize the banners are probably up temporarily because it doesn't really, other than the banners, there's nothing else that says free vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1776.217s">I</a> would hope as soon as the awnings go up that those temporary banners come off that are on the fence and around the property, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1874.498s">This</a> may be a question for the building commissioner in his office, but I believe any banners in the city, Mr. President, have to be permitted and approved for businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1889.006s">And</a> I believe it's on a temporary basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1891.107s">I'm</a> not sure if these banners are approved or if they, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1897.31s">But</a> I would ask as part of this paper that they be taken down as soon as the awnings go up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1905.749s">Right,</a> I'm not sure if he has current approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1907.771s">Maybe</a> the owner of the property can state whether or not he got approval for the bayonets.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1947.614s">Yeah,</a> so we can leave that language in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1948.935s">He's</a> committing to the language anyway, so we can leave that language in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1953.219s">The</a> banners come down as soon as the signage goes up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2221.864s">Mr.</a> President, does the petitioner have any plans for a freestanding sign as well?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2239.513s">I'll</a> accept that answer, Mr. President, and if they do come back, I may not be supportive of an additional freestanding sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2248.381s">So</a> as long as the petitioner knows that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2653.521s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2656.178s">Are</a> they able to control the lumens on the signage itself?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2700.074s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2701.855s">So</a> we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2704.716s">If</a> we put a 30 or 60 day review, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2708.738s">And</a> after 30 or 60 days, this council sees fit that we received a certain number of complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2715.905s">I'm</a> sure the hotel wouldn't want to remove a $50,000, $60,000 sign based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2722.751s">So</a> I would ask that as part of this, Mr. President, that they put up a sign that they can control the Lumens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2729.798s">And</a> that way, if there is a concern, we may be able to go back to the owner of the property and state that the brightness is bothering people or whatever it might be, and have some flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2741.862s">And</a> that's the only reason why I bring it up, Mr. President, because once the sign goes up, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2746.324s">And</a> if we do vote at a later date to take it down, that would be of great hardship, I'm sure, to the petitioner, and I wouldn't want to put them in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2755.47s">So</a> maybe if they can look at a sign that they can control the lumens, we'll be able to address any issues, because that would be my issue, the brightness of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2764.356s">I</a> understand the petitioner saying they're not that bright, but if they're able to get a sign where they can control that one in particular, not all of them, that one in particular I think would be helpful for not only them, but for us as a council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2800.865s">So</a> I'd ask that that be part of the recommendation, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2805.488s">An</a> amendment that the sign contain a dimming aspect on the north, facing the north side. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2810.771s">So</a> I'd ask Councilor Knight to amend his motion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5837.805s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5839.366s">I</a> just want to thank members of the historic commission that were present there last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5845.49s">I</a> want to thank the property owner and, Mr. President, I do want to thank this Medford City Council that took the time, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5856.095s">when</a> it didn't look that anything was going to result in this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5861.7s">And</a> I think we're that much closer to coming to a win-win situation on both sides, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5868.886s">And</a> I want to thank the members of this council that stood up to say, you know what, we'd like to go on a site visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5874.971s">We'd</a> like to hear from the property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5877.981s">We'd</a> like to come to a resolve, because we all support the same issues behind this rail, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5884.704s">Don't</a> let anyone kid you otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5887.064s">We</a> all support it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5889.285s">And</a> it was because of the due diligence of this council standing up and saying that we believe we can make a difference, that I hope this comes to fruition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5900.469s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6469.534s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6470.555s">And</a> I appreciate both sides on this, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6473.335s">But</a> after last night's meeting, I think we'd be doing this whole process an injustice to keep on moving the goal pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6482.557s">If</a> we keep on moving it, we got a commitment last night to move forward based on what was stated last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6489.949s">And</a> that was clear to me, what was stated last night, that we were going to work to maintain the front facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6497.037s">And</a> we were not going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6498.858s">This</a> is right out of Ryan Hayward's mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6501.379s">And</a> I think I asked him the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6503.14s">And</a> he said, absolutely, we would wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6505.14s">He</a> said, we may do it at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6506.821s">I</a> remember him saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6508.682s">We</a> may do it down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6510.563s">I</a> can't promise you we won't revisit it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6512.683s">But</a> at this point, if we're able to move this forward, like we did last night, that we weren't going to move that issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6519.526s">So</a> now we're hearing that you want to move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6521.627s">Because</a> even though it's the first reading, it's still moving the issue forward, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6526.529s">However</a> you slice that pie, it's still moving it forward, and that flies in the face of what we agreed upon in good faith last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6534.332s">So</a> I don't think we can keep on moving the goal post here and think we're going to come out with a resolve if we're going to change the game as this goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6542.874s">That's</a> all I say, and I don't think that represents either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6546.615s">I</a> think that's just common sense in negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6550.177s">If</a> you don't stick by a negotiation, it's not going to end up working.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6556.079s">I'm</a> not saying it has anything to do with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6558.96s">But</a> what I'm saying is I don't think we should change it at this particular point.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7221.736s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Knight, for his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7228.121s">This</a> indeed is a very difficult time to move forward on such a large endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7235.307s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7237.077s">It</a> was back in February of 2016 when I offered the original home rule petition, which I believe some members of the council were on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7247.405s">It</a> reads a little different from what the mayor is offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7251.108s">At</a> the time, we were looking at a seven member commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7257.013s">We</a> also outlined when a final report would be back with recommendations, which at the time we thought was <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7265.72s">key</a> component to moving this along, because if you leave it open ended, the process inherently is a long process to start off with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7275.924s">When</a> we reviewed this back in 2016, February 2016, we were looking at potential ballot questions in 2019 or 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7289.636s">So</a> that shows you it's at least a two to three year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7295.581s">Built</a> into that number is at the time what we established was an 18 month review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7304.409s">So</a> once you establish a commission, then they had roughly 18 months to go through a charter that hasn't been reviewed in 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7315.413s">A</a> charter that's only been changed over the last 34 years, ironically, to give increases to the mayor's salary, which is under the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7327.083s">And</a> that's the only really review that's been looked at when it comes to charter review in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7334.37s">The</a> charter is the constitution that governs our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7338.734s">It's</a> a vital document that I'd say most people in the community are unaware of because, let's be quite frank, we haven't reviewed it in 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7347.864s">There</a> hasn't been much discussion and people are just not aware of what the charter defines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7354.791s">And</a> there's a number of issues within the charter or responsibilities and powers that define how government operates, the length of terms, the duties and powers and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7369.918s">And</a> it is extremely vital, even during a pandemic, that we focus on a charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7378.923s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, think there's no better time than the present <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7384.369s">to</a> start the ball rolling and take a look at what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7390.892s">And</a> this is not putting a stamp of approval saying that things will be changed in the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7397.055s">We're</a> asking for a charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7399.857s">The</a> commission may sit down and look at the charter and say, wow, you guys created a perfect charter 34 years ago, and we don't think anything needs to be done to this charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7410.182s">I</a> don't think that's going to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7412.756s">But</a> that could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7414.717s">So</a> this is not saying the charter's going to be changed in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7418.278s">It's</a> just saying, let's create a review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7421.879s">Many</a> charters that, if you look at cities and towns, they have a built-in periodic review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7430.743s">When</a> ours was created some 34 years ago, there was no built-in review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7436.045s">Hence</a> why we're at a point now that the charter's never been reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7441.963s">So</a> when I offered the resolution back in 2016, the home rule petition, one of the recommendations that was part of that petition was that at a minimum, an amendment be present in the city charter instituting an appointed committee to conduct a periodic review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7464.335s">So</a> at a minimum, whatever happened, if there were no change at all, then at least we know going forward, and I agree with this 1,000%, I don't know where my colleagues stand, that this charter should be reviewed every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7476.863s">Whether</a> it's yearly, whether it's every few years, whatever it might be, it needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7482.586s">If</a> you had a business plan from 35 years ago, you would be out of business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7487.651s">And</a> the charter is no different, it's a business plan how we operate a community and how we run a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7494.953s">And</a> so I think it's very important that we move forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7499.654s">If</a> it does calling for a refiling next year, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7504.875s">So</a> be it, we refile it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7507.036s">When</a> we filed this back in 2016, it was a four to three vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7513.408s">It</a> passed four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7516.309s">We</a> sent it to the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7518.729s">Many</a> of us that were supportive of this back in 2016 followed through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7525.451s">Unfortunately,</a> the process did not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7528.872s">The</a> chairman of the committee, and his name escapes me right now, decided on his own, Mr. President, because I talked to him back in 2016, decided on his own not to give this a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7544.332s">And</a> I asked, why would you not give a petition that's before you, a home rule petition that's crafted by a city saying the city wants it, the representatives, the forefathers of the city said, we want this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7557.372s">And</a> his answer to me, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7560.819s">was</a> that I don't believe that the four to three vote was a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7567.968s">It</a> didn't represent a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7571.833s">And</a> I question saying a four to three vote is a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7576.559s">And</a> it's no difference when you vote as a state legislator that a majority wins, a majority rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7583.281s">And</a> at the time, he just disagreed and didn't give it the proper hearing that it should have received, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7589.804s">So</a> I'm hoping this time, and I know there's some members that are hesitant with this, Mr. President, but I would respectfully ask my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7598.547s">that</a> allow this to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7601.591s">This</a> is the first step in many steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7605.156s">This</a> is a two to three year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7608.38s">This</a> is not going to happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7610.382s">And</a> I'm hoping as we move forward, Mr. President, that the pandemic will be behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7615.984s">That's</a> how long this process is going to take, and I'm hoping that's behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7620.308s">So</a> regarding the signatures that are required, I believe it's 15% of the number of registered voters that you have in the community to put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7636.069s">We've</a> had people of the community for the last several years, some good people that have walked around, knocked doors, stood in front of stores, got thousands of signatures, still fell short of the mark of the 15% that's required, Mr. President, but did yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7654.673s">And</a> I believe there's enough support out there in the community to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7659.194s">Why</a> not assist, if we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7661.895s">As</a> legislators for this city, why not assist in moving the process forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7670.503s">Not</a> disregarding a process, the signatures is one process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7674.086s">A</a> home rule petition is another process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7677.469s">There's</a> more ways than one to skin a cat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7680.532s">We're</a> skinning a cat a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7682.734s">We're</a> going to the legislative home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7686.721s">It's</a> long overdue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7688.823s">I</a> appreciate there's a lot of opinions on this, and it hasn't been looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7692.966s">And</a> some people may see this as a struggle for power, some people may see it all different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7700.292s">I</a> see it, Mr. President, as good government in reviewing a document that really requires review in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7708.258s">The</a> city has changed in the last 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7712.526s">And</a> we should change with the times as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7715.189s">So</a> I respectfully ask my colleagues to take a long look at this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7720.334s">I</a> will be supporting this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7723.217s">Like</a> I said, to move the first step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7725.74s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7919.435s">Councilor</a> Marks, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7921.937s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I don't like to dwell on the past, but knowing what happened in 2016, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7929.195s">And</a> I'm not sure if that representative is still even the chairman of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7932.899s">I</a> don't know if it was the committee on local affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7936.183s">I</a> can't even remember the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7939.727s">Maybe</a> election laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7941.349s">John</a> Rogers, is that something? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7942.97s">Maybe</a> it was Representative Rogers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7946.674s">I</a> can't recall, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7948.476s">I</a> got a lot of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7950.126s">Useful</a> information stuck in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7953.928s">Useless</a> information stuck in my head, but that's not one of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7956.89s">But</a> I would just ask, Mr. President, respectfully that I would hate to pass something that is going to be on the same wave as we did in 2016 and then only go up to the State House and them say that it doesn't have the support of the city because of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7978.204s">or</a> the sheer number of votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7981.127s">So</a> I can see what my colleagues are stating, that this may not be the best time, but if we looked at maybe the beginning of the next fiscal year, January, does that sound like a time that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7998.373s">would</a> be amendable to other members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8000.634s">I</a> don't know if it's strictly just the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8002.555s">They</a> may have other philosophical differences with charter review and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8007.418s">But</a> if that's the case, I wouldn't mind holding off until January, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8013.701s">Especially</a> if this did happen to go down tonight, we couldn't bring it up again for what, 90 days? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8020.098s">So</a> you're looking at that time frame anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8023.86s">I'm</a> prepared to vote on it tonight, but I just would hate to see this go down the same way, because I really believe in it strongly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8031.905s">So</a> I just want to throw that out to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8034.367s">If</a> there is support, maybe not this particular second, but maybe in January, is that workable? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8042.772s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8043.632s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Scarpelli.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8336.544s">Councilman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8337.365s">I</a> just want to clarify that the gentleman said regarding what representation and how we elect the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8343.528s">There's</a> also an elected board called the school committee, and they are elected the same way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8347.931s">So</a> I think when we talk about charter review, we have to be careful not to just isolate certain groups, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8355.836s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8356.236s">You</a> are correct, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8358.337s">Matt,</a> please continue.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8536.446s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9117.755s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and the letter we received from the Community Development Board with their recommendation, I thought was already part of our brewery ordinance when we talked about the serving of food <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9134.421s">And</a> the ability to produce on site or bring in food from off site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9140.743s">And</a> also have food trucks on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9144.764s">I</a> thought that was language we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9146.545s">If</a> it's not in there for some reason, I know this went back and forth with attorneys and <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9151.406s">Back</a> and forth with the council, I strongly support adding the language that was recommended by the Community Development Board after the definition of brewery that states the facility may also provide food that is produced on site, produced off site, or produced with food trucks that are located on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9172.159s">So</a> I would ask that that be part of the ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9175.542s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9337.637s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9341.298s">So</a> we do have an established look at commission, and I would think they would be the appropriate body to- Right, right, right, to be the enforcement authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9352.922s">But</a> I agree, and we have a fishing industry, and you can only catch a certain number of fish. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9360.584s">We</a> don't have state or federal officials on the boats. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9364.166s">They</a> have a quota that they're allowed to get, and it's on an honor system, and they keep track of it and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9369.709s">And</a> I would see this as no difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9371.69s">If</a> there is a limitation on what can be produced or the size or whatever it is, that would be the case in this as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9381.135s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9532.079s">Include</a> the language from the CD board as recommended.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9554.098s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9777.244s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9778.304s">I'd</a> be remiss if I did not thank the subcommittee for their work on this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9785.089s">This</a> was countless meetings over a long period of time, and a lot of time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9793.374s">went</a> into this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9795.337s">I</a> realize that many other communities have come out with their ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9801.345s">But</a> let me tell you, this was crafted in a way that I feel comfortable and residents of this community should feel comfortable that there are many safeguards in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9810.798s">in</a> this ordinance, Mr. President, that protects neighborhoods, protects residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9816.66s">It</a> was a thoughtful ordinance that was put together, and I want to thank Chairman Knight and Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello for their countless hours on putting this together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9830.324s">This</a> doesn't happen by chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9832.685s">This</a> happens by work, and I appreciate my colleagues' work on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10690.882s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10692.343s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10693.283s">I</a> want to thank my council colleague for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10696.444s">I</a> just want to make sure we have the correct terminology because I'm not sure if that system tracks items that are resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10707.774s">It</a> may or may not, I think it will state whether they're closed or not, which doesn't necessarily reflect whether they're resolved or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10716.639s">So</a> maybe Jackie can expound on that, but I want to make sure if we're comparing apples to apples that, because I think it is a vital tool, as Councilor Knight mentioned, that this C-Click fix should be used during a budgetary process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10732.168s">So</a> we can see the number one request and see what's happening in the community and use that as a budget tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10738.709s">So</a> I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10740.13s">I</a> just want to make sure we're able to extract what we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10744.931s">So</a> maybe it would be helpful to find out what the terminology is.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10866.693s">Thoughts</a> on the marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10868.454s">So</a> just to follow up, Jackie, what are the reported items that you can currently draw from now?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10938.066s">So</a> just if I could, I don't want to belabor the point, but maybe if I pose it a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10943.147s">Currently</a> right now, are you able to see within C-Click Fix, as Councilor Knight mentioned in his report, are you able to see if things are resolved? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10953.17s">Or</a> if they're just closed out?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11569.142s">Maybe</a> if we can get an update from the city administration, I thought they did hire an assistant city treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11577.844s">I</a> thought that position was filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11579.844s">But</a> if we can get an update on that, there's been some transition in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11583.505s">And</a> to be quite frank, we haven't received any correspondence on things that are going on within the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11589.686s">There's</a> been people that have left positions and we haven't received any formal communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11596.906s">We</a> can ask, Jackie should know that, but I thought they did bring on an assistant treasurer collector.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11627.588s">What</a> about regarding the assistant treasurer-collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11631.189s">Has</a> that position been filled?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11649.976s">Mr.</a> President, if I could? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11651.417s">Yes,</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11653.311s">That</a> particular office, in my opinion, is in good hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11659.796s">We</a> have an acting treasurer-collector who was the former treasurer-collector for many, many years in this community and ran that office with the utmost respect and confidence and accounting methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11677.229s">And</a> I'm not sure what <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11680.632s">The</a> need is to have a city auditor audit the treasurer collector's office, unless there's an issue of concern, because there is a yearly audit that does take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11692.027s">And</a> maybe we should be asking what the results were of the previous audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11697.194s">But</a> I'm not sure what this would, we have a great staff down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11702.1s">They</a> work very hard, and I'm not quite sure what this would accomplish, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11709.709s">So</a> I will not be supporting this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11711.571s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11918.227s">So</a> it's my understanding the independent audit that we hired, independent outside audit, comes in and audits City Hall yearly, so once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11929.552s">So</a> that would be an independent audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11931.832s">The</a> auditor from the city does a monthly audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11936.997s">So</a> I just want to make sure whatever we're requesting is what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11940.739s">Do</a> we want the independent audit that's done on a yearly basis, three years worth of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11945.982s">Or</a> do we want to look at three years worth of a monthly audit that's done internally? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11951.685s">So</a> I just want to make sure we're on the same page.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11961.764s">From</a> the independent audit? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11963.404s">The</a> independent audit, not the internal audit, yeah.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12025.796s">Your</a> microphone is now on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12027.878s">And</a> we all received an email, I think it was about a week, week and a half ago, from a resident that was very concerned about his automobile excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12038.848s">And</a> he stated at the time that he usually gets a bill in the mail for his auto excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12044.754s">This</a> year he did not get the bill in the mail for his excise tax and therefore forgot to pay it and he got a surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12052.799s">In</a> addition to that surcharge, his wife, who the city goes into her account and automatically withdraws the excise, didn't go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12062.91s">Supposedly,</a> according to this resident, didn't go in and withdraw the amount for the excise tax from her account and it went in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12075.442s">they</a> again charged a surcharge that wasn't her fault because the city was supposed to go in and remove the amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12082.467s">I</a> think I'm explaining the email correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12085.028s">So</a> I think some of that issue, Mr. President, I'm hoping maybe we can resolve by asking maybe the acting treasurer collector regarding that particular incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12098.199s">And</a> if that's, because the email we got made it sound like it was a systemic problem throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12105.523s">And</a> this was happening to lots of people throughout the community, and not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12111.607s">So</a> I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12113.429s">Maybe</a> as part of this paper, if Councilor Knight doesn't mind, we can ask that question directly to the Treasurer-Collector's Office.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12121.874s">Okay,</a> so that's an amendment from Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12133.399s">That</a> the treasurer collect a report back to the Medford City Council regarding a concern of excise tax in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12144.548s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12145.329s">And</a> then I can elaborate more on, that's the general gist.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12421.069s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12422.45s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12424.311s">Thank</a> you, and I want to thank my colleagues, Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight, for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12430.534s">You</a> couldn't ask for a better person. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12432.695s">I</a> grew up with Rich Razzo in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12435.676s">We</a> were very close friends for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12438.318s">And</a> he is a great business owner, a great family man, a great son, and just a good friend, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12446.782s">And</a> he runs his business the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12450.083s">It's</a> like going to Cheers when you go into Razzles. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12453.565s">You</a> know everyone, he employs a lot of local kids from this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12460.489s">He</a> assists, as my council colleagues mentioned, on a number of activities that go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12466.752s">He's</a> the first to donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12468.353s">If</a> you ever look at donation list, Razzles is always on there giving of not only his food and his expertise, but his time as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12479.378s">I</a> wish him well, and as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I wish him another 15 years, at the very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12486.626s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12672.01s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12673.17s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12679.213s">Teresa</a> was a true Methodite. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12684.895s">As</a> was mentioned, John was a staple and a household name, her husband for many years in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12692.038s">And</a> she was always the foundation of that relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12696.26s">And</a> I just want to thank her for her many years of committed service to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12703.404s">She</a> was a terrific mother, wife, grandmother, and she will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12710.287s">And</a> if my colleague wouldn't mind, I think it's only appropriate that we dedicate this meeting in Teresa Galoni's name.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13474.414s">Mr.</a> President, this was an issue that the council spoke about several weeks back regarding the need for additional assistance within the registrar voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13486.64s">I</a> have yet to see a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13489.982s">that</a> addresses the council concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13492.944s">And</a> this is not just the council concern, this is concern of many, many residents, if not thousands of residents, Mr. President, that just went through a primary election and some of the concerns that were associated with a new COVID type system. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13513.458s">with</a> mail-in ballots and so forth of the likes that we've never seen in this community before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13519.143s">The</a> reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, is that we have an election, a very important election coming up in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13526.789s">We</a> have a presidential election coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13529.952s">And</a> it's vital as a community that we have the resources to handle the election, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13539.299s">Interesting</a> fact that I just found out, since 2010, in this community, the number of voters went up by 55% compared to 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13553.824s">I've</a> been telling people over the last several years, when they ask me how many voters we have in the community, I was rattling out a figure that I recall it was about 35,000 registered voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13568.658s">Unbeknownst,</a> Mr. President, we're up over 40,000 registered voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13575.583s">So</a> I was about 5,000 voters off from the last figure I had, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13581.787s">This</a> is only to show that the number of voters in this community has increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13587.73s">The</a> capacity in that office has not increased over the years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13593.454s">And</a> it's about time that we hire someone to assist the city clerk who wears many hats in his role. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13602.178s">And</a> it's about time that we hire an election coordinator, someone that can go into the office, Mr. President, and run the registrar of voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13613.764s">Now</a> election coordinator would not be just a figurehead. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13618.166s">An</a> election coordinator would address personnel needs, address issues of concern at all the polling locations, especially in a time of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13629.614s">We're</a> talking about increased safety for polling workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13633.076s">We're</a> talking about plexiglass. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13634.657s">We're</a> talking about masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13636.058s">We're</a> talking about sanitizing after someone goes into a polling booth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13639.821s">There's</a> a lot more responsibility and things associated in this new COVID era that we're experiencing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13649.167s">The</a> election coordinator would also be involved with the training of wardens, clerks, and inspectors for the elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13659.533s">The</a> election coordinator would be responsible for the maintaining and date working knowledge of <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13666.938s">election</a> law as set forth by the Secretary of State's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13670.941s">They</a> would oversee the distribution of the absentee and no excuse mail-in ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13676.604s">They</a> would follow and maintain all mandated deadlines, create all tally sheets for the clerk's folio, audit the folio at the close of the polls, ensure calculations are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13689.432s">Set</a> up and maintain all tasks, including staff, instruction, training, poll pads, working with DPW for the setup of the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13698.139s">Process</a> on a daily basis all ballots cast during early voting through the VRIS state system. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13706.505s">Organize</a> early tabulation and central tabulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13709.468s">Create</a> spreadsheets and certification tabulation of elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13715.904s">You</a> could see the importance, Mr. President, of having someone that would oversee this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13722.148s">And</a> I think asking the city clerk, who already has a full plate, just from being city clerk and dealing with the council, to then also say, you're also in charge every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13734.237s">This</a> is not every couple of years, every other year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13737.139s">Every</a> year to run a major election in a city of our size, Mr. President, I think is asking for too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13744.364s">Most</a> surrounding communities have an election coordinator, they have someone that's in charge of the election process, and it is not the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13754.406s">It</a> is an additional role. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13756.407s">And</a> I would ask Mr. President, in the interest of maintaining what I would say is fair elections in this community, maintaining a system that I think we all feel comfortable knowing that our system is a good system in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13771.69s">Does</a> it need improvements? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13772.91s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13773.771s">Does</a> it require additional staff like a coordinator? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13777.492s">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13779.052s">And</a> we want to maintain the integrity of what we have, Mr. President, in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13784.514s">And</a> I think that will go a long way to ensuring residents that in this new day and age, with probably the expansion of moving forward with voting, early voting, and voting by mail and so forth, it's only going to expand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13801.059s">that</a> we really need to make sure we have a state-of-the-art register of voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13806.782s">We</a> have great workers in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13808.983s">We</a> have great women that have been in there for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13812.584s">They</a> do terrific work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13814.965s">But</a> I think it's time, Mr. President, that we connect everything together now and really go into the 21st century and provide the tools that we need for that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13825.19s">So</a> again, I ask that the administration, Mr. President, because this was sent to the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13831.069s">The</a> administration reflect upon this and the integrity of our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13836.353s">And</a> we have previous experience from the primary of what can potentially go wrong in an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13845.62s">And</a> the fact that we need this assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13847.961s">This</a> is not City Councilor Michael Mark saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13850.743s">This</a> is residents throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13852.985s">This</a> is the city clerk himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13855.407s">And</a> I think it's about time that we get a commitment from this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13861.263s">Mr.</a> President, to put this position in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13864.287s">Whatever</a> it takes to fund it, let's do it, let's move forward, and let's make sure we maintain the integrity of our electoral process in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13874.382s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13874.843s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13876.585s">Vice</a> President Caraviello.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14286.926s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14288.466s">And</a> even though it's late at night, I have the energy to be angry about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14294.387s">Let</a> me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14297.675s">It</a> was great on September 10th, Mr. President, when I put on the local news and I saw the governor, the lieutenant governor, Secretary of Transportation Pollack, all in Bistro 5 in West Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14314.682s">The</a> governor was there to talk about his daily or weekly COVID report. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14320.441s">And</a> then they also found time, Mr. President, to discuss the outdoor dining, which I support 1,000%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14329.771s">And</a> also as part of this, Mr. President, Secretary Pollack <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14335.416s">mentioned</a> about several projects that are going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14341.18s">One</a> being complete streets, how we've received money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14345.243s">And</a> I am thankful for the money, I'm thankful for the projects that have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14350.347s">The</a> other is the recent money we received from MassDOT regarding the shared streets and spaces grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14358.593s">And</a> that is partly the reason why they were there to show how we're able now to do some outdoor dining and take some of the money to do heating ramps and cement barriers and anything else that would assist local entrepreneurs in the community to have additional seating during this COVID, which I support a thousand percent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14385.451s">The</a> one issue I do have, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14388.752s">The</a> one issue I think everyone behind this real should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14392.494s">And</a> if we had a real media in this community, there was a lot of media there, Mr. President, but they weren't locals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14402.74s">The</a> questions asked weren't locals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14405.722s">If</a> they invited the rest of us, and if the rest of us were able to get into that, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14412.051s">meeting</a> as my colleague experienced for himself that attended and wasn't one of the lucky people to be able to attend the meeting and maybe ask a question or partake in the conference that was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14427.469s">But</a> Mr. President, what has this council and the residents of this community have talked about and requested from MassDOT, Secretary of Transportation Pollack, for the last 20 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14440.518s">Although</a> she hasn't been the secretary for that long, but she's been there for several years under this current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14448.264s">One</a> of the top three most dangerous intersections in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14457.233s">The</a> corner of South Street and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14460.775s">It's</a> been a bone of contention since I've been on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14466.438s">And</a> here we have the Secretary of Transportation coming in and touting complete streets and mass DOT shared streets, which are great programs, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14479.687s">But</a> no mention of a major issue, we've sent countless resolutions from this council to DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14487.871s">We've</a> sent it to the mayor, we've sent it to our state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14491.153s">Councilor</a> Scapelli has had countless meetings on this, requesting that signalization be placed at that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14499.538s">That</a> some low lying fruit be done, signage, painting of crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14507.975s">winding</a> of curbs and sidewalks, traffic calming initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14515.677s">And</a> to have the audacity, Mr. President, or maybe this doesn't make it to the secretary's desk when we request things as a city council on behalf of 60,000 people, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14529.399s">But</a> I would think an issue of that importance should have been part of the discussion, whether it was during the press conference, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14538.038s">before</a> the press conference, on the sidewalk, after the press conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14543.062s">But</a> at some point, Mr. President, I would hope that this discussion around a two-decade-old public safety concern in this community needed to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14559.906s">And</a> I can guarantee you it wasn't mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14563.028s">It</a> didn't make the list, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14564.989s">They</a> were just here to tell what they want to tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14570.293s">And</a> not address the issues that we're talking about as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14577.277s">And</a> South Street's just one, but it's a major one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14583.461s">So</a> as far as I'm concerned, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14586.095s">Next</a> time we invite Secretary of Transportation Paul to the city of Medford, she should come bearing several million dollars to do the signalization we need from Salem Street to Potter High Street to Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14605.168s">To</a> finish off that corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14606.909s">That</a> is not, that part of South and Main is not city property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14611.993s">If</a> it was, I'd be barking at the administration, I'd be barking at our traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14617.817s">We're</a> building a brand new police station across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14622.441s">And</a> you have to risk your life to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14627.004s">It</a> really is a disgrace, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14631.035s">And</a> it bothered me to see Secretary Pollack sit back and take kudos for some other projects that are warranted, and I support Mr. President, but to not address the 1,000 pound gorilla in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14649.43s">And</a> if she wasn't advised of the letters we've been sending over the past 20 years, shame on her staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14656.936s">And</a> shame on who's in charge there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14660.987s">I'd</a> like to send a letter, Mr. President, from this council, and I hope the council will support it, to Secretary Pollack, thanking her for coming to the city of Medford on September 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14673.718s">And</a> thanking her for her work on complete streets and the shared streets and spaces grant program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14682.064s">However,</a> Mr. President, I want to know what's happening at the corner of South and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14691.65s">And</a> I want to know why we haven't received a thorough response from the Department of Transportation that addresses the public safety concerns of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14701.536s">You</a> know how many accidents have been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14703.237s">I</a> brought this up about six, seven, eight weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14706.078s">I</a> got the statistics from the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14708.7s">And</a> when I say in the top three accident related and most dangerous intersections, I didn't create that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14714.223s">That</a> was from his data that he presented to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14718.045s">That</a> was directly from his data. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14720.998s">So</a> this is not a pie in the sky or a wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14724.359s">This</a> is a public safety concern, and we've all addressed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14728.481s">We've</a> all addressed it a million times, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14730.742s">So</a> I respectfully request that the city clerk draft a letter on behalf of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14739.437s">requesting</a> that Secretary Pollack address, once again, the request of this council about what are they going to do regarding the intersection, the state road, the intersection of South and Main Street, in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14758.108s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14851.243s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14852.104s">I</a> was approached by a number of residents in the city of Medford that had concern regarding state regulated and licensed halfway homes within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14862.757s">I</a> did a little additional research and some past history I have working <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14870.667s">with</a> residents regarding a previous halfway house that existed in the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14876.973s">I</a> found some information that I think people would be surprised about when the state regulates and licenses halfway homes within the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14888.023s">There</a> is zero notification to cities and towns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14894.206s">There</a> are zero regulations on our books regarding halfway homes within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14902.072s">There</a> are zero zoning ordinances regarding halfway houses in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14908.277s">And</a> I put this forward, Mr. President, as chapter 111B of the Mass General Law section 6A that the Board of Health regulates halfway homes within the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14920.667s">And</a> I put it on that we have a round table discussion with Chief Buckley, with our state delegation, our building commissioner, our city solicitor, to make sure, Mr. President, that we have rules and regulations within our community, Mr. President, that safeguard our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14944.671s">And</a> there was an unfortunate incident that took place a few weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14949.392s">Thank</a> God a resident came out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14954.493s">All</a> right, Mr. President, but it could have went very different, very, very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14960.434s">And</a> there was some concern regarding this particular incident and that this particular issue of halfway homes within our community needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14975.213s">I'm</a> not saying we have to eliminate, which I don't believe we can, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14979.995s">But</a> I believe, as Councilman Knight mentioned, knowledge is power. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14984.737s">And</a> I think that we should have the knowledge when a halfway home is licensed in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14993.271s">And</a> that at the very least, we should be on notice, Mr. President, on how we should protect residents that may be living within proximity of these particular homes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15009.731s">I</a> offer that in a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15011.133s">I</a> would ask, I know you have a million things as committee of the whole, Mr. President, but I would ask at some point we create a committee of the whole meeting to address this very important issue on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15026.633s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15722.317s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15727.859s">Uh,</a> I didn't hear anyone say about keeping anyone out of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15732.121s">So,</a> you know, if we're going to state things, Mr. President, we should accurately reflect what was stated and no one once said to keep anyone out of this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15752.881s">Says</a> who?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15858.744s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15946.903s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16225.637s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_ODT3XVbBhL4/2024-11-19_ODT3XVbBhL4.html">City Council 09-08-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1105.334s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I thank the superintendent for being on the call tonight and the administrative staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1112.777s">The</a> email we received today talks about WB engineering report and that the amount to look at ventilation air quality, air exchange would significantly exceed $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1125.921s">I</a> was just wondering, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1133.18s">regarding</a> the 200,000, is that particularly to the high school or is that in general across the board?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1174.059s">Okay,</a> so Madam Superintendent, you mentioned the roof fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1179.903s">At</a> Medford High School, I guess roughly 100 roof fans at an estimated cost of $125,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1185.247s">Is</a> that part of this $200,000 that's listed as WB engineering report?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1259.29s">My</a> question is regarding the $200,000 that was mentioned within the email we got today and also a previous email we received from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1269.616s">It</a> mentioned that each classroom needed these filters at $1,500 a piece, but it didn't mention how many classrooms and if it was just the high school or if it was classrooms across the entire city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1448.968s">So</a> through you, Mr. President, when was the WB engineering study commissioned by the school department and voted on by the school committee?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1473.631s">Is</a> there a particular reason why the school district waited so long to commission an air quality study?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1525.065s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1525.505s">And</a> when did we find out there's hot evidence now that says the quality of air is fine?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1544.756s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1545.416s">Right,</a> so I'm just wondering why for the past six months, the school administration, knowing that eventually we're going to have faculty, students, staff back within our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1559.191s">Over</a> the last six months, didn't realize that a first step would have been to do an air quality test within the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1568.04s">And</a> I'm not sure why it took so long to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1571.682s">But</a> putting that aside, Mr. President, this was tabled two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1578.866s">And</a> one of the motions made by the council was to ask the administration and the school committee for a list of their priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1589.612s">Because</a> at the time we heard of a number of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1593.873s">One</a> being ventilation, air quality, air exchange in order to provide a healthy and safe building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1600.195s">But</a> we also heard about handicapped ramps accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1605.257s">We</a> also heard about the condition of our restrooms within the school department and a number of other concerns as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1614.28s">We</a> just recently received an email from the mayor stating that if we could release the funds, they're also looking to use some of the funds for beautification purposes in the main entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1629.303s">which</a> I know firsthand that that is something that's needed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1635.651s">I</a> was part of the crew that painted that several months back under the leadership of Bill Carr Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1641.218s">and</a> a number of volunteers, so I know that's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1644.923s">But</a> I believe, and I can't speak for my colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1648.227s">Why</a> we asked for a priority list was to make sure that we had a reasonable assessment, Mr. President, on what are we going to do to get our children, and our teachers, and our faculty, and our staff back into a safe building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1663.497s">And</a> to me, beautification of a front entrance is probably at the bottom of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1668.86s">And</a> air quality, and air exchange, and ventilation, and other priorities, Mr. President, would be at the top of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1676.185s">And</a> that's what I was hoping to receive from the administration and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1680.987s">And</a> to be quite frank, I am very disappointed that we didn't even get a response, Mr. President, from the council motion that was two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1689.832s">That</a> was from August 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1693.173s">Unless</a> I'm mistaken, I have yet to receive anything, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1697.716s">That's</a> not to say that I realize that work needs to be done in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1703.4s">But</a> it would be helpful, Mr. President, if we're going to work in cooperation with the school side, that if we have requests, that they recognize and honor our request, Mr. President, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1717.87s">I</a> have no problem allotting money, Mr. President, but I'd like to know what it's going to go towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1724.356s">Now,</a> if we free up $800,000 tonight to go into this fund, there's no saying that they won't end up doing beautification over ventilation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1736.93s">I</a> would hope that's not the case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1739.851s">And</a> clearly, if there are 100 fans that are currently not working on the roof, you can almost bet your bottom dollar the air quality and circulation in that building is not good, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1752.495s">So</a> this is not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1754.676s">They're</a> already coming out saying they have to <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1757.957s">can't</a> change out all the filters, the fans on the roof aren't working, over 100 fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1764.319s">That's</a> what circulates air within a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1766.679s">That's</a> what provides proper air quality and air exchange and ventilation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1772.581s">So</a> those are the concerns I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1775.762s">And</a> maybe if the superintendent or someone else from the administration can assure us that if we do release money tonight, that the priority is to get people back into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1787.927s">And</a> to make sure that the air quality and the safety of our students, and our teachers, and our staff, and our faculty is the number one priority, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1798.231s">And</a> then we can look at other needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1800.592s">My</a> other point, Mr. President, is two weeks ago, Aleesha Nunley represented to us when we took the vote that there was other money available. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1809.516s">I</a> believe I asked the question, because it was led to believe that if we didn't vote two weeks ago, that we were stalling students from getting back into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1820.4s">And</a> I asked Aleesha Nunley that question, and she said, there are CARES Act money available, and there's COVID-19 funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1828.183s">that</a> are available to work with the air quality and safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1834.889s">So</a> that's why I voted the way I did, Mr. President, knowing that there's other additional funds out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1840.694s">And</a> that the fact that I want to make sure as one member that if we're going to allot money, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1847.138s">that</a> it go into the safety of our faculty, students, and kids, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1852.282s">And</a> I'm sure the school committee and the administration share the concerns, but if we're going to be responsible for allocating this money, like every other paper, Mr. President, it'd be nice to have a paper in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1867.07s">And</a> I received an email today that I just happened to be able to take a look at just briefly, but I still haven't seen anything that prioritizes work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1877.896s">And</a> I realize the testing is still underway and current, but that's why I felt that if this happened two, three, four months ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1891.36s">Don't</a> forget the money that was in this account from the science labs, the 700,000, that's been sitting in the account for five years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1901.546s">Think</a> about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1902.606s">We</a> could have moved that money in for restrooms in the high school for the past five years, for working water bubblers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1910.091s">You</a> name it, Mr. President, what's needed in that high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1913.813s">So</a> this is money that could have been used over the past five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1919.096s">So</a> those are the concerns I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1922.358s">If</a> the superintendent can assure me tonight that this money will be prioritized for the reopening and the ventilation and air quality and air exchange and safety concerns over aesthetics and beautification at this particular stage, I will give it a vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1940.531s">If</a> not, Mr. President, I will not move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1943.714s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=3963.736s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=3964.797s">I</a> was wondering if we, I asked the question earlier, I'm not sure if I got an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=3969.178s">If</a> the school administration knows how much, or maybe Mr. Rodriguez, how much money is available in the CARES Act and also the COVID funds for safety purposes within our public schools?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4030.607s">And</a> Mr. President, I have a question for the superintendent of schools regarding what is the current school policy on the rental of our buildings?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4130.952s">So</a> Madam Superintendent, I am astonished. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4135.853s">We're</a> talking about safety and health of our students, our faculty, our teachers, staff within our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4144.716s">Why</a> we would introduce <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4147.601s">hundreds</a> of people that wouldn't necessarily be in our buildings into our buildings through the rental of our buildings.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4228.321s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I was just trying to finish my thought, and I appreciate the superintendent's response. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4234.967s">However,</a> Mr. President, when I say hundreds, I said hundreds, and it's really thousands because it's not the one Saturday or Sunday they're in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4244.694s">It's</a> over a course of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4246.476s">So</a> to sit back and say it's only a couple of hundred, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4249.798s">That</a> may be true for one given weekend, Mr. President, or two, but not over the course of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4255.283s">It's</a> thousands of people being introduced into our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4260.088s">And</a> why subject students, staff, Mr. President, to the additional people coming into the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4266.494s">And</a> I understand and appreciate there's protocols and procedures, and they have to get signed off from the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4273.12s">And</a> I can appreciate that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4275.5s">But</a> in my opinion, when you have people from outside that are coming into the buildings, you're not sure what precautions they may be taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4283.442s">They</a> may sign a paper, Mr. President, but when they're in that building, what type of supervision is there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4289.443s">What</a> type of protocols are being put in place to make sure, Mr. President, that our kids, our staff, our teachers are being safe when they enter the building the next day? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4301.612s">Why</a> risk it, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4303.212s">They're</a> using our buildings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4305.653s">They're</a> using classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4307.713s">They're</a> using cafeterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4309.774s">They're</a> using gymnasiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4311.554s">They're</a> using restrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4313.154s">They're</a> using auditoriums. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4316.135s">Now,</a> you're telling me, Mr. President, that our staff, who are very capable at the high school, are going to make sure that every inch of the high school or the McGlynn School or any other school is sanitized, every inch of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4331.653s">I</a> have a tough time believing that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4334.754s">In</a> the interest of safety that we're talking about and health, I would respectfully ask that the school committee look back at their policy and stop the policy of renting the buildings, Mr. President, until we're able to get this situation under hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4351.358s">I</a> realize it's a revenue source for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4355.038s">I</a> understand that, Mr. President, that we count on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4358.959s">But</a> safety should come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4362.1s">I've</a> heard from a number of parents, a number of faculty members that are concerned about going back into the buildings because of the rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4370.814s">So</a> I would respectfully ask the superintendent and the school committee, along with the administration, revisit the policy on renting the buildings, Mr. President, until we can get a better handle on our children going back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4385.061s">The</a> issues that we're going to be confronting, not only with the rentals, Mr. President, but just going back to school in general under a COVID new society. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4394.765s">Why</a> compound it with the rentals of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4397.546s">It</a> makes zero sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4400.126s">And</a> no one's going to tell me otherwise, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4402.827s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4576.726s">Mr.</a> President, I would respectfully ask if the superintendent, I know she was trying to answer my questions and comments, if she can finish with her statement.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4690.593s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to go on record that I disagree 100% with the rental of our buildings during this particular phase of COVID-19 based on the health and safety of our students, our faculties, our administrators, our teachers, and everyone else within our buildings, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5080.097s">Council</a> Bears.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7498.665s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7502.288s">Those</a> who knew Ed knew he was a great person and good person to be around and he will sorely be missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7510.673s">I</a> also would like to mention we lost a resident just recently, Giovanni Puccio. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7518.457s">On</a> his recent passing, Mr. President, he was a tremendous father, husband, family man, and just a terrific guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7527.802s">And</a> he will be solely missed, Mr. President, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7530.724s">So</a> I'd ask if my council colleague wouldn't mind putting that on as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7534.446s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7924.375s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7925.636s">If</a> my council colleague wouldn't mind adding my paper on to this, paper 20-542, where they are similar in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7933.718s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7934.019s">Would</a> you like to make a motion to join the papers? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7936.379s">Please.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8155.819s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8156.7s">I</a> want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for putting this on the agenda as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8162.927s">For</a> the past several years, Mr. President, I've called for a public safety summit within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8168.974s">And</a> to date, I'm not proud to say that we have yet to have a public safety summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8174.06s">with</a> all the parties to be within this community to discuss these very issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8179.705s">And</a> Councilor Knight may not say it, but I am going to say it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8184.649s">Violent</a> crime is on the uptick in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8187.812s">And</a> you only have to read the paper, watch the local news, and talk to your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8193.077s">And</a> you'll hear what's happening in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8195.879s">From</a> home invasions, to car break-ins, to home break-ins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8200.243s">It's</a> happening all over the community, and I think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8205.028s">I</a> realize we do have a crime analyst in the community that's gathering crime data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8211.053s">But</a> the data is only as good, Mr. President, when it's being used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8217.119s">So</a> if it's not being used to update and provide the latest and greatest for our police department, then it's not good data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8226.424s">If</a> it's not used, Mr. President, to get the word out to the community, and that is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8231.947s">That</a> is key in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8233.548s">I've</a> talked to a lot of seniors in this community that are unaware, Mr. President, on what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8239.791s">And</a> I tell people constantly that may leave their front door open or their car unlocked to say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8246.535s">Those</a> days are behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8248.137s">I</a> hate to say it, they're behind us now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8250.158s">And</a> you should always proceed with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8253.141s">And</a> I believe you should be locking your front door, even during the day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8257.745s">I</a> believe you should be locking your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8259.647s">You</a> should be watching out for your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8261.549s">You</a> should leave a light on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8263.29s">that</a> may deter someone from robbing a house or a car or so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8268.235s">But</a> I think the announce of prevention goes a long way, the old saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8272.96s">And</a> we have to get word out to the community, not to alarm people, but to let them know what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8279.587s">To</a> let them know that they should take extra precaution, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8283.811s">And</a> I ask that our police department step up patrol around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8289.055s">I</a> ask that we do have this public safety summit to discuss some of the concerns we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8295.5s">Just</a> recently, Mr. President, and I won't get into the details, we had a home invasion that involved a 92-year-old woman that luckily, Mr. President, was able to escape. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8305.804s">because</a> God knows what would have resulted if she was not able to escape, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8311.346s">And</a> there's been some scuttlebutt around the community that this person may have been part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8316.628s">a</a> halfway house in the community, and living in our neighborhood, and living amongst us, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8323.572s">And</a> that raises some concern for residents, and rightfully so, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8328.755s">So</a> I think as a community, we have to take a step back and look at what's happening in our community, ways we can address issues, ways we can make our residents safer, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8339.381s">We</a> have a large percentage of seniors, and seniors are very vulnerable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8345.564s">So</a> that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8346.905s">I</a> would ask once again that we create a public safety summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8351.828s">I'm</a> not sure why it's impossible to get a public safety summit together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8357.191s">I</a> think I must have offered it three or four times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8360.713s">And</a> I've yet to get any buy-in from the former chief or this chief or anyone else, Mr. President, administration or anyone else to sit down and discuss these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8373.081s">Because</a> this is hitting home now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8374.983s">It's</a> not somewhere you're saying, well, this happens here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8378.185s">It's</a> happening in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8380.227s">It's</a> happening to our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8382.049s">And</a> it's concerning, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8383.67s">So</a> I just want to put that out there, that once again I ask for a public safety summit where we can sit down around the table and discuss some of the concerns we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8393.438s">If</a> it's funding, then as Councilor Knight mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8396.1s">then</a> the council should be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8397.922s">If</a> it's additional manpower, if it's additional tools that the police department needs to get the job done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8403.369s">If</a> it's additional outreach, community outreach, then so be it to make sure that residents are aware of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8410.757s">I've</a> asked in the past to use the reverse 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8414.101s">You</a> know, it's great to get when there's a road race in the city and you get a reverse 9-1-1, but 9-1-1 is for emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8421.61s">What</a> better emergency than if there are home invasions and people being attacked in our community, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8429.079s">You</a> know, and how blatant <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8431.842s">when</a> someone's sitting there and someone jumps through a picture window, a glass picture window, with the person sitting right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8440.228s">They</a> weren't trying to avoid detection. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8443.25s">They</a> weren't trying to avoid the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8446.743s">These</a> are very serious incidences, Mr. President, and they need to be discussed and addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8452.524s">And</a> I realize the police are probably working on their own, and things that they can't relay to the public, and I realize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8459.466s">But</a> I also believe the public should be well aware of what's going on, and we should be open and notorious when it comes to alerting residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8468.308s">And</a> I want to thank my colleague for putting this on.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9168.489s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9169.37s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Morell for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9173.134s">There's</a> a pattern here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9175.517s">Over</a> the last two years, mostly two years, the MBTA has tried to cut a number of bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9183.687s">over</a> and over again, Mr. President, and residents have to stand up and fight and contact the T and contact the state delegation and the mayor and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9192.809s">And</a> it's pretty disturbing that an MBTA, that their chief mission is to provide access of transportation, and they're constantly looking to cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9206.613s">transportation</a> in surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9209.955s">So</a> that's number one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9212.716s">For</a> full disclosure, I do, for the past four years, I've taken both the 325 and the 326. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9218.619s">So</a> some of this is from my own selfish standpoint, someone that takes that bus and has been on the bus with <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9227.403s">many,</a> many other people that rely on that bus for transportation to and from work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9233.988s">Councilor</a> Knight hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9235.91s">And</a> I've been talking about this literally for, I hate to say it, probably close to 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9244.217s">Let</a> me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9245.557s">The</a> MBTA has over $66 million in tax-exempt property in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9253.542s">Tax-exempt,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9255.904s">$66</a> million that they don't pay the city of Medford one nickel for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9260.686s">Their</a> assessment to us for providing T services as of 2017 was about $3.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9271.075s">So</a> that's what they charge us over and above when you pay a fare, when you get your T-card, when you pay 20% of the 5% sales tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9280.764s">That's</a> over and above we pay as a community, as Councilor Knight mentioned, for this particular service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9286.85s">So</a> when we have an express bus, we have additional routes, people say, wow, Method has great access. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9292.695s">We</a> pay for it, Mr. President, in many surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9297.342s">Winchester,</a> Arlington, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9300.723s">They</a> come to Method to jump on the express bus, or to get on the train in West Method, or to go to Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9308.607s">They</a> come into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9310.307s">We're</a> paying a heavy assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9312.428s">And</a> he's absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9313.509s">Back</a> some years ago, I offered a motion, which was passed and sent to our state delegation many years ago, that we offset the T assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9324.554s">based</a> on the tax-exempt property they have in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9329.08s">So</a> if it's 3.7 million that they come and take from us to operate services, they owe us 66 million for having tax exempt property in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9339.044s">So</a> that's how we offset it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9340.765s">Needless</a> to say, it never went anywhere in the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9344.006s">But</a> that's a whole other story for another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9347.208s">Method</a> has the sixth highest assessment out of the 175 communities that use the local assistance fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9355.031s">We</a> have the sixth highest assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9358.673s">So</a> when it's mentioned, like Councilman Wright mentioned that, you know what, if they're going to take service away, why wouldn't you cut the assessment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9367.981s">Why</a> wouldn't you cut that assessment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9370.383s">We're</a> paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9371.944s">It's</a> not something we're getting for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9373.505s">We're</a> paying for it through many different streams. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9378.338s">It</a> comes right off our charity sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9380.079s">So</a> whatever local aid we get from the state, they look at it and say, okay, you're going to get 15 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9386.901s">We're</a> taking 3.7 million from the T assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9390.962s">So</a> we're paying, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9394.303s">And</a> I think the T should answer to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9397.064s">They</a> really need to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9398.064s">So</a> I support what Councilor Knight offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9401.265s">I'd</a> also like to know, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9404.553s">How</a> are they going to start to pay us back for the $66 million in tax-exempt property they have in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9413.547s">Between</a> Wellington Station, the car bonds on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9420.627s">So</a> I appreciate my colleague putting this on there, and I'd like to hear back from the MBTA to find out exactly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9427.712s">If</a> this is a temporary cut or reduction in service, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9432.856s">That's</a> not the impression I'm getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9436.959s">Once</a> they make the cut, it's going to be very difficult to get it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9441.475s">You</a> remember the days, Mr. President, that we had a fight because there were so many people standing on the 325 and 326. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9448.679s">It</a> became a safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9450.881s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9451.881s">It</a> was over the capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9455.663s">And</a> we asked them to put on additional buses because the 325 and 326 couldn't accommodate the needs of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9467.044s">And</a> they never did so, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9468.444s">I</a> think they may have put on a route here and there, and then they ended up, yeah, I think they ended up putting one route on, and then they ended up canceling that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9476.987s">But</a> that shows you the need in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9479.248s">I</a> realize COVID has decreased the need, but it's gonna come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9483.249s">Everything's</a> gonna come back, and that's gonna come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9485.65s">And</a> I don't wanna be behind the eight ball, Mr. President, when residents are looking for the 325 and 326. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9491.752s">So</a> I would ask that you give us a commitment in the form of a motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9496.066s">That</a> this is just a temporary reduction in what their plans are for future service for the express bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9506.49s">They</a> want to keep people off the roads, they want to keep cars from going into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9510.312s">Why</a> would you eliminate express bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9513.513s">We</a> have an express lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9516.135s">What's</a> that used for if there's no express bus?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9521.477s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10236.146s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10237.187s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Biaz for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10242.21s">If</a> we recall when we were deliberating the budget, it was mentioned, I know I brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10248.015s">The</a> city clerk did request for an additional position within the registrar voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10255.82s">It</a> never found its way into the budget, but there was a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10261.022s">So</a> at the time, the city clerk realized that due to the upcoming election, the nature of the election, what's going to be requested of his office, the amount of votes that will be potentially early voting, mail-in and so forth, that it required someone from the Registrar of Voters Office to coordinate these efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10283.753s">which</a> currently doesn't exist right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10286.376s">As</a> my colleague mentioned, you have Mrs. Joyce, you have Mrs. Lamoni in there, you have Sandy that does a great job on, I believe, a part-time basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10295.667s">You</a> have a number of other staff people, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10298.63s">They</a> did the best they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10300.212s">But</a> clearly, the clerk who is also the chief election officer of the community felt fit that it would require additional personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10314.39s">And</a> I think the time to stand up was during the budget, now it's after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10319.156s">And</a> I think we're all looking back saying, in retrospect, we probably should have asked for that position, even though it wasn't part of the budget, but was requested as, if you want to call it a wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10331.366s">And</a> that would have been an important position, Mr. President, in my opinion, to make sure that our elections are on the up and up and the integrity of our elections, which should be of the utmost importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10346.999s">us</a> as elected officials and as a community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10351.102s">So</a> I just want to put that out there that I don't think it's too late now if we do need it, Mr. President, that we as a council can ask that the city administration, which I'm going to do in the form of a motion, that the city administration put into <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10372.096s">language</a> that would put forth the position of a coordinator in the registrar or voter's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10379.738s">And</a> I know the city clerk has the exact title and what the job description would be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10385.579s">And</a> I would ask that he supply that on this resolution back to the city administration because we know it's going to be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10393.762s">It's</a> not, as my council colleagues mentioned, this is not going to get any easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10398.623s">in</a> November or next year or the following election. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10402.425s">And</a> the position is needed, and it's a long time coming in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10407.347s">We're</a> able to get through elections for many years, but I think now's the time we have to, as a community, step up our game and ensure the integrity of our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10415.89s">And</a> in doing so, hire the appropriate personnel to make sure that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10420.652s">Second,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10425.274s">That's</a> a wrong motion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11933.821s">Mr.</a> President, did you not meet or was the Board of Health Director not in this chamber and gave approval to this set up, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11947.075s">Can</a> you not go to a restaurant, indoor or outdoor, and sit six feet from someone else without plexiglass, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11957.963s">Have</a> we not been told, Mr. President, that we can't exceed 25 people in this chamber, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11964.709s">Do</a> we exceed those numbers, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11967.271s">Have</a> we adhered to all the rules and regulations, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11972.216s">If</a> my colleague wants to stick his head in the sand, but meanwhile attend every rally possible, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11979.682s">Everywhere,</a> we've got hundreds of people gliding in and shaking hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11983.863s">Then</a> so be it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11985.724s">It</a> is the height of hypocrisy, Mr. President, to stand there and say that someone would be in danger attending this meeting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11995.106s">Shame</a> on whoever's spreading that around, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12220.305s">And</a> you also endorsed candidates that you were passing off ballots to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12223.468s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=14331.422s">Mr.</a> President, several months back I put on the agenda that we asked that a crosswalk be painted at the intersection of Everett Street and Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=14342.548s">Can</a> we please get an update from DPW or the Traffic Commission regarding the crosswalk at Everett and Salem?<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_qIvMl_-GSJQ/2024-11-19_qIvMl_-GSJQ.html">City Council 08-25-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=181.22s">Thank</a> You mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for taking this out of order We have a number of residents from Dutton Circle Underneath a blue tent tonight on their front lawn as we can see them all waving And I'd like to speak on their behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=197.505s">Mr.</a> President regarding an issue that took place back in 2017 when residents woke up to a <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=205.967s">national</a> grid cutting down two trees apparently that were interfering with high tension wires on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=214.035s">Shortly</a> after that, Mr. President, the city came by and ripped out two stumps and then set forms to pour new cement sidewalks because the city ripped up about 150 feet of sidewalk along Dutton Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=231.409s">And</a> this was not at the request of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=233.89s">It</a> was because of the work done by National Grid, the safety work that was done by National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=239.333s">Fast</a> forward almost three years later, the residents are still waiting to get the sidewalk poured in cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=247.476s">The</a> farms are still there on the street from 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=250.34s">There</a> are raised water shutoff valves that are causing a trip and fall hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=258.909s">And</a> Mr. President, I received a call about <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=262.353s">It's</a> probably about three hours ago from Commissioner Kerins and Highway Director Steve Tanaglia. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=269.655s">And</a> they assured me tonight, Mr. President, and they were out there today mocking off the sidewalk, that the residents on Dutton Circle, the long-awaited three years for these sidewalks that they were promised by the previous administration, will now be poured very shortly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=287.399s">And</a> I want to thank the residents of Dutton Circle for their patience on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=291.762s">I</a> want to thank the city administration for moving in a quick manner on this administration, moving in a quick manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=300.589s">And</a> I want to thank Commissioner Kearns and Steve Tanaglia for their due diligence on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=306.653s">I</a> think there are a few residents, Mr. President, I know Emily's on, that would probably just like to speak briefly to the council, if you would indulge. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=314.918s">Okay,</a> thank you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=316.399s">Emily,</a> would you like to speak?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=907.78s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=909.461s">And</a> I want to thank my other colleagues for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=912.964s">You</a> know, this has been, I probably put this on the agenda for the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=917.248s">And</a> it's been a major issue in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=919.99s">Originally,</a> it started out in South Method on the Somerville Method line. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=924.113s">Then</a> the Heights received a large amount of infestation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=929.158s">The</a> Wellington area, which I live in, was recently baited and trapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=934.702s">put</a> down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=935.923s">And</a> I think as part of an ordinance, you know, I like this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=941.507s">I</a> think it needs to be properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=943.128s">I</a> agree with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=945.109s">However,</a> we do have to look at enforcement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=949.012s">Many</a> residents in this community are complaining about people leaving trash outside <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=954.876s">food</a> in the backyard, leaving open invitation for these vermins to come in and feed and feast. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=963.784s">And</a> that's why they're hanging around. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=966.186s">Another</a> issue, Mr. President, is, in my opinion, the lack of baiting and trapping in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=972.251s">We're</a> not as aggressive as I believe we should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=974.953s">And</a> that's, I think, a discussion we need to have with the city administration when we start vetting out the ordinance itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=982.058s">The</a> last point, Mr. President, I have is regarding private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=987.642s">I've</a> heard all too many times when the city goes out and they start doing their baiting and trapping that they've witnessed Borrowing and nest on private property and I can understand the city can't be the gatekeeper for everyone's property however, if there's a nuisance of a property that's in a particular neighborhood and the city's aware they can see that there's nest and infiltration and <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1013.477s">and</a> so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1014.838s">I</a> think more needs to be done, Mr. President, to work with homeowners and maybe work with absentee landlords that may not give a damn, that don't live in the area, to be quite honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1025.501s">And</a> I think we have to do more as a community to safeguard the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1029.722s">And</a> if we do locate these nests that are borrowed into private property, I think the concern should be with the residents as well as the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1040.406s">And</a> I think that'll go a long way to curbing <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1043.767s">the</a> rat problem that we've had in the community for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1048.99s">This</a> is not a recent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1051.611s">It's</a> not because of just recent construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1054.533s">This</a> has been ongoing for many, many years in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1057.274s">And</a> I look forward to having a dialogue, Mr. President, where we can address this by city ordinance and also by enforcement and outreach, which needs to happen as well in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1069.361s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1210.561s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1212.022s">Just</a> if I could, as we all know, we also have many state roads and state parcels of land in the community, which the city is not responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1222.11s">And</a> I need to say that I did reach out immediately to Representative Donato because it was the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1230.254s">And</a> he was quick to respond, Mr. President, regarding concerns and quick to address it on the state level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1237.42s">And</a> I just want to thank Representative Donato for his work.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2656.526s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2657.747s">I</a> want to thank, uh, my colleague Councilor Knight for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2661.209s">Uh,</a> Councilor Caraviello, I have two kids I can drop off tomorrow, if that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2665.933s">Um,</a> Mr. President, um, you know, for many years in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2672.723s">We've</a> had accessory dwelling units, however, they're just not permitted or authorized. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2680.97s">And</a> those, what I refer to, are illegal basement apartments, illegal attic apartments, and a number of other illegal attachments to homes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2691.658s">And</a> this has been an issue of contention for a lot of years in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2696.522s">especially</a> thickly settled neighborhoods, because you'll see an influx of cars, you'll see an influx of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2705.409s">However,</a> these particular illegal units currently are not being permitted by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2713.094s">So</a> there's number one, there's a safety concern with electrical, plumbing, heating, you name it, there's a safety concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2721.2s">And</a> also taxes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2723.962s">Many</a> of these illegal apartments that currently exist now don't pay taxes to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2728.987s">So</a> this discussion is well warranted in the community, and it's something that I agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2734.811s">And</a> at the very least, we should be looking at in-law apartments, because I agree with my colleagues to allow residents that are at a certain age to stay in their units or their houses, I think makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2750.765s">We</a> also have to be mindful of the flip side, that once we bring this above board, that we will have an influx into our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2762.117s">And</a> if you think parking is a concern right now, it's going to become even more of a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2767.223s">And</a> then we have to look at resident permit parking, potentially citywide permit parking, like they do in Cambridge and Somerville and other surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2776.688s">So</a> this actually is probably a great issue to bring up because it's going to bring everything that's currently happening, happening illegal in the community above board right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2787.194s">And</a> we could take a good hard look at how we want to approach this issue, but also be mindful that we don't want our neighborhoods to turn into an area where there's going to be a mass exodus because there are so many units in an area that it becomes unlivable for residents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2805.925s">So</a> I think there's a happy median here that we have to find, but the issue definitely needs to be broached. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2813.85s">And</a> I look forward to having that discussion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2891.492s">Not</a> to cut you off, Kelly, and I appreciate what you said, but remember that not all streets are permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2898.417s">And</a> it's great to say we have permits, but that's not the case on many, many streets in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2904.162s">So</a> in order to implement what you're talking about, we'd have to do some type of permit citywide parking.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5006.59s">I</a> just want to touch upon what Councilor Scott probably mentioned regarding the ventilation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5011.576s">Alicia,</a> do you know if we're looking at ventilation upgrades to all the schools throughout the system?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5020.353s">Okay,</a> the reason why I ask is that during the budget, the school committee came out with a laundry list of priorities and recommendations if they had additional money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5034.117s">Have</a> they put anything in priority for this additional funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5038.539s">I</a> mean, they're well, we haven't approved it, but they're well aware there's money out there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5044.681s">Have</a> they put anything in writing to what they're looking at?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5053.021s">Right,</a> but we're being asked to appropriate money.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5066.067s">Well,</a> my recommendation would be similar to what I think Councilor Scarpelli was alluding to, that whatever is done with this particular money, that it go towards the eventual reopening of the schools regarding ventilation, safety needs, PPE, whatever else is needed in order and when it's safe to get back into school.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5103.258s">Okay,</a> well, we'll take out the supply stuff, but anything regarding the cost to reopen our schools eventually, I think would be an important expenditure at this particular stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5117.258s">We've</a> been talking about restrooms, the <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5120.242s">bubblers,</a> water bubblers in the high school for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5124.964s">And</a> I think that's warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5126.765s">I'd</a> like to see as a part of a contingent, a part of the approval of this council, that we receive an update immediately from the school committee when they do get together and meet to see what their priorities are and what they plan on spending this money for.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5179.477s">And</a> that we put a priority, Mr. Clerk, that we put a priority on any expenditures for the eventual reopening of public schools regarding safety, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5194.631s">the</a> ventilation system, security, whatever else needs to be in place in order for us, our teachers, our staff, and our children to safely go back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5205.561s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5849.925s">Order</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5851.585s">Order</a> of information, Council of Arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5853.726s">I</a> thought we were just told by Alicia that there was funding available for the HVAC and ventilation, other than this money.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5884.755s">Right,</a> so we wouldn't be holding any money back regarding ventilation or the needs at the high school at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5892.446s">What</a> we would be doing, and I agree with some of my colleagues, is stating before we give out any money that we should be asking, what are the projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5900.998s">which</a> makes sense to me at this particular stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5904.761s">So</a> at this particular point, Mr. President, I would offer a motion that the council hold back on giving out this particular funding until we do receive a communication from the school committee on what their priorities are and what they intend to spend the, what is it, $815,000 combined? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5920.856s">Is</a> that what it is, Alicia?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5935.943s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, knowing that the CARES Act funding and other additional funding is there to address some of the immediate needs, that this particular money, where we are the appropriating body for this, that we ask that the school committee come back and give us a list of what their priorities and needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5953.891s">And</a> at that point, I don't think there's anyone opposed to addressing the concerns of the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5959.353s">So</a> I'd put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6130.587s">So</a> what is the actual cost to repair and update the HVA system at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6138.512s">We</a> don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6140.093s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6142.034s">This</a> is all conjecture, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6144.675s">We</a> have no idea what the actual cost is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6147.697s">Mr.</a> President, and to just go through something blindly, because even if we appropriate this money and we still need millions of dollars, where are we then, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6157.079s">So</a> we should be getting a report from the school side telling us exactly what the cost is, what they're going to do, and what monies are needed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6166.38s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6168.781s">I</a> don't know how you operate government not knowing that information.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6192.687s">Surprise,</a> surprise.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6215.67s">Motion</a> is to table, Mr. President, until we get a correspondence back from the school committee regarding what their priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6222.895s">And</a> if it's the HVA system, Mr. President, we should know how they're going to spend it and what it's going to cost before we allocate money.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6975.487s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6976.508s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Caraviello for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6979.771s">Clearly,</a> Mr. President, we can't circumvent any collective bargaining issues or concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6985.395s">So</a> if that indeed is the case, then this will be ironed out in that particular realm. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6991.46s">Mr.</a> President, what Councilor Caraviello just alluded to is a serious public safety concern in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6998.403s">We</a> roughly have 35 details per week that go unfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7004.046s">That</a> means that when an outside entity, utility company that wants to do business in the community reaches out to the Medford Police Department, they can't find anyone <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7015.506s">on</a> the police department to fill these particular public safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7021.367s">And</a> that is very concerning to me, Mr. President, as one member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7025.948s">Additionally,</a> Mr. President, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, the city gets an administrative fee on every detail, whether it's someone from the city of Medford doing the detail, or if it's someone from the Somerville Police Department that's filling in, or the Everett Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7042.512s">We</a> get a 15% administrative fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7045.753s">If</a> you add up the number of details that go unfilled in the course of the year, we're talking roughly $100,000 that the city of Medford is leaving on the table, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7058.277s">We</a> just went through a budget crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7060.497s">We</a> just talked about laying teachers off. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7062.758s">We</a> just talked about not rehiring police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7065.719s">And</a> here we are leaving $100,000 on the table, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7070.3s">which</a> is a financial concern as well as a public safety concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7075.707s">We</a> also had, if people recall back some years ago, we had a fatality at one of these work sites, Mr. President, on Salt Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7084.939s">So</a> this is of grave concern in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7088.944s">for</a> our offices as well as public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7092.607s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Caraviello that indeed, if we can get retired police officers that are willing to do this particular work, Mr. President, and work it out with the unions and work it out with collective bargaining, this is a win-win for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7109.702s">So</a> I support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President, and I look forward to hearing from, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7116.828s">The</a> union rep is also on, and I look forward to hearing his comments as well, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8315.416s">Mr.</a> President, I too would like to thank Council Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8319.357s">As</a> I stated in the past, he was the first person actually to bring up the fact that there was funding available through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8326.919s">And</a> that was back so many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8329.379s">And</a> I think some people looked at him like he had three heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8332.36s">And</a> now we're seeing that his one head worked very well for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8337.501s">And</a> we appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8339.703s">Mr.</a> President, I appreciate the Bloomberg donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8344.287s">However,</a> we can't lose sight that the original intent of this was to privately raise the full amount of the funds that we got from the state, which was about $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8356.977s">And</a> we have fallen short of that mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8361.02s">So</a> this is great that we got some money, but we're still looking for about $6 or $7 million in private funds so the taxpayers won't have to bear the burden because that was the original intent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8373.745s">So,</a> you know, let's get out there and let's find some other rich donors in this community and move forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8730.133s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8731.173s">I</a> appreciate my colleague, Councilor Morell, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8735.296s">I</a> happen to have attended the June 17th co-sponsored meeting between the City of Medford and the Medford Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8744.602s">And</a> the conversation was around racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8747.744s">and</a> ways that we can work together as a community to stamp out racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8752.708s">I</a> know we broke into a number of working groups and I believe there were a number of recommendations made. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8759.834s">There</a> were over 250 residents that attended the Zoom call. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8763.977s">uh</a> for participation and like I said we broke into different breakout groups and I think that was one way of getting some community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8772.341s">Yes</a> indeed we do have to get community input on a much wider scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8777.183s">I</a> would just ask that we don't recreate the wheel and that whatever we do that we move in unison as a community so we don't have all these different groups <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8786.527s">often</a> their own, Mr. President, and never really amount to anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8790.41s">So</a> I know July 8th, the Human Rights Commission invited public participation once again at their regularly scheduled meeting to discuss next steps for addressing racism as a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8804.418s">And</a> I think getting these organizations all together, Mr. President, if we do have a subcommittee meeting, I think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8814.642s">But</a> I would also ask that the Human Rights Commission and any other board of commission that may be able to assist, we can have Neil Osborne, the Director of Human Diversity, attend as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8829.387s">And</a> I think this is going to take the old saying, it's going to take a village, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8834.331s">And</a> indeed, we have to get a wide range of community members and involvement to move forward on the next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8842.837s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10725.873s">Mr.</a> President, have you set up a follow-up meeting with the marijuana ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10737.164s">I</a> have reached out to Jonathan.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_XL6CFVX_DxQ/2024-11-19_XL6CFVX_DxQ.html">City Council 07-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1386.664s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1389.464s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1392.521s">You</a> know, we are in the process, as many residents know, we hired an attorney to help us with our review of our zoning ordinances that haven't been reviewed in over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1406.611s">I</a> think many people in this community realize that there are many changes that need to happen, many updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1413.296s">And</a> I would agree with some of the previous speakers that we really do need to look at a comprehensive amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1419.741s">And</a> I appreciate the fact that the mayor is trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1422.643s">put</a> forward what she believes is in the best interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1426.267s">However,</a> I'd like to look at a total picture when I arrive at a decision, and I don't believe this arrives at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1435.016s">There</a> is an issue, Mr. President, I've raised on many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1438.299s">before</a> the council and regarding zoning is the fact that we're seeing many buildings pop up that have very little community feel and community impact other than providing additional housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1452.992s">And</a> I've always stated, Mr. President, that we have to make sure that we're not just creating big blocks <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1460.118s">residential</a> places that really have no community feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1464.682s">So</a> whatever I do as a member of the council, I'm going to be cognizant of the fact that I will be mindful of adding a component, like we mentioned about mixed use and so forth, and whatever votes I take, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1858.442s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1859.903s">I</a> would also ask that KP Law be invited for advice as well as the acting city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1868.326s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1870.627s">They've</a> both been instrumental in- Councilor Marks, is that an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1875.889s">If</a> you want that in the form of amendment, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1877.91s">I'll</a> use it as an amendment.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3000.928s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3004.269s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3005.249s">I</a> would ask that the city of Medford and Tufts University put together a list of contacts for area residents, a clerk of the work that would be responsible for the project, and any questions that residents may have.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3040.632s">A</a> list of project contact names and numbers, as well as the city of Medford to have a clerk of the works that is responsible for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3053.311s">And</a> I know Mr. DeRico said he has a list of abutters and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3057.375s">I'm</a> sure he can disseminate some information that way and the city can also add it to its city website and local community access as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3066.343s">So</a> residents know that they have a place and a person to talk to if need be.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3554.223s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3555.383s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3557.072s">Mr.</a> President, as many residents are aware, we're undergoing a major infrastructure project going on right now with Eversource that's coming down Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3570.046s">And</a> there's going to be much disruption to the area, as well as South Street and Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3576.853s">And</a> I did have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3585.401s">using</a> the existing trenches that will be dug by Eversource? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3590.225s">Or</a> will they be creating their own trenches? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3593.127s">They</a> also mentioned underground laterals and cables and wires. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3597.591s">Is</a> that going to be part of the extensive digging and trenching that Eversource is going to do for their electrical transmission? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3606.418s">So</a> I have a number of questions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3609.32s">I'm</a> not sure if, you know, we don't meet until the end of August. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3615.469s">So</a> I'm not sure if time is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3618.55s">I</a> don't know if we have our city engineer on tonight as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3621.711s">I</a> thought I may have seen his name. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3625.233s">Mr.</a> Clark, do you know if he's on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3661.163s">Why</a> don't we just move it to the end of the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3663.864s">And</a> then if they don't show up, Mr. President, I would agree with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3668.907s">Because</a> there's already a major project going on there, and I'm not sure the extent of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3673.65s">We</a> don't know the hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3675.551s">We</a> don't know if they're going to be working in conjunction with National Grid and Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3680.514s">I</a> really don't know anything about the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3684.861s">So</a> that's what I would ask, that we move this to the end of the agenda calendar.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3707.898s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3708.879s">Second,</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3873.866s">Mr.</a> President, I would move that we suspend the reading of the remaining <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3880.372s">remainder</a> in that this be placed and tabled with is not a representative from National Grid, that it be placed at the end of the agenda as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3889.556s">Okay,</a> on the motion of Council... Was there another comment?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4472.366s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4474.887s">I</a> would ask that if the council is all right with that, that we amended to allow for any correspondence from Tufts University to be passed off to us as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4502.608s">A</a> B paper is fine, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4527.215s">That's</a> accurate.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5869.828s">I</a> will leave that call, Mr. President, up to the city engineer and the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5874.01s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6046.379s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6047.72s">And</a> I believe there may be one or two residents from the area on with us tonight that would also want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6054.601s">So</a> I just want to let that be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6057.522s">I</a> received a number of phone calls and emails, Mr. President, from area residents in the Washington Street, Spring Street, Bradshaw Street area regarding speeding traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6070.665s">This</a> is not common to this particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6073.686s">We</a> receive calls constantly throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6076.848s">And</a> one issue that I've brought up over many years was instituting traffic calming initiatives like they do in many other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6087.055s">I've</a> been on the city of Cambridge website, the city of Somerville, and we don't have to recreate the wheel, many of the initiatives <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6095.86s">are</a> out there and things that we can take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6099.081s">One,</a> Mr. President, that I believe our city has fallen short on the mark is the raised crosswalks that I've mentioned for the last at least 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6110.366s">Back</a> several years ago, Mayor McGlynn offered to do a pilot program <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6116.608s">with</a> three raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6119.571s">And</a> to date, we have only implemented one of the three that was studied and approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6127.619s">And</a> that is on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6129.902s">I</a> would ask Mr. President in the interest of public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6133.405s">in</a> the interest of taking our roads back from speeding traffic, that this particular area of Washington, Bradshaw, Spring Street, receive a traffic study, a formal traffic study on speeding cars, as well as the need for additional signage, Mr. President, in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6156.461s">And</a> the day after, I believe it was, that I received one of the emails, I got a follow-up email from the same gentleman that said he witnessed a young boy get hit in the street by a car, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6170.015s">I</a> don't think it was very serious, but it was enough, Mr. President, to alarm <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6175.1s">residents</a> of what is taking place in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6179.065s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President, in the interest of public safety, that our Traffic Commission quickly move forward on the <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6189.585s">creation</a> of a traffic study in this area, the implementation of traffic calming initiatives, whether it's widening sidewalks, whether it's putting road markings, whether it's a raised crosswalk, blinking lights, whatever it might be, Mr. President, to increase safety in the area, I think would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6214.54s">We've,</a> as a council, have mentioned this ad nauseum regarding many other streets in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6220.525s">And</a> I really believe, and this is no reflection on any current administration, but we really do a poor job when it comes to controlling the speed within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6233.354s">And</a> when people don't feel safe taking their dog for a walk or taking their child for a walk or going for a jog, you know there's a concern in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6242.979s">And</a> many of our secondary roads are becoming cut-through roads with all the Waze applications and other applications people are using, and drivers are finding any which way to get through our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6256.428s">And</a> that's creating much of the chaos we're hearing about on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6261.051s">So</a> I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that that be sent to the Traffic Commission, and they look at additional signage on those streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6271.437s">and</a> the commission of a traffic study for implementation of some traffic calming initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6277.739s">And</a> I believe we have Ed Serino from the area and maybe Tony Mosca, I believe also may be on the Zoom meeting tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6332.2s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6333.421s">And</a> any other traffic calming initiatives that the city can think of?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6616.282s">I</a> agree with the previous speaker, and I would ask that Todd Blake, our traffic engineer, look at a citywide approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6624.467s">This</a> council has been requesting that for many years, and we tend to take things up piecemeal, like we did on Salt Street and many other streets, because there hasn't been a formalized approach to look at the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6636.853s">So</a> I am in full support of looking at the entire city, but as I get calls and emails <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6642.456s">I</a> react to those calls, Mr. President, and I would ask that Todd Blake be as part of my motion that he look at a citywide approach to traffic calming issues as was mentioned by the previous speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6657.282s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6663.29s">If</a> we could, Mr. President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=6665.472s">I've</a> got it, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7992.832s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7994.314s">Thank</a> you, Commissioner Mulkey, for being on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7999.178s">When</a> you mentioned some projects, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8001.901s">that</a> the historic commission wanted to see come before them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8007.605s">Does</a> that include porches?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8068.185s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8068.745s">And</a> would that also include vinyl siding?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8081.993s">And</a> prior to the meeting that you held with the city administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8087.541s">What</a> items were you actually sending? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8091.442s">Was</a> it just demolition to the historic commission or was it these generalized construction like replacement windows and porches and roof lines and everything else that's involved?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8112.03s">And</a> you're saying the language that states demolition delay or parts thereof, the or parts thereof is the issue that they're hanging their hat on saying, well, this involves more than the demolition of a building.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8146.815s">It</a> absolutely is a vague term. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8148.516s">And</a> I would ask, Mr. President, if we could, when the Commissioner Mochi does arrive at whatever the standards are going to be that he shared with the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8159.022s">Because</a> I, as one member of the council, never envisioned to have residents that may want to, under this demolition delay, may want to do some work on their property and have them run into a financial cost or say, you know what, it's not worth doing this additional work because I don't feel like waiting or going through another process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8180.464s">So</a> I, as one member of the council, am extremely interested in seeing what you come up with, Commissioner Mulkey. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8187.006s">And</a> if that's the case, I would move forward on redrafting our ordinance to exclude that language of all parts thereof to make sure that we're not putting an undue burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8198.91s">I</a> think we all want to save historic property. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8201.471s">But</a> I'd venture to say 70 or 80% of our homes are greater than 75 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8208.016s">And</a> I don't see how logistically, we already have an overburdened historic commission, an overburdened building commission department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8215.721s">And</a> to create another layer that may discourage residents from doing work on their personal property, and then maybe an additional expense is not something that I signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8226.549s">And</a> I'll make sure that that doesn't come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8229.631s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8993.556s">Just</a> if I could quickly, I know a lot of people want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8995.978s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8996.979s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, Council Vice President Caraviello said to meet with the historic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9003.044s">I</a> have no problem doing that, but it's my understanding this was a directive from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9009.469s">And</a> I think the best person to have in the room would probably be the city administration as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9015.693s">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9015.974s">We're</a> going to get to the bottom of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9018.716s">We'll</a> have all the so-called players in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9022.332s">Sounds</a> good.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9037.362s">Whoever</a> the city administration would like to send.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12440.397s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12443.518s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12446.339s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12448.181s">And</a> I, too, have a statement tonight that I'd like to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12452.063s">I</a> first heard the phrase Black Lives Matter back in 2012, when Trayvon Martin was shot to death. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12459.287s">After</a> that, Michael Brown, a young African-American, was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12466.331s">Then</a> another African-American, Eric Gander, died after being put in a chokehold by the New York City police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12475.643s">These</a> incidences and many others leading up to George Floyd's murder this year have led me to understand how the seeds of slavery, discrimination, and prejudice continue to threaten the ability of black Americans and others to equally enjoy the freedoms that we profess as a country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12496.596s">So</a> I am proud to join with so many others and state that black lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12501.857s">I</a> do so with the desire that in making this statement, it will facilitate the clear acknowledgement of the destructive effect that discrimination and prejudice has had and continues to have in our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12516.64s">And</a> my hope will encourage all Americans to work to erase inequality. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12523.746s">But</a> as we consider this resolution, I have an important question for the mayor about hanging banners on public buildings such as City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12533.094s">My</a> question is directed at the mayor because she has full authority over this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12539.499s">My</a> question is this, what standards or procedures does the mayor use in deciding what signs or messages will be placed on City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12551.892s">The</a> reason that I ask this question is because the right to use a government building to display a message is not unlimited. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12560.754s">This</a> is especially true if the building is a public forum like City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12566.815s">If</a> the mayor is going to allow City Hall to be used to display various messages, then the First Amendment requires that the city not discriminate among various messages or points of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12580.606s">Any</a> standard applied by the city must be content neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12586.428s">An</a> example would be if a pro-life group wanted to hang a banner on City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12592.23s">The</a> city could not prohibit that, and nor could it prohibit a pro-choice group from also having its banner placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12600.032s">So</a> you can see that we should receive from the mayor a description of what the standards she applies in hanging banners. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12609.321s">Otherwise,</a> we could be at risk of turning City Hall building into a billboard battle zone of conflicting and possibly polarizing messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12620.433s">In</a> Method, we have experienced the impact that banners and signs have on our rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12627.014s">It</a> was just two years ago when this council voted to stop using the VFW building on Mystic Ave as a voting location because some voters stated they were less inclined to vote because of a sign displayed on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12644.038s">I</a> mention this because City Hall itself is used as a voting location. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12649.741s">So</a> before we vote on a resolution, I am simply asking my council colleagues that we request that the mayor give us a full description of the standards or procedures she uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12668.35s">Having</a> the mayor respond is a prudent and reasonable step to take when First Amendment and other rights are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12677.113s">So</a> at this point, Mr. President, I would offer a motion to receive and place on file the original resolution of paper 20-497. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12688.88s">And</a> I offer a motion requesting that the mayor provide the council with the full description of the standards or procedures the mayor uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12707.349s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12709.11s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12727.923s">Not</a> at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12728.904s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12730.365s">So</a> it would be a motion requesting that the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12736.681s">provide</a> the council with a full description of the standards or procedures the mayor uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12766.476s">So</a> the first motion was to receive and place on file the original resolution, which is paper 20-497. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12773.841s">And</a> then the motion was what I just offered, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12778.565s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12925.514s">I</a> appreciate Councilor Bears bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12928.398s">I</a> just want to draw the light, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12930.681s">There</a> was a recent court case just entered in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12933.305s">District</a> Court on July 1st, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12937.33s">And</a> it's the case of Judicial Watch versus the mayor of D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12942.712s">And</a> on June 5th of this year, Mr. President, artists, demonstrators, residents, and employees of D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12950.595s">painted</a> Black Lives Matter on 16th Street in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12955.917s">The</a> next day, June 6th, protesters painted Defund the Police next to Black Lives Matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12963.074s">The</a> mayor of DC, Muriel Bowser, supported the painting on the street, but there was no permit or approval process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12972.364s">Judicial</a> Watch then wrote to Mayor Bowser and asked that their model, because no one is above the law, be painted on another street of the similar size. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12985.902s">In</a> its letter to the mayor, Judicial Watch said it has tried to find procedures for getting approval for painting a message on a street near its offices, but could not find any procedures or permit process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13000.216s">The</a> deputy mayor then wrote back to Judicial Watch and said that it should apply for a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13006.397s">Judicial</a> Watch then checked out the District of Columbia's website, but could not find a permit process to paint on a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13014.949s">And</a> when it contacted the Public Works Department, it was told, we never heard of that permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13021.274s">Judicial</a> Watch then entered the lawsuit alleging a violation of its First Amendment rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13027.52s">The</a> basis for its claim is the mayor favors one message over another, and that the city does not have any standards or procedures in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13038.45s">So</a> I just want to make it be known, Mr. President, I think it's prudent that this council move forward to find out what are the standards and what are the procedures, Mr. President, because clearly anything could be challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13053.06s">And</a> clearly that if we do open up messaging on City Hall, it will open up other First Amendment rights and other concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13063.167s">And</a> I think it's only prudent that we move forward as a community <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13067.329s">and</a> make sure that if the mayor decides, and I agree with Councilor Knight, this is totally under the mayor's purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13075.594s">This</a> has nothing to do with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13078.015s">And</a> if Councilor Bears wanted to move this forward, for the past six months, he could have approached the mayor at any given time and had that discussion with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13088.08s">He</a> opted to come before a body that has no input, and that's his prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13093.883s">But</a> unless he already approached the mayor, and the mayor denied him of the sign, which I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13100.649s">But</a> clearly, the city administration has control, as well as the building commissioner of the buildings, and it's not the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13109.036s">But</a> I'm willing, Mr. President, to find out what the rules and regulations are and move that forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13235.388s">Mr.</a> President, I did have a resident reach out to me that is employed with the City of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13241.092s">And</a> they did mention to me that when the City of Boston has a policy in place, that when they put banners up, it's usually a message from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13251.718s">And</a> that's how they've been able to work it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13253.838s">So</a> they put out a message from mayor, whatever it is, and then the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13258.64s">And</a> that may be something that could be in a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13261.86s">I</a> don't think anyone's saying no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13263.521s">I</a> think what we're saying is we'd like to see what the policy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13266.941s">And</a> I would disagree with my council colleague if he doesn't think a permit or policy should be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13273.483s">City</a> Hall is one building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13275.283s">Are</a> we going to do it on the school buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13277.683s">Are</a> we going to do it on the police building? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13279.364s">Are</a> we going to do it in our fire stations, our library? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13282.124s">I</a> mean, we can go through the list of buildings in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13285.825s">So</a> I think it is only prudent to be careful as we move forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13293.806s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13295.307s">Councilor</a> Bears?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13696.645s">I</a> don't know anyone that said that this is controversial, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13700.168s">We're</a> asking that we find out what the policies and procedures as an elected body, Mr. President, it's up to us to do our homework and our due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13709.033s">And</a> before we just vote on something to vote on it, we should find out what the policies and procedures are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13715.238s">That's</a> how elected officials act in their course of duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13718.64s">So</a> no one is dismissing anything and no one is saying there's no value or merit to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13724.144s">We're</a> saying we have to do our due diligence.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16947.893s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16949.495s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16951.036s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16952.271s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, my emotion, Mr. President was offered first and it was seconded first. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16959.235s">So</a> I'm not sure why you would take up that first, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16962.116s">I</a> would challenge the ruling of the chair.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16969.58s">The</a> first first person to speak might have been the first person to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16973.481s">I</a> don't remember emotion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17118.073s">If</a> I could just clarify the first motion, Mr. Clerk also mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17122.985s">paper</a> 20-497, which was Councilor Bears' original resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17128.367s">So</a> move to place 2497 on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17132.569s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17132.809s">Motion</a> to receive and place on file the original resolution of paper 20-497.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17170.427s">I</a> prefer we go what we have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17173.129s">That's</a> what was seconded, and that's what I prefer we go with.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17263.205s">This</a> is on the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17265.947s">Hang</a> on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17266.928s">There's</a> two separate motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17268.368s">This</a> is the first motion to receive the paper in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17272.151s">And</a> the second motion is the request to the mayor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17329.354s">No,</a> we still have the second part of this vote.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17333.055s">It</a> is a part two minutes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18943.074s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18944.337s">Council</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18946.935s">I</a> disagree with my colleague, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18949.716s">I</a> believe that this is an appropriate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18953.017s">The</a> paper is currently before the council, and if we want to get it properly vetted through the Community Development Board, which would be a public hearing through the Community Development Board, I think this would be an ideal time, actually, to get this particular language vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18968.405s">And</a> then it has to come back to us, and we can have our legal counsel, Kim Scanlon and KP Law, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18973.747s">take</a> a look at the language to make sure it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18976.428s">I'm</a> under the impression that the city of Boston has a similar language, if not exact language, that mirrors this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18984.252s">And</a> I believe it spells out a concern that we have for clarification that a brew pub would be listed as a restaurant, and that's based on the sale of 25% or more of its beer on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18999.319s">And</a> I think that's a great distinction and something that's needed in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19004.323s">And</a> so I would support moving this forward tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19386.66s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19388.902s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19391.581s">I</a> thought what was mentioned at the outset that we have to go through this process all over again anyways, because we didn't make the time constraints that were imposed on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19402.566s">So</a> this is nothing more than adding a definition to the current brewing ordinance that we have that's going to probably be vetted once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19412.611s">And</a> if anything, Mr. President, this is merely stating that <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19421.033s">Food</a> will be 75% of what's sold in the establishment, which would make it a restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19427.37s">And</a> only 25% can be of a brewing nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19431.611s">So</a> it's actually very different than the other definitions, where it heavily relies on the brewing and not the food. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19440.733s">And</a> so this is more food-related than it is brewing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19445.134s">And</a> I think it fits well into this, because it gives people an option, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19450.335s">So</a> I think it will probably be vetted out as we go along. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19453.936s">So</a> I will support it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19455.876s">knowing</a> that we still have many meetings in front of us, Mr. President, to go forward with this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19536.901s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could add, we were fortunate enough, and I appreciate all the work Council and I did on this, believe me, and other members of the council, we put a lot of time and effort into this, as well as Mark Rumley, former city solicitor, who actually got this ball rolling as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19557.135s">But</a> we were fortunate enough to have a couple of Method residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19561.838s">that</a> are in the brewing business to assist us and help us along in crafting this ordinance to make it work for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19569.865s">So</a> I only see that as a positive that we had the ability to have someone there give us some guidance and there was many times that we asked for guidance to make sure we crafted something that wasn't a Somerville ordinance or Cambridge or Boston but a Method ordinance to see how it worked for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19588.04s">And</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19589.801s">I</a> continue to look for advice and assistance and any other assistance I can get from the people that have the expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19599.166s">Because</a> I'm not a brewing expert, I don't know the number of barrels, I don't know anything that... <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19604.548s">what</a> I have to do my homework and research. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19606.87s">And</a> from what I see with this, Mr. President, it will be properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19610.993s">We're</a> not asking that this be voted on tonight and then become an ordinance, ordained ordinance, in the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19617.377s">We're</a> saying that this has to go through the entire process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19621.02s">Unfortunately,</a> we have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19622.501s">We</a> have to go through the entire process and have another public hearing and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19627.425s">Even</a> though much of the language has been vetted out, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19630.574s">So</a> I hear what Councilor Knight's saying, but I think we should at least give this the opportunity to be added and then properly vetted.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22203.702s">Mr.</a> President, were you on the <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22206.092s">the</a> National Grid one? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22208.213s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22208.834s">This</a> is 20-479. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22211.875s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22212.396s">I</a> do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22213.456s">Yes,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22216.138s">Regarding</a> the Eversource, how much of your project is related to the Eversource project? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22221.821s">And</a> if so, what is being done that both of you are working on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22248.37s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22248.63s">So</a> when you talk about underground laterals, cables, and wires, is that happening?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22264.93s">Okay,</a> so this is not going to be, is it going to be coordinated with Eversource? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22268.871s">Oh,</a> of course, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22270.891s">Yes,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22272.732s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22275.152s">What's</a> the expected time this will take?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22294.672s">That's</a> all the questions I have, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22315.605s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22588.273s">He</a> was drinking water. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22589.393s">He</a> couldn't have seconded.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22591.773s">He</a> was a ventriloquist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22593.314s">He</a> definitely didn't second it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23000.159s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=818.638s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=819.759s">Not</a> to interrupt you, but it's always been the intention of, I believe, all seven councilors to have Zoom part of any process.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=839.33s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could finish my point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=841.991s">Okay,</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=843.852s">Just</a> if I could, with all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=845.893s">Over</a> the last several days, I've received a number of emails, which I welcome, much of which spoke about us as a council not wanting to have Zoom as an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=856.439s">which</a> is the furthest from the truth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=859.103s">So</a> I just want to let it be known that I as one member of the council, my council colleagues will speak for themselves, never once mentioned to stop council meetings on Zoom, stop budget meetings, it was to provide an additional avenue <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=872.461s">to</a> our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=873.682s">So</a> even if we did hold in-council meetings with department heads, those meetings would have been televised. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=881.108s">They</a> would have been available to Zoom for comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=883.61s">They</a> would have been available to Zoom for email. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=886.953s">They</a> would have been all open access, Mr. President, as council members. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=890.916s">And</a> if I can also mention, Mr. President, this is my 25th budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=895.299s">That</a> means 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=897.461s">I</a> take my job very serious, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=900.855s">And</a> I don't take it lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=902.756s">I've</a> never missed a budget in 25 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=907.399s">And</a> what happened recently, Mr. President, I think was unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=912.263s">And</a> my concern right now, Mr. President, is moving forward, getting past this, Mr. President, and offering people no one wants to do a wayward zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=921.689s">Anyone</a> that's telling you that hasn't been true to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=924.731s">We</a> are not doing a wayward zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=927.873s">There</a> are, as many business people know, and other people that are in the business world and so forth, there's a lot of complexity to putting together a budget, especially a budget that's 183 million, that deals with potentially hundreds of layoffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=941.701s">And</a> to work that type of budget over a Zoom meeting, for us to be present with each other- Mr. President, would be-
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=961.299s">Councilor</a> Marks, please continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=962.88s">Mr.</a> President, this was a point of information, but what I'm saying, Mr. President, there's a lot of things that go on in a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=970.665s">There's</a> sidebar conversations that we've had in the council when we discuss issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=975.788s">There's</a> a lot of things when we sit down and talk to department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=979.25s">Now,</a> Mr. President, if one minute someone felt the department head that they were unsafe, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=984.193s">Those</a> are the things we'd have to address, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=986.695s">And</a> maybe having a meeting is not the greatest idea in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=990.958s">But</a> I can tell you in the town of Canton and the town of Abington, they just recently, within the last couple of days, have held meetings with their town councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1000.625s">And</a> they address situations of social distancing, of providing masks, sanitary gloves, and so forth, whatever they needed to do to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1010.893s">And</a> all I'm saying is, I think we could have tried to accomplish that in the city of Medford, and also keeping Zoom and every other realm of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1018.695s">If</a> there's another one out there, that's you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1021.736s">You</a> yourself know we've opened up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1023.976s">We've</a> never had our budget meetings, since I've been on in 24 years, open other than arriving to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1030.738s">And</a> I realize this is a different time, arriving to City Hall and have people participate in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1036.219s">Now</a> for the first time, we have cameras in our council room that can capture these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1041.441s">There</a> is no way members of the council want to hide anything from the public, exclude the public, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1047.504s">So</a> I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1048.964s">I</a> know there's been a lot of information back and forth, and it makes for a good story. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1053.786s">Certain</a> people don't want to attend meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1056.287s">But</a> I can tell you, Mr. President, that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1059.409s">It's</a> not the case with me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1061.57s">I</a> look forward to moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1063.791s">And</a> as I've told people that contacted me, you can rest assured we're going to have a signed budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1068.313s">We're</a> going to have open debate, open dialogue, open comments, and we're going to have a signed budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1074.156s">Thank</a> you for indulging me for those few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1076.557s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1077.398s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1123.285s">Board</a> of Information Counsel Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1125.146s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1125.626s">And</a> I know my two colleagues have expressed themselves many times on social media and Twitter and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1132.27s">However,</a> Mr. President, this is the Medford City Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1135.651s">And</a> I think at the very least, it deserves the opportunity, Mr. President, to explore, which we asked for well over a month ago, to explore what options are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1144.816s">And</a> all I'm saying is we need the time to explore it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1148.319s">The</a> mayor has already come out asking us, saying if we're unable to get together on this, she's going to have to do a 1-12 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1154.485s">That</a> would be her wishes, not my wish. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1157.047s">I</a> think we can resolve this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1159.109s">I</a> think we can get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1160.61s">And</a> according to what Councilor Knight mentioned, that we're willing to stand by whatever the recommendation is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1166.271s">And</a> that includes the Mayor's recommendation, her Board of Health, the President of the Council, the gentleman from Local Access, and the Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1175.313s">So</a> whatever the recommendations are, Mr. President, that's what we're gonna stand by. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1179.174s">And</a> if it includes not having the public meeting at City Hall, then as far as I'm concerned, so be it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1186.574s">So</a> I don't see how this is going to wait another week, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1190.816s">And</a> if anything, maybe these public meetings should have been called one after another because you have a 48-hour wait period. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1198.82s">So</a> maybe these meetings should have been called so we do have meetings scheduled for the next couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1203.642s">And</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that maybe that's something you look at so we do have meetings set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1209.946s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1874.232s">I</a> need to say, Mr. President, I remember a day when there used to be some disagreements and Councilors would argue about issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1884.538s">But</a> what I have to say, Mr. President, is this council is going in a very different direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1891.041s">It's</a> a little troubling when a member of the council offers a resolution and other Councilors prior to it even being discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1901.133s">on</a> the agenda, start bashing a member of the council for offering a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1906.676s">Not</a> even listening, like they'll talk a big game saying, I want to hear what people have to say, but they start bashing someone before you have to hear what they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1916.781s">Point</a> of information got somewhere else.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1923.024s">I'm</a> not referring to the resolution, but thank you for your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1926.856s">Mr.</a> President, so what I'm saying, Mr. President, is very troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1931.543s">Everyone's</a> entitled to their own opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1933.546s">But</a> to start this back and forth, Mr. President, without listening, God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1941.618s">And</a> without listening to see what someone else has to say, we're never going to move forward, Mr. President, because we can't debate stuff on Twitter and email and all those other services, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1953.646s">That's</a> not how we operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1955.248s">And</a> I realize these are two new councils, and they're not privy to how maybe the council operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1960.331s">but</a> just for future, Mr. President, moving forward, have respect for other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1964.832s">You</a> may not agree what they have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1966.852s">You</a> may hate their resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1968.793s">You</a> may despise what they're saying, but give them the opportunity to say it and then have your say. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1974.634s">That's</a> all I'm saying this morning.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2243.486s">100%,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2447.972s">Mr.</a> President, I would respectfully ask that this be combined with the other paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2454.094s">They're</a> of similar subject matter, and I feel to do that at the beginning and ask that this be combined to the other paper.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2469.924s">Mr.</a> President, just for the interest of transparency, if you wanna read it, so people know what the resolution was.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2831.358s">Yes,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2833.159s">I'm</a> sitting on a low chair today, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2837.082s">Mr.</a> President, if we could have direct, not only just, maybe I missed it, what the balance is in the account after the 1.5 million is used?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2858.666s">The</a> reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, and this may be a discussion we can have during budget debates, is that the mayor already committed, I believe it was a little over $5 million in free cash towards offsetting our deficit here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2874.819s">And</a> I would respectfully request that in addition to the $5 million, that we also look at the water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2884.367s">And</a> I realize under state statute, it only allows us to use that money for certain purposes, and one being to offset a budget deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2894.736s">And</a> in the past, I've been on the council for a number of years, we have dipped into that money to use to offset our snow and ice account in the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2905.345s">The</a> reason why I state this, Mr. President, is it's very likely, even with the free cash, that there still is going to be some layoffs, in particular in the school side and some within police and fire and DPW, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2920.238s">And</a> I would ask that, respectfully, the city administration look at filing a home rule petition to tap into some of the additional 4 million plus that Director Nunley just mentioned that possibly is available that will keep us still maintaining the money for infrastructure and other emergency purposes, but also making sure, Mr. President, that we as a community don't have to experience the loss of teachers, guidance Councilors, police, fire, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2949.079s">and</a> other essential services within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2951.561s">So</a> I would just offer that as a B paper, Mr. President, that the city administration explore the option of filing a home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2960.546s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3155.065s">Is</a> that correct, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3156.225s">If</a> I could just clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3157.686s">To</a> look at the Water and Sewer Enterprise account and file a home rule petition and potentially offset any budget deficits that we may have with the Water and Sewer Enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3167.708s">The</a> remaining, I believe, was $400, $4 million and somewhat change that Director Nunley mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3173.829s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3174.589s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3175.529s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8755.924s">We</a> like I said, I just want to make sure that also, Mr. President, there are people that have been waiting to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8762.248s">And</a> we have people that have spoken twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8765.85s">Everyone</a> gets a fair chance to speak Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8789.808s">Oh,</a> interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8790.809s">What</a> a conspiracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8792.189s">What</a> a conspiracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8793.55s">Please.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8796.272s">What</a> a conspiracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8797.373s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8800.074s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=10076.329s">Are</a> we debating the budget tonight, mr. President, mr. President Time to debate the budget this is not a night to debate the budget.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11228.342s">I</a> just wanted to personally thank Malik for his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11231.023s">And</a> to me, a comment like that goes a long way in putting the divide down and moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11236.865s">And</a> I think that's what we all want right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11238.806s">And</a> I really appreciate those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11240.546s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11241.166s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11292.331s">Councilor</a> Marks, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11294.932s">I</a> think what Councilor Caraviello said was he was gonna wait till the regular agenda when we get back to the regular agenda to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11302.813s">I</a> won't speak for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=11303.893s">But</a> he also mentioned he's having problems with his- Right.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12731.487s">For</a> your information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12733.549s">Just</a> for the edification of the gentlemen, the city council does not decide the money that's given to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12740.715s">Just</a> to, you know, if we're gonna talk facts, let's talk facts.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12751.412s">That's</a> right, you don't have to approve our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12753.295s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12754.376s">You</a> don't approve- That's not what you said, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12756.479s">Let's</a> get the facts, what you're saying, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12758.482s">Facts</a> matter, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12759.784s">You</a> can't just speak and not- One at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12763.489s">Councilor</a> Marks has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12764.951s">Councilor</a> Marks has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12766.913s">Mr.</a> President, facts speak for themselves, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12770.014s">The</a> gentleman can't accept that that is not the process, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12774.715s">And</a> he's been saying a lot of things that aren't processed over the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12778.876s">He</a> should know what the process is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12781.377s">You</a> are correct.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14413.534s">Mr.</a> President, is she unmuted?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15198.03s">Council</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15199.31s">Mr.</a> President, I know there's a few people waiting because I received a text, but I'll be brief also in the interest of everyone's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15208.253s">Regarding</a> the council, I feel like I have a good working relationship with all the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15212.934s">Do</a> we need to approve upon things? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15214.935s">Absolutely,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15216.875s">I</a> agree with what was mentioned by my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15219.396s">I</a> think in the first six months of this year, this has been one of the most productive councils I've ever worked with. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15226.738s">The</a> pieces of legislation that we've put forward are amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15230.379s">The</a> marijuana ordinance and the list goes on and on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15235.661s">You</a> know, over the last couple of days, when I had people call me up and said, geez, Mike, what the heck's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15241.403s">And</a> I say, oh, about the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15243.103s">They</a> said, no, you and Adam Knight are voting on the same issue and you're in the same stance together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15248.725s">So,</a> you know, these are things, Mr. President, that we as a council, you know, we work through, we'll get through it, Mr. President, and I look forward to a productive remaining of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15261.1s">And</a> I think it's important regarding our own <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15267.507s">diversity,</a> and so forth, that you always keep an open mind, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15271.31s">I</a> approach everything with an open mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15273.792s">And</a> I always say, as my mother taught me, treat people as you would like to be treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15278.076s">And</a> that's what I walk through in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15279.477s">And</a> I try to do the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15280.998s">I</a> think we all have inherent prejudice that are built into us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15285.842s">And</a> I try to check myself every day regarding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15288.924s">Am</a> I perfect? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15289.905s">No,</a> but it's a work in progress, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15293.468s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16412.81s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16414.591s">Yes,</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16416.251s">I</a> believe there were a number of letters submitted to the council on the public participation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16422.774s">And</a> I would ask that they be received and placed on file, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17282.711s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17283.752s">I</a> put together an hour presentation for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17287.094s">So</a> I hope you guys would indulge me.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17292.577s">That</a> was a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17293.398s">That</a> was a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17294.538s">Mr.</a> President, as we know, over the last month or so, that outdoor dining has opened up in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17300.759s">And</a> there's been a lot of interest and suggestions how to use some of our major thoroughfares to assist local businesses and restaurants in using up some of the space in order to put outside dining. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17314.842s">The</a> Mass Department of Transportation just released their Shared Streets and Spaces grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17320.183s">And</a> it's a $300,000, up to $300,000 available. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17325.106s">And</a> the COVID-19 has highlighted some existing mobility needs, as well as the need for meaningful commerce to now be safely conducted on sidewalks and streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17338.276s">The</a> improvements include streets, curbs, sidewalks, on-street parking spaces, and off-street parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17345.767s">Improvements</a> can be intentionally temporary or pilots of potentially permanent change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17352.536s">uh</a> applications and the reason why I brought this up tonight Mr. President applications are being accepted as of June 22nd on a first come first serve basis to September 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17364.12s">I</a> would ask Mr. President that we take a vote to ask the city administration to expedite and apply for this particular grant <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17373.763s">for</a> Shared Streets and Spaces Grant, Mr. President, in the interest of outdoor dining, and also in the interest, Mr. President, in assisting those small establishments that may not have the capacity, Mr. President, to make outdoor dining a reality, and this would definitely help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17395.574s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17537.87s">Mr.</a> President, I hate to say during this night that I shirked my duties on these particular records, and I would ask for one more week for review, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17547.517s">Motion</a> to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17548.738s">On</a> the motion to table the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17550.239s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_zUQub31GJNs/2024-11-19_zUQub31GJNs.html">City Council 06-16-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=943.01s">Mr.</a> President, also to clarify, the 6 point whatever it was, 2 or 3 million that the mayor did say she was going to take out of free cash does not change any of the circumstances which are currently taking place right now, which are the cuts within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=960.101s">and</a> the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=961.481s">So</a> anything else that happens would be in addition to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=965.342s">So</a> I think we've got to be mindful that six million brings us to where we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=970.504s">And</a> many of us want to go further than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=973.064s">But,</a> you know, we're going to have to wait and see. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=976.485s">I</a> think it is a wait and see game right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=978.506s">And</a> I've been saying that for the last month and a half regarding local receipts and regarding, you know, hopefully some type of bailout and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=988.608s">So</a> that's my hope, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=990.469s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1068.386s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1070.047s">If</a> I could, Mr. President, I know where Councilor Caraviello, Vice President Caraviello is coming from with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1077.79s">We</a> were told a couple of weeks ago that the mayor was committing, I think it was 6.2 or 6.5 million from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1085.393s">So</a> I'm not quite sure what this resolution does. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1089.094s">Only</a> the mayor can appropriate <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1091.215s">The</a> council could not appropriate we can make recommendations So i'm not quite sure if this is just a feel-good type thing Um, and even then it doesn't feel good because the cuts are still taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1102.462s">Um,</a> so I'm not i'm not quite sure what this actually does.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1318.902s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1321.644s">Just</a> so you know, to some of us, Thursday afternoon is the same as Thursday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1326.766s">That</a> happened to be working. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1329.988s">So</a> it's not much of a difference to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1332.129s">That's</a> still late in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1334.45s">I</a> appreciate you've been, of all people, you've been pushing for this for so long, but it really gives us very little time and such a pressing budget to take a look at it Thursday night and then Saturday morning, early Saturday morning.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1407.98s">So</a> when will the budget book be available for the general public? <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1411.283s">That's</a> another good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1412.144s">I</a> assume when we get it on Thursday, that an electronic copy would go as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1432.525s">If</a> it's not the case, Mr. President, it's incumbent upon us not to have the meeting on Saturday because I don't think it's fair if we're the only ones that have access to a budget book and then we're inviting the general public to participate and they have no access to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1450.386s">So</a> that's not fair either. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1451.467s">So</a> I would say this should be a wait and see, Mr. President, before we set up the date, because that budget book has to be available to everyone in the community, as well as the council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2015.345s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2016.486s">Question,</a> Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2017.607s">Yes,</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2020.368s">This</a> is kind of new to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2022.469s">Have</a> we done this in the past?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2036.482s">So</a> it does sound unique, and that's why, because it was never presented to us.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2112.334s">Before</a> we do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2118.468s">That's</a> all, Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2119.769s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Pruitt. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2120.429s">While</a> we're under suspension, I just want to give my colleagues an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2124.031s">About</a> four or five weeks ago, I presented to the council, which was unanimously supported regarding the intersection of Salton Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2133.296s">And</a> during my presentation, I mentioned that I was waiting to get <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2137.238s">feedback</a> from Chief Buckley regarding the number of accidents at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2142.1s">And</a> if you would indulge me for about 30 seconds, I just want to give you the update to the members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2150.743s">Chief</a> Buckley looked at two areas of significance that was shown on the accident map, one being Maine and Salt Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2161.247s">and</a> the other being the surrounding area around Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2166.231s">Between</a> the year of 2017 and 2020, there were 139 accidents reported at the area of Main and Salt Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2170.735s">And</a> at Wellington Circle, between that same period, there were 202 accidents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2184.487s">Um,</a> and as you can imagine wellington has many feeder roads that go into wellington circle as well as several routes that run through wellington circle And if you notice the number of accidents, uh, very close in nature, mr President and I think it uh speaks volumes to what we need to do at the corner of salt and maine um, and I just wanted to Uh present that information to my colleagues and I appreciate for you indulging me
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2656.355s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2657.853s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2658.874s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2661.715s">What</a> Councilor Knight just mentioned about Brian sums it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2665.477s">He</a> kept our infrastructure going. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2668.018s">Think</a> about it, a system that's 150 years old with pipes that are actually made out of wood, some of our old water pipes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2678.763s">He</a> was a man that kept the infrastructure going, never questioned his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2684.306s">When</a> there was a leak at two in the morning, three in the <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2688.404s">You'd</a> see Brian Rabbit's head hanging out of the hole in the middle of the street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2693.025s">That</a> was the type of dedication he had. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2696.266s">And</a> then, Mr. President, you had someone that fought an illness, a devastating illness, for many years and never said, woe is me, always had a smile, a good word to say, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2710.03s">I</a> thank my colleagues for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2712.031s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2860.696s">Mr.</a> President, if we could dedicate this meeting in the memory of Brian Rabbit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2866.821s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2867.621s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3394.179s">He's</a> gone from the chat, hang on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3395.499s">Can</a> we table it until he comes back, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3397.82s">I</a> mean- He's in the waiting room.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3527.988s">Mr.</a> President, just to follow up, I want to thank President Falco for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3534.771s">I</a> just want to reiterate, Mr. President, there is $50,000 currently available in a city account. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3543.834s">for</a> each business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3546.136s">The</a> only business district that has gotten together and put together a full plan and is now realizing some of the benefits to the 50,000 is the West Medford Business Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3558.463s">So</a> I would ask Mr. President that all the other business associations get together, put together a plan, and Mayor Lungo-Koehn wants to make sure that this <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3568.628s">money</a> that's been available for, I think, close to four years now, gets dispersed so we can do some of the improvements that President Falco just spoke about.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3590.269s">I've</a> been told otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3592.37s">That</a> may have been part of it, but I've been told that they used their portion of their money from the parking program.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4053.921s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4055.462s">I</a> want to thank President Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4057.203s">He</a> did an excellent job explaining that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4059.824s">I,</a> too, want to thank Representative Donato, who immediately got on the phone and talked to representatives of the MBTA, who did assure him, I was told, within the next two or three weeks that it would be fully reinstalled, the bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4078.753s">As</a> President Falco mentioned, that has been a bone of contention with <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4083.615s">area</a> residents that take the express bus, Mr. President, into town. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4088.337s">And</a> I think we all can remember when they try to cut back a few of the routes and the bus was filled to capacity, over which is a requirement <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4100.101s">that</a> the MBTA has for safety concerns, and they still allowed it to exist until the members of the Medford City Council got involved, Mr. President, and we were able to reinstitute some of the cut routes for the 325 and 326. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4116.165s">So</a> I'm hoping within the next two or three weeks, according to Rep Donato, this will be reinstituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4124.527s">because</a> there's a need, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4127.009s">And</a> it clearly shows that there is a need in this community to use both the 325 and the 326. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4137.077s">And</a> I want to thank President Falco for offering this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4140.8s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4141.04s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Bax.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4343.457s">Motion</a> for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4915.255s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4917.362s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the previous speaker for coming and giving his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4924.684s">Mr.</a> President, I think as I stated, I think it was last week, we have more in common than we do when it comes to what we believe needs to be done in regards to police reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4938.808s">I've</a> had the opportunity over the last two weeks, actually, maybe even longer, to speak with some of the police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4945.454s">And</a> a few things that they mentioned to me, I think most people may even find a little surprising. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4951.939s">I</a> think there's a lot of support among police officers regarding civilian review boards, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4958.484s">And</a> with the one caveat that if you do set up a board that it be <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4965.83s">manned</a> with people that have a working knowledge of how a police department operates, the role of a police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4973.692s">So</a> they are open to that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4977.073s">The</a> union, according to Harold McGillivray, has met with the administration and wants to implement cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4985.375s">for</a> not only the safety of the general public, but for the safety of the officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4990.038s">So</a> that's another thing, Mr. President, I think that if we start talking reform, that I think we have more in common, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4998.864s">The</a> last point I'd like to make, and I said this last week, and I think there's a lot of support for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5006.61s">We</a> rely on our police department for almost everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5010.332s">You</a> know, they're the only department open seven days a week, 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5016.196s">So</a> when something happens in the community, Mr. President, you know, and it's after five o'clock, we just don't say, well, you know what, we'll handle it tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5024.481s">It's</a> the police department that responds. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5027.303s">And</a> we're asking the men and women of our police department, Mr. President, to respond to issues of domestic violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5034.868s">We're</a> asking them to respond to drug issues and people that are ODing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5039.671s">We're</a> asking them to respond to mental health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5042.953s">We're</a> asking them to respond to social issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5047.016s">And</a> in my opinion, we're asking them to do a lot in addition to what their main responsibility is, is to keep public order and to prevent crimes and to protect the life and liberty of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5064.164s">They</a> have a lot on their plate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5066.805s">And</a> from what I'm hearing from people when they talk about cutting the police department or defunding the police department, I think it has very many meanings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5078.131s">And</a> from what I'm hearing from a lot of people is they don't necessarily want to cut the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5082.994s">They</a> want to give the assistance they believe the police officers should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5087.816s">So</a> if there's a call, Mr. President, regarding domestic violence, <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5091.858s">Why</a> not have someone that's a domestic violence specialist, Mr. President, on hand that can go to calls, Mr. President, that can attend calls, that can assist? <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5102.546s">Why</a> not have someone that's a social worker that can attend calls, Mr. President, that may require that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5108.51s">Or</a> someone that has a mental health background <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5111.172s">if</a> the issue requires mental health, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5114.513s">There's</a> a lot of ways we can assist the police department, Mr. President, and provide the safety, which I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5121.154s">You</a> know, we may have issues that are happening in the community that require other expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5126.995s">And</a> why not have the availability, Mr. President, and the availability to de-escalate situations? <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5135.016s">And</a> so I think there's a lot more in common than we realize <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5139.957s">I</a> think there would be a lot more support out there, Mr. President, once these discussions are had. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5145.341s">And</a> I think we're going to move towards police reform that's going to be acceptable to everyone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5151.586s">It'll</a> be a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5153.167s">And</a> I think that will not only improve communications within our community, but it'll also assist the brave men and women in our police department, Mr. President, to do their very taxing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5165.273s">And,</a> you know, I think we all want to arrive at the same results, Mr. President, and that is to provide a safe community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5173.658s">That's</a> the number one job of the Medford City Council, is to provide a safe community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5179.861s">And</a> without public safety, we have nothing else in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5184.124s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5185.565s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5186.545s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5716.546s">Mr.</a> President, I didn't have a chance to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5718.648s">I</a> would ask that they lay on the table.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_opOzyZvPRK0/2024-11-19_opOzyZvPRK0.html">City Council 06-09-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=205.536s">Topic</a> is not something we cannot run from. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=207.736s">It's</a> something we need to address and embrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=211.317s">And</a> you have our commitment to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=214.378s">Respectfully</a> signed by Councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=216.453s">Caraviello,</a> Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpelli, and Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=221.255s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=222.376s">Thank</a> you Councilor for your comments.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=359.436s">I'm</a> also going to suspend the remainder of the reading and have the petitioner give a brief synopsis, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=696.278s">Any</a> other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=701.277s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=702.298s">This</a> is more of a general statement and no reflection on National Grid, although they sometimes are part of the problem in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=713.342s">But</a> of recent, I've been receiving a number of complaints regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=717.463s">utility</a> work on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=720.105s">Just</a> recently, Park Street had some utility work and a giant trench was dug the length of Park Street, and the work to put back the tar was less than shoddy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=733.028s">and</a> poses a safety concern for area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=736.269s">I</a> would ask, Mr. President, at some point, I know we have a lot on our plate, but at some point that we set up a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss utility work in the community so we can address and make sure that when utility companies come in, that they restore our streets better than they were, Mr. President, and that no safety concerns exist while work takes place.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=791.41s">I</a> don't want to do it on their petition, so I would just put in a request to the Council President to kindly set up a meeting regarding utility work in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=803.374s">Thank</a> you for clarifying, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=804.495s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=931.519s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=931.759s">So,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=933.82s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=935.541s">I</a> just want to concur with my colleague, Councilor Knight, that that is a great suggestion and much of the work involves trenching and digging in our community and sweeping up after, I think should be a standard part of the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=948.925s">So</a> I support that in future requests, Mr. President, as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1534.022s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1535.662s">The</a> question I had was regarding how would you treat medical waste?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1596.765s">So</a> at no time would you be using the local trash for needles or blood or any other type of medical waste?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1608.637s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1609.458s">Mr.</a> President, my good luck of being on the council for a number of years gives me some wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1615.867s">And</a> back so many years ago, we had a tattoo pile that tried to come onto Forest Street across from the Boys and Girls Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1623.957s">It</a> was called Lucky Tattoos. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1626.16s">And</a> at the time, Mr. President, the petitioners had, in my opinion, a lengthy record about border health issues and so forth and raised some concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1640.093s">And</a> I <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1642.135s">Voted</a> against the petition based on concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1645.177s">I</a> had with lucky tattoo. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1646.457s">This</a> has nothing to do with this petitioner and We mr. President ended up getting sued by lucky tattoo and they ended up winning a suit of I believe it was 25 to $30,000 against the city of method because we denied their special permit and <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1667.207s">and</a> apparently we were being arbitrary and capricious, even though I felt we had valid concerns of this opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1676.409s">On</a> this particular petitioner, Mr. President, I don't have those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1680.429s">It</a> is signed off by the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1682.39s">The</a> Method Police has issued a statement saying that they have no public safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1688.551s">The</a> petitioner seems to be a good business person, and I wish him well, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1696.94s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1729.718s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1731.679s">Council</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1733.42s">I</a> would also ask similar to many other special permit requests that we put a six month review on this special permit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1742.224s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1987.031s">Mr.</a> President, just a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1992.814s">Is</a> it possible to table this till the end of the meeting?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2276.009s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2277.43s">Just</a> a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2278.531s">I</a> think the paper was offered under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2282.133s">I</a> still think we have to do something with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2286.833s">Right,</a> whether we receive it on file or do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2290.536s">Motion</a> to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2291.857s">Motion</a> to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2292.698s">Rule</a> the paper out of order.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2846.474s">Thank</a> you, Council of Affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2847.475s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2849.376s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2851.257s">I</a> think if we all recall, this may have gave us a commitment that we were going to get the budget in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2858.742s">That</a> would have been the earliest budget, Mr. President, I've been on 20 years on the council, that this council has ever received a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2866.527s">And</a> then we had what we all know COVID-19 came into effect, Mr. President, and threw a monkey wrench into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2873.172s">So</a> the commitment was out there, Mr. President, to get us an early budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2877.374s">And</a> we're faced now with a $10 million deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2881.657s">And</a> although some would like to see a budget immediately, I think it's only prudent that the mayor take the time, Mr. President, to wait to see the local aid, what we're going to receive, to see what local receipts may be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2895.447s">We</a> also waited, Mr. President, which we all know, because they extended the period to pay your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2901.511s">So</a> we wanted to see what revenue we had in order to put together a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2906.494s">So</a> I appreciate the fact that my colleagues have concern, but I can tell you from experience, Mr. President, I remember getting the budget with one night to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2918.527s">And</a> I remember, Mr. President, in the past, there wasn't much outcry for many years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2926.814s">And</a> now all of a sudden, in the middle of COVID-19, there's an outcry to get the budget, which we never got this early, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2934.441s">So</a> it's great people want to see the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2937.263s">I'm</a> eager to see the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2938.664s">We</a> need to move forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2940.986s">But</a> by no stretch of the imagination is this city administration holding <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2945.93s">anything</a> back. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2946.952s">They're</a> trying to put together a budget that will provide city services, that will keep people employed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2953.981s">The</a> last thing we want to do is send out a budget to alarm people that they may be losing their job, and then we get a federal stimulus. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2962.433s">or</a> we get a bailout. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2963.694s">And</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2964.655s">When</a> you were worried about your job for the last three weeks, you don't have to worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2968.379s">The</a> last thing we do is want to worry people, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2971.442s">We're</a> all going to have ample time to meet with the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2974.405s">We're</a> going to have ample time to go over the budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2977.488s">And</a> we're going to have ample time to make sure we have input. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2980.849s">So</a> don't let anyone tell you otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2982.869s">The</a> process has worked this way, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2985.79s">And</a> I feel comfortable that we're moving forward with a realistic budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2990.131s">I</a> don't want to see a budget that's not realistic, because I've dealt with one for the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2994.772s">I</a> want to see a realistic budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2996.433s">And</a> I think that's what this current administration is working on, Mr. President, in a time of emergency, in a time of a pandemic, and a lot more happening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3006.215s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3045.196s">Mr.</a> President, that was a preliminary budget that every mayor for the last 30 years works on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3056.523s">And</a> if someone wants to create the budget, maybe they should run for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3060.226s">Because</a> it's the mayor's responsibility to create the budget and then pass it on to the council, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3066.891s">So</a> I don't know why we're putting the cop before the horse, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3071.575s">It's</a> never happened in previous years, and there was never anyone outspoken in previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3076.519s">But</a> now, I guess in COVID-19, we have different expectations, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7548.859s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7553.617s">I</a> just want to state because, you know, I'm actually here tonight to listen more than I do speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7559.82s">But</a> I think this is far too important of an issue to not attack it on many fronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7566.524s">So</a> I'm not opposed to putting out a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7569.285s">I'm</a> not opposed to getting together, as Councilor Scarpelli said, in trying to move issue items forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7575.709s">I</a> think we have to attack this head on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7578.69s">As</a> we heard, this systemic racism has existed for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7585.291s">So</a> don't believe for one second we can take one approach to solve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7589.332s">We</a> have to take many different approaches, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7592.213s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, am willing to do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7595.653s">So</a> tonight, because I'm not saying a lot, I wanted to listen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7599.914s">I</a> think it's important to listen to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7602.695s">I</a> attended the rally, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7605.035s">And</a> as my council colleagues state, I realize there's a lot of anger out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7610.037s">But</a> you have to remember, I represent this whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7613.439s">When</a> someone reaches out to me with a concern, I don't ask them what their ethnicity is. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7617.78s">I</a> don't ask them what their religion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7619.641s">I</a> help everyone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7621.722s">So</a> I would hope that members of the general public realize that we're here to assist, we're here to help, and I don't think there's anyone behind the reel, the seven of us, that don't want to see change in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7636.553s">And</a> I, for one, agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7640.134s">I</a> like to see action. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7641.815s">And</a> I'm not saying a statement's not bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7643.475s">I</a> agree with the statement that was made by both Councilor Bears and Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7647.056s">I</a> agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7648.357s">But</a> I also like to see action. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7650.397s">I</a> want to see action happen in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7653.798s">You</a> know, this is a long point of information, but I'll wait, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7658.58s">But</a> I did want to mention, because I'd say 90% of the emails I got were relative to defunding the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7666.453s">And</a> I think at some point, no one wants to talk about it, but at some point that discussion needs to be had, Mr. President, because I've talked to members of the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7675.237s">I've</a> talked to members of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7677.438s">And</a> I, you know, in my opinion, I think the general public and the police department share a lot of common concerns and a lot of issues that I hear people raise about maybe the police department has too much on their plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7690.345s">Maybe</a> the police department shouldn't be domestic violence specialists. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7693.586s">Maybe</a> they shouldn't be drug Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7695.387s">Maybe</a> they should be mental health Councilors, social workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7698.927s">Um,</a> and those are the issues I think, you know, that we can have common ground and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7704.669s">Maybe</a> we have to look at funding stuff outside of the police budget to assist with issues, Mr. President, that we're hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7712.851s">I</a> think there's a lot of common ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7714.651s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7715.812s">But</a> I don't want to get bogged down in the weeds of us against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7719.353s">And,</a> you know, I, you know, I ran for office to help Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7723.774s">And</a> if people see otherwise, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7725.874s">Everyone's</a> entitled to their opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7727.947s">But</a> I think all of us have the same intent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7730.809s">We</a> want to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7732.53s">And</a> I think getting back and forth with semantics and so forth, I think it doesn't do the conversation just, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7739.595s">So</a> I just want to add that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7742.758s">I'm</a> here for the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7744.239s">I'm</a> here to assist and help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7746.38s">But</a> I'm also here to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7748.221s">God</a> gave me two ears and one mouth for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7750.623s">Do</a> twice as much listening, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=8762.108s">That's</a> going to be a separate resolution.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=8951.657s">I</a> believe Councilor Scott Peli alluded to it, but I just want to confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=8955.92s">This</a> meeting is also going to be a meeting open to the general public, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9885.455s">Any</a> comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9886.056s">Any</a> comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9887.296s">Mr.</a> President, if we could, we have Alicia with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9889.558s">If</a> she could just give a short presentation on it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9894.061s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9895.462s">Alicia.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9925.659s">Mr.</a> President, does this include repeaters and other issues that the fire department had concerns about communication citywide?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9944.718s">So,</a> do you know, Alicia, and you may not know, but do you know where we stand with the repeaters? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9949.78s">Because</a> that was a major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9952.121s">You</a> know, we can have all the updates to radios, but without the repeaters that actually forwards the message, communications fail in the community, which is a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9964.667s">So</a> I want to make sure that that's addressed as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9979.495s">If,</a> if I'm going to support the paper tonight, but if you could just double check with the chief regarding the repeaters, a longstanding issue for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9989.521s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9991.042s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9991.382s">Any</a> other questions from the council?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=10026.813s">Mr.</a> President, I think Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=10031.315s">That's</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=10031.936s">I</a> think it just came up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=10033.016s">I</a> see it at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=10033.857s">Here</a> we go.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=12879.912s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=12881.012s">I</a> didn't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=12882.013s">Can</a> you repeat that, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=12884.654s">What</a> part? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=12886.174s">The</a> whole thing, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=12989.167s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. President, if we can refer to KP before our second reading KP law.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13073.502s">So</a> we can make the change after that, then.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13247.592s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13248.672s">Motion</a> to adjourn, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13250.194s">There</a> is a meeting to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13253.153s">This</a> one.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_zC2BsNwhExU/2024-11-19_zC2BsNwhExU.html">City Council 06-02-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=568.971s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=570.132s">And</a> I want to thank Alicia and Mr. Kerens for being on the call tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=576.456s">These</a> are all, in my opinion, very worthy projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=580.058s">Anyone</a> that's been on the council for a number of years knows Bowen Ave in that area has been a real concern for flooding over many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=588.883s">When</a> there's heavy rains, you better take your canoe out to traverse some of those streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=594.066s">That's</a> how bad it gets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=594.987s">That's</a> no exaggeration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=596.788s">And</a> the homeowners have been putting up with this for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=600.65s">And</a> I hope this study leads to improvements to drainage and other infrastructure improvements in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=608.953s">The</a> water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=610.554s">My</a> question, I was on the council when we voted for water meters back in 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=616.236s">So</a> I remember the nightmare prior to 2005 when we had a system that we used to estimate probably half the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=624.68s">And</a> as you know, when you get an estimated bill, it's not a true rendering of what you use for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=630.745s">And</a> you can imagine people paying bills for consumption that they didn't use. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=636.35s">So</a> it was a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=637.671s">There</a> were a lot of abatements going on at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=642.876s">And</a> it was just a real bad time for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=647.219s">Brian,</a> what is the life expectancy of the current meters that were put in 2005?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=701.162s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=702.203s">This</a> may not, this may be a question for Ron in the water department, but I'm going to ask it anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=709.088s">What,</a> what percent right now are we estimating, if any?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=734.528s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=735.068s">And</a> the plan for this money is not to start going around and systematically replace everyone's meter, which they're now 15 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=744.17s">It's</a> just to have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=745.571s">So</a> if a meter does start to malfunction, you're going to have the ability to replace the head or replace the entire meter.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=774.803s">So,</a> uh, Mr. President, if I could, uh, just, um, uh, amend this if I could, or, uh, have a request to the city administration that we get an update on, uh, the, uh, re-metering. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=790.62s">We're</a> 15 years into a life expectancy of roughly 10 to 11 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=795.022s">And</a> we definitely don't want to go back to the days where we were estimating half our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=803.085s">It</a> created a lot of problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=805.626s">There</a> were residents that were over and underpaying. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=807.927s">There</a> were residents that were getting catch up bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=811.768s">If</a> councilors remember of two, three, four, $5,000, a catch up bill that the city finally figured out that the resident wasn't paying enough over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=823.072s">And</a> we definitely don't want to go back to that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=826.413s">So</a> I would ask that we look at the remediary of the city, Mr. President, which is a larger endeavor, but I think something we should be proactive about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=836.857s">And</a> my last question to Mr. Cairns is, I think all these particular uses, hydrant and so forth, are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=845.383s">I</a> have to put in a plug for catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=848.064s">I</a> still see, Brian, I don't have to tell you this, I don't preach it to the choir, there are still hundreds of catch basins around the city that are sunken in and pose a danger to residents and also are not serving as the function that they're supposed to, to cut off rain, runoff water, because they're sunk in and they're not doing their purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=870.956s">They're</a> not capturing this water and cutting it out to the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=874.718s">So</a> I need to put a plug in for some additional funding for catch basin maintenance, repair, and replacement, as well as this paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=885.903s">So</a> I would offer those two suggestions that the administration report back on a meter replacement plan, and also what the plan is for repairing or replacing our catch basins that currently exist are ones that are broken and caving in throughout the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=945.622s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=945.982s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1526.339s">Excuse</a> me?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2317.055s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2318.176s">This</a> is great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2320.778s">Finally,</a> I think we see some positive results from many thousands of complaints filed by Medford residents regarding airplane noise that started back in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2335.988s">when</a> Massport implemented a flight patent that unfairly and disproportionately pushed and exposed Method residents to noise from runway 33L. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2348.421s">And</a> that's been a bone of contention, not just with the city of Medford, but many surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2354.267s">And</a> it was over the last couple of years that I believe Medford took some great steps under the leadership of former Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2363.569s">There</a> was efforts to join with surrounding communities, of which we joined with Arlington, Somerville, Belmont, Watertown, requesting the FAA study, the changes that were identified in the MIT study that was commissioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2380.393s">And</a> I know under the leadership now of current mayor, Lungo-Koehn, we are seeing results, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2389.139s">The</a> FAA recently said that they will look at the MIT study. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2395.684s">And</a> it'll take about two to three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2398.446s">And</a> they will make recommendations based on <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2403.83s">the</a> study of the MIT, and they are committed to looking and making changes on behalf of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2414.957s">I</a> personally want to thank Mr. President again, because I've been around, I remember the days that we didn't have a representative that sat on this advisory commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2426.405s">So</a> when they were making decisions back in 2013, and even prior to that, Method was not at the table to stand up and say, wait a minute, you're using Method as a dumping ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2439.161s">And</a> I'm proud to say, Mr. President, I raised the red flag and I got a copy of the minutes back some eight years ago, and I showed the general public how we had no one representing our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2452.246s">And</a> I have to say it was Mayor McGlynn at the time, chose to put two representatives on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2458.908s">It</a> was Peter Houck and Luke Presner, and they've done yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2463.63s">in</a> representing our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2466.212s">If</a> you've ever been to one of their presentations, they are extremely knowledgeable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2472.017s">I</a> have people from surrounding communities that would like to steal them and say, how can we get them to represent our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2479.203s">That's</a> how great they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2481.224s">I</a> would only ask, Mr. President, that we be kept up to date on this June meeting that's going to take place with Massport Community Advisory Committee members, as well as the FAA. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2492.553s">and</a> that they appear at a future council meeting to give us an update to what direction we are going to move in as a community and if any resources or other things are needed that they'd be able to present that to the council, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2510.046s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2511.167s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2512.208s">Vice</a> President Caraviello.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3240.253s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3241.173s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3243.834s">He</a> brings a lot of valid points up regarding much-needed affordable housing, which I think we all can agree upon, additional revenue from building permits and so forth, which I think we all agree upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3257.76s">I</a> think the one issue, Mr. President, we do have to look at is that the fact that this law has been around for five decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3267.483s">And</a> if you look at the statistics, 80% of the communities in Massachusetts fall below the 10% threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3275.209s">So</a> even though this law has been out there for five decades, it's done very little to add affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3282.153s">And</a> I agree with my colleagues, I agree with Councilor Knight said, I think a friendly 40B is something we should be looking at as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3290.259s">I</a> also think there are housing production plans that, within the last two years, 150 cities and towns have taken advantage of, which is a way of creating a blueprint in a community that allows you to move forward on these larger projects that have affordability components. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3308.763s">And</a> those are less contentious. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3311.324s">They're</a> good ways of moving forward with developers and suiting the needs of a community, but also not rolling over either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3320.226s">Because,</a> you know, if we talk about fairness, let's face it, these particular projects, a thousand units are within a square mile of each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3331.085s">They're</a> not spread around the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3334.127s">I</a> could just tell you, Mr. President, in my neighborhood alone, they've added hundreds, if not thousands of units in the last year and a half in one neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3345.414s">So</a> I think when we have to take a look at this, and maybe when we start looking at zoning, this will be an issue we do take a look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3352.698s">But</a> we have to make sure that if we're going to create these projects, especially these larger projects, that they're created fairly and evenly distributed around the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3363.625s">I</a> think that's vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3365.086s">And</a> those are things that I think we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3367.028s">So</a> I don't fault the administration for standing up on behalf of the community and saying, these are mitigating factors we're going to be looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3375.253s">These</a> are things that we want to safeguard neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3377.915s">These</a> are issues that we're concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3379.776s">I</a> don't fault them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3381.157s">But</a> I would like to see a collaborative effort when the developers do come in so we can work on this and not waste money with attorneys. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3389.829s">Because</a> the only one that gains are the attorneys making money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3393.214s">And</a> so I'd like to see a collaborative effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3396.538s">when</a> this happens, and I'd like to see a little more thought, Mr. President, to make sure that these projects are equally dispersed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3403.503s">Why</a> should one neighborhood experience thousands of more traffic trips and thousands of more cars on the street while other neighborhoods don't see anything at all, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3412.87s">So,</a> you know, if we're going to stand up and talk about fairness, we have to have the discussion, although it may be painful because people don't want to talk about it, Mr. President, but it's something that we need to discuss as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3425.14s">And</a> I thank my colleagues for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3428.863s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3431.445s">Councilor</a> Peers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4430.004s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4430.845s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4435.156s">It's</a> my understanding that this would only apply during the COVID emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4441.643s">And</a> once that's lifted, this would no longer apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4445.007s">So</a> I just want to make sure that's on record and my colleagues are aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4450.193s">And</a> secondly, Mr. President, what actually troubles me more <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4454.417s">than</a> the exorbitant fees that they're charging, to be quite honest with you, is the fact that many of these small business owners have opted to offer discounts if you call them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4466.98s">And</a> because Grubhub and DoorDash and Uber Eats has such a market power, that they're able to prevent the restaurants from offering their own incentive for people to call them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4480.407s">and</a> at a discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4482.789s">So</a> they really have cornered the market, Mr. President, especially now with COVID and the need for delivery and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4492.157s">And</a> I think anything we can do to help the small business at least get through this timeframe, I think is warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4500.424s">So</a> I will support this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4503.506s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4504.627s">Councilor</a> Bears.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5411.207s">No,</a> Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5413.17s">Oh,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5414.731s">Mr.</a> President, you know, this has been a long process, you know, and I think we're all proud, I think I speak for everyone, of the end results of many, many months and years of hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5432.051s">And</a> I want to personally thank where this all started, which was the Zoning Subcommittee, and it was led by Vice President Caraviello with members Scarpelli and Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5443.948s">They</a> did yeoman's work putting together a document that was <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5447.232s">really</a> complex and a lot of moving parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5450.714s">And</a> I think we came out with a document that fits this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5456.297s">This</a> is not a cookie cutter document. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5458.959s">This</a> is unique to the city of Medford and how it applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5463.141s">And</a> I think it works well within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5466.263s">It</a> allows establishments to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5469.205s">It</a> allows them to flourish. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5471.466s">And</a> it also addresses the will of the general public, <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5475.308s">voted</a> a majority to allow marijuana shops within the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5481.194s">So</a> I want to thank your leadership, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5484.177s">I</a> know this got a little contentious with some of the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5487.08s">You</a> kept us on path, and I think we came out with a document that really I feel very comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5495.728s">And</a> I just want to thank my colleagues.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5662.291s">Yes,</a> before you call the roll, <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5665.165s">Before</a> you call the roll, we have a very important meeting this Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5669.608s">And</a> maybe you want to reiterate that to the general public regarding the financial of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5676.773s">And</a> we'll be meeting with our outside auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=5679.495s">Maybe</a> you want to let the general public know that.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1226.597s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1227.418s">I</a> want to thank Vice President Caraviello for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1230.3s">90</a> years young, May Makibrek, what an accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1234.744s">You</a> know, I had the unique opportunity to serve on the Methodist Council, incorporated with May on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1243.291s">Talking</a> about someone that's a plugger, a go-getter, never took no for an answer, and truly was unselfish when it came to never wanting the recognition, just wanting to get things done in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1256.001s">If</a> it wasn't for May, you could safely say the Boys and Girls Club would not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1260.802s">If</a> it wasn't for May, the Friends of Chevalier wouldn't be supporting the Chevalier Auditorium for the many, many years and all the improvements that were done to Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1272.405s">You</a> know, May has been instrumental in this community and continues to be instrumental in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1278.387s">And</a> I just want to personally <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1280.387s">congratulator</a> and wish her another hundred years of community involvement in this community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1367.774s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1369.236s">I</a> rise once again with my fellow colleagues to bring up the concern of public safety, in particular at the corner of Main Street and South Street and along the entirety of South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1385.01s">Last</a> we spoke, Mr. President, I think it was a couple of months ago, we brought up this issue regarding some of the traffic calming initiatives that were pushed forward during a public meeting that hundreds of residents in the area attended, and of which many of the initiatives that were sent to the Traffic Commission have yet to be done, Mr. President, which is a little alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1410.818s">Also,</a> Mr. President, within the last couple of months, and I have talked to Chief Buckley just recently, and I'm in the process of getting the traffic accidents in that particular area from the chief, an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1424.204s">There</a> has been several major traffic accidents on that particular corner in the last couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1432.308s">So</a> this is an issue that's not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1435.35s">It's</a> existed for, I'd have to say since I've been on the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1442.191s">So</a> 20 years, Mr. President, we've been asking for some relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1446.354s">As</a> we all know, that section of the corner of Main and South is a state road, and they have jurisdiction over that particular piece of road that we are discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1458.363s">So</a> what I did, Mr. President, I went through some of the studies that were initiated by this community since 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1469.979s">And</a> I found it pretty interesting that each study that I looked at all spoke about the need for traffic calming and traffic improvements, safety improvements in the Method Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1483.885s">So</a> this has been since 2005, over four reports that I could get my hands on, and I'm sure there were more, Mr. President, all spoke about initiatives that should be done in our community to improve traffic flow, pedestrian, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1499.972s">bicycles,</a> and in my opinion, very little has been acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1506.914s">So</a> the most recent report we have was December 2018, which was the Method Square Priority Roadway Improvement Study. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1516.577s">And</a> that was done by the Boston Regional Metropolitan Planning Organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1521.668s">And</a> that was commissioned in December, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1523.59s">Uh,</a> they came out with, uh, I don't know if it was a 40, 50 page report, uh, that talked about, uh, the method square surrounding area and ways to make improvements of which, um, I'd like to go through Mr. President, their recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1542.138s">for</a> the Medford Square area, and I'd like to isolate not on all their recommendations, but the intersection of South Street and Main Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1555.108s">So</a> I will get into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1556.649s">The</a> second report that was commissioned by the city was December 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1560.912s">So</a> it was a year before the Medford Square Priority Roadway Improvement Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1567.697s">And</a> that was the Medford Square Master Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1570.411s">And</a> that was done by the Metro Area Planning Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1574.412s">And</a> that had an associated cost of $90,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1576.453s">That</a> also got into the improvements and traffic calming improvements that were needed in the Medford Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1585.857s">I</a> am not going to get into that, Mr. President, because I think much of that is covered in the Medford Square priority roadway improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1593.088s">The</a> report prior to that was in the fall of 2006. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1596.569s">It</a> was the Medford Square and Mystic River Reconnection, Revitalization, and Redevelopment Study. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1603.632s">And</a> that was done by MIT. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1605.973s">And</a> that talked about parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1607.933s">It</a> talked about improvements to the downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1611.354s">It</a> talked about revitalizing business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1613.715s">That</a> encompassed a lot more than just roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1616.756s">However,</a> the roadway in question, Salt Street and Main, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1622.038s">was</a> mentioned, Mr. President, and ways to improve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1624.92s">That</a> was back in 2006. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1627.662s">And</a> the last report I could find was the original Medford Square Master Plan, which was done by Sasaki in June of 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1639.385s">And</a> that had an associated cost of a little over $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1643.269s">And</a> I don't have the cost of the other studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1647.594s">So</a> the two that I have, Mr. President, were close to $200,000 in studies with very little in the way of improvements to our roadways, which <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1661.536s">To</a> me, Mr. President, is alarming when we have to talk about it year after year and know that as time goes by, accidents increase, pedestrian safety is at an all time dangerous rate in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1676.688s">And</a> that should concern all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1680.413s">So</a> December 2018, the Metropolitan Planning Organization conducted this study. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1686.115s">As</a> I mentioned, the study is part of the MPO series of ongoing studies that addresses safety, mobility, and access of the Boston region's priority roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1696.338s">This</a> report identifies specific issues and concerns in Medford Square study area, presents an in-depth analysis of multiple transportation-related factors, and recommends potential short, long-term solutions to problems, including improvement alternatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1715.33s">So</a> the study goes on to talk about 2.4 total miles of needed improvements on our roadways at many different sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1725.198s">I'm</a> just going to focus, Mr. President, on the Main Street, Route 38 from Salem Street to Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1733.044s">And</a> that calls into question, as we all know, the South Street and Main Street connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1740.977s">So</a> Mr. President, in 2000, 2013, and 2015, mass DOT data shows that the crash clusters <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1750.41s">that</a> are present throughout the entire study area, which I just alluded to this five different major study areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1759.094s">They</a> were ranked in the top 5% of crash locations in the Boston region MPO area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1769.278s">So</a> we have five locations in Medford that are in the top 5% of crash clusters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1777.402s">That</a> speaks volumes, Mr. President, and that was indicated within this December 2018 report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1785.884s">It</a> goes on to say, Mr. President, that the Main Street corridor from Craddock Bridge to Mystic Ave, whose two most concerning intersections are Main Street at Route 16 ramps and Main Street at Mystic Ave, which is the area that we're focusing on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1805.068s">The</a> issues of concern <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1807.333s">I</a> know we're all, some of us, this is old hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1811.869s">But</a> I think we've got to keep on revisiting this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1815.21s">I</a> had a talk today with Christine Barber, our state representative, who assured me that there's transportation bond bill money that is for the purpose of putting signalization throughout the square, which was a major recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1830.597s">I</a> think there was an estimated cost, which I brought up several months back at, I want to say, $4 to $5 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1837.7s">which</a> sounds like overkill in my opinion, but that's what they came out with. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1843.765s">But</a> according to Representative Barber, that there is money in the transportation bond bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1851.531s">It</a> just has to be freed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1853.693s">So,</a> issues of concern, there is considerable traffic on Main Street during the a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1858.697s">and</a> p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1859.277s">peak</a> periods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1860.578s">Anyone</a> crossing those streets realize, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, it's a game of chicken or frog. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1868.664s">Frogger</a> trying to cross those streets and even just trying to get out onto Main Street is you're taking your life in your hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1877.172s">The</a> intersection at Main Street Route 16 ramps is currently un-signalized with stop controls at Route 16 westbound off-ramp and South Street joined by Route 16 eastbound off-ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1890.185s">During</a> peak traffic periods, the stop control approaches are extremely congested. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1895.535s">The</a> intersection of Main Street and Mystic Ave currently operates with flashing yellow on Main Street southbound and Mystic Ave flashing red on Main Street northbound during peak periods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1907.458s">Vehicles</a> on Main Street northbound endure extensive delays and frequently force themselves into the intersection, what causes potential conflicts with prevailing traffic and sometimes gridlock. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1919.515s">the</a> intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1921.116s">These</a> two intersections have a crash rate much higher than the district floor average of un-signalized sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1931.02s">So</a> it's ranked in the top 5% and it has a much higher average of crashes than other un-signalized intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1942.478s">With</a> no traffic signals, with pedestrian phases, and under heavy traffic, pedestrians usually have a difficult time crossing the two intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1952.243s">Pedestrian</a> crosswalk markings on Main Street are faded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1957.906s">That</a> was 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1958.266s">They</a> have since painted the crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1961.868s">There</a> are no sufficient shoulders or clearly marked shared road bicycle accommodations on Main Street and Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1972.178s">So</a> the report went on, Mr. President, and the reason why I bring this up is we don't have to recreate the wheel when it comes to what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1981.766s">We</a> have four commission reports by organizations that came in, did a thorough investigation, had community input, public hearings, and made recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=1996.876s">And</a> here we are 15 years later, and we're no closer to addressing our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2003.078s">But</a> yet, accidents continue to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2007.159s">Very</a> serious accidents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2010.64s">So</a> the proposed short-term improvements, and I'll go over them briefly, regularly maintain the crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2017.803s">You</a> would think that would be a no-brainer, but in our community, it's something that has to be revisited every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2024.963s">You</a> know, I asked for thermal plastic crosswalks, which don't need repainting every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2030.23s">They</a> last five years, they're slip resistant, they're highly reflective, and we still don't incorporate that as a common practice in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2040.462s">which</a> it's a little more expensive, but the state uses them and every other large agency and city uses thermoplastic in the use of their pavement markings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2053.249s">Install</a> stripe yield lines in both directions at the crosswalk on Main Street near the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2060.053s">Consider</a> removing on-street parking in front of the police station and providing at least five foot shoulders on both sides <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2066.238s">of</a> Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2067.559s">Install</a> striped sharrows at appropriate locations of both streets south of the intersection of Main Street and Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2075.203s">Support</a> development on South Method Connector, a multi-use path on South Bank of the Mystic River that would connect the Mystic Greenway currently understudied by the City of Method and the Mystic River Watershed Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2090.394s">long-term</a> improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2092.917s">Both</a> the intersection of Main Street at Route 16 ramps and Main Street at Mystic Ave should be signalized and reconstructed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2101.946s">Main</a> Street at Route 16, in summary, this study proposes alternative 1A and 1B for the interchange, long-term improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2114.181s">1A,</a> signalize the two ramp intersections under one controller with three phase traffic operations and concurrent pedestrian phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2124.38s">Now,</a> Mr. President, I need to add that this does not talk about signalization all the way from Salem Street, which we were originally told by the state would run us anywhere from $3 to $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2137.924s">This</a> is far more of a centralized approach to alleviate the concerns we have on the Main Street, South Street area to Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2149.708s">Alternative</a> B, signalize the two ramp intersections under one controller with four-phase traffic operations and concurrent pedestrian phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2162.38s">So,</a> Mr. President, I won't get into all the other improvements, but I do have them and I am going to list them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2170.563s">I</a> would ask that as part of this report, the funding that MassDOT says is clearly available for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2183.038s">And</a> I would ask any of my colleagues to go on to the FY, the 2018 Medford Square Priority Roadway Improvement Study. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2191.222s">And</a> they could see that for themselves that the state is saying funding is available for this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2198.664s">So</a> I don't know why we're in a quandary now, how we're going to pay for this and why we haven't moved forward on this project for at least the last two years since we received this report, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2211.632s">So</a> I would ask that through our traffic engineer and through our engineer that we find out about the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2221.695s">that</a> DOT admits is available to the city of Medford for the Route 16, Mystic Ave portion of improvements that were mentioned within the Priority Roadway Improvement Study of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2240.77s">I</a> would also ask, Mr. President, once again, I think we did this six months ago, and I don't recall a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2247.235s">Maybe</a> my colleagues can correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2249.694s">but</a> the council recommended during a public meeting with hundreds of residents from the South Street area, some simple low-lying fruit of stop signs, widening sidewalks, raised crosswalks, maybe even a pedestrian crossing light on South Street in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2271.885s">And</a> there may have been one or two improvements, but largely, Mr. President, many of the recommendations that were forwarded to the traffic commission have not been acted upon yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2282.433s">And</a> if there's a reason why I, as one member of the council, would like to know, if it's a financial reason, then we should have that discussion with the mayor and try to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2292.119s">We're</a> going to be discussing budget shortly, what needs to be done to move these along. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2297.853s">Uh,</a> we asked for a meeting with our state delegation, uh, regarding, um, improvements to the state roadway, which is at the corner of Maine and, uh, and South street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2311.299s">Uh,</a> I know we met with DOT sometime back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2314.04s">They</a> really took a hotline stance on, uh, you know, more or less saying that they didn't have the funding to do the full signalization from Salem street on down to Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2326.485s">and</a> put that outrageous cost estimate on getting that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2331.847s">So</a> I would ask once again, Mr. President, maybe we need a roundtable summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2336.83s">Maybe</a> we need to bring in someone higher up <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2344.862s">than</a> the representatives we're seeing from DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2347.723s">Maybe</a> we need the commissioner present, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2351.705s">Maybe</a> we need the lieutenant governor present. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2354.987s">This</a> is, to me, an all-time risk right now we face for our residents, for people driving, for people on bicycles, for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2366.652s">And</a> we can no longer sit around, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2369.294s">I</a> think we've all issued our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2372.195s">We</a> can no longer sit around and say, you know what, we're waiting for the state to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2376.941s">I've</a> said it before, many of the state roads in our community, and I feel this strongly, if the state doesn't want to act, we should step forward and act and worry about the ramifications after. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2392.268s">Because</a> these are roads in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2394.669s">And</a> if the state doesn't want to act upon these or feels that it's too expensive, putting a cost on public safety and lives in our community, then we need to step forward, Mr. President, as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2409.858s">And</a> we need to shake the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2413.0s">We</a> need to yell from the highest mountain, whatever it's going to take, Mr. President, to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2419.555s">And</a> we also are locating a public safety building across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2425.161s">What</a> message does that send to residents that may want to go to the public safety building, that may want to walk there? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2432.809s">It</a> sends a lousy message, Mr. President, that you're not welcome unless you drive there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2439.075s">It</a> sends an awful message in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2442.977s">So</a> as soon as I get the results, Mr. President, from the number of accidents at that location that Chief Buckley said they're working on, I will also present that to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2453.901s">I</a> would ask in the form of a motion that the traffic engineer and our city engineer look at the 2018 report and find out why we have not solicited the funding according to what MassDOT said we're eligible, and also that <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2474.678s">They</a> look into the traffic calming initiatives that were pushed forward by a unanimous vote of this council back many months ago, and where we stand with that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2484.945s">And</a> I would respectfully ask you, Mr. President, that we set up a roundtable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2491.02s">with</a> our state delegation, with higher ups from DOT, whoever we can get at the meeting, Mr. President, this is vital on behalf of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2500.509s">And</a> I thank my colleagues for indulging me with that presentation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2542.348s">The</a> second one is to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2544.33s">That</a> was mentioned in the 2018 report as being available.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2574.465s">So</a> just a clarification on the second one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2577.046s">It</a> was at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2578.326s">It</a> was South Street and the intersection of South and Main. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2582.248s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2582.528s">We</a> made a number of improvements requested on South Street itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2587.25s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2588.66s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2590.562s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Clerk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4185.808s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4187.668s">I'm</a> sorry, Councilor Marks, did you have your hand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4192.132s">I</a> may have missed it, but Roberta, did you mention the range of requests for the nine applicants?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4204.315s">So</a> we don't know, you said 45,000 between nine applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4210.217s">So</a> what's the most that someone can receive? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4213.118s">Do</a> we know that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4888.991s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4890.713s">Doug,</a> can you point to anything in particular why the costs, uh, were so exorbitant compared to what was originally thought?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4945.841s">So</a> has this passed through the historic commission in the city?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4964.063s">So</a> they have approved it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4968.905s">If</a> we could just get a notice on that, Mr. President, that this was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4973.227s">Is</a> that typical of CPC funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4976.169s">Is</a> that a requirement before funds are doled out? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4979.55s">Or</a> how does it typically work?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5000.943s">Right,</a> but I'm talking about in particular before the CPC grants money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5005.826s">Did</a> you make sure if there's any type of sign off or approval that that's done prior to allocating money?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7049.68s">Thank</a> you Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7052.591s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7054.592s">Um,</a> Ellen, if you could just reiterate, I think you mentioned it, but the $10,000, uh, amount is imposed by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7061.995s">Is</a> that, is that what that was?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7083.304s">Right,</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7085.344s">And</a> you said there's roughly 1000 businesses that this would apply to?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7098.43s">600</a> would qualify. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7099.81s">Do</a> you have any indication of how many, uh, of, uh, small businesses would be in the range from, uh, $10,001 to $20,000?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7123.515s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7124.187s">You</a> know, the amount of money, it's really negligible for the amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7129.629s">Um,</a> uh, you know, it's really, in my opinion, not a savings to the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7135.111s">I</a> mean, you're talking very minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7137.712s">Um,</a> but, uh, my, my only concern is it's minimal on the other end too, but someone that may have property value that's assessed at $10,050 is going to see an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7151.717s">And</a> I don't know how many of those are out there, but it's minimal anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7157.82s">So</a> is this something that we anticipate gonna happen every year, or is this a one-time thing we're looking at?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7181.884s">But</a> what I'm saying is, will the city administration come back next year and say we'd like to enact this small business exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7190.433s">Is</a> that that's a possibility correct.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7201.977s">Okay,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7203.838s">So</a> this is every year now go moving forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7208.58s">And</a> I okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7215.69s">It's</a> so minimal that I don't have a problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7221.312s">But</a> if you could get us the numbers, I'd be curious to see the other 400 businesses where they fall on personal property tax amounts.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7236.196s">Not</a> the total. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7238.453s">the</a> dollar amount broken down by percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7242.756s">So</a> are you able to tell us what range, how many businesses fall in between 10 to 20,000 or 10 to 50,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7252.141s">I'd</a> be curious to see what that results are from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7258.925s">Is</a> that something you can get? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7260.646s">Certainly,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7262.467s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7524.323s">Mr.</a> President, we have the Chief of Staff, if we can get a brief overview of what they're trying to put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7531.892s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8405.68s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8406.701s">I</a> want to thank Chief of Staff Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8409.982s">It's</a> my understanding, Mr. President, this applies to large-scale projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8415.585s">So</a> I think anyone that's been on the Council for a number of years can recall the Locust Street project and how members of the Council, when we sat down with the developer, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8425.63s">were</a> urging, and I believe Council Vice President Caraviello did the same, we were urging them to add more retail space within the project itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8437.157s">They</a> were strictly looking to put residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8440.079s">And</a> we didn't wanna create these giant housing outlets that had no community feel to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8452.727s">And</a> so I think this is one way of attaching whatever's built. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8457.75s">And</a> I don't think this applies to small mom and pop, two or three family homes and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8463.834s">This</a> is large scale projects that they have some type of community feel to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8468.597s">that,</a> you know, for instance, when we looked at the revitalization of Medford Square, the projects that were sent to us had very little commercial retail space within them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8479.269s">It</a> was all residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8480.97s">So</a> on the east side of Medford Square near City Hall, it kind of created just an area where there was housing and no reason to go, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8491.121s">And</a> that was something that we were looking at as a council saying, you know what, we don't want these large scale projects taking place without that community feeling and without that community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8502.189s">So</a> I welcome this for anyone to think that because we started this process of recodifying that we shouldn't look at anything else for the next year should have their head examined. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8513.517s">Because</a> we should always be looking for low-lying fruit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8517.101s">We</a> should always be looking to take advantage of ways that we may be able to push something forward, Mr. President, and not wait if it's something we can do easily, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8529.495s">To</a> me, this is something worth exploring. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8531.856s">I</a> think it merits, I will support sending it to the community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8537.82s">As</a> anyone knows that's familiar with this, this requires public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8541.862s">So</a> to say that there's no public hearings or public input won't take place is not correct, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8548.385s">There</a> will be ample time for public input, public hearings, business input, and that's the process that we follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8554.969s">So</a> I support this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8558.231s">you</a> know, any way we can improve the process in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8562.84s">And</a> I think this is one way of keeping our commercial base up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8567.815s">which</a> we know once that dwindles, residential taxpayers are going to feel the burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8573.618s">They're</a> going to feel the heat on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8576.6s">And</a> it's up to us to make sure there's a good balance out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8580.022s">And</a> from what I'm seeing, between 40B projects and a number of other initiatives, that we seem to be losing a lot of our commercial base. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8589.067s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, I'm not going to allow that to happen, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_Vqhy8xSBDPs/2024-11-19_Vqhy8xSBDPs.html">City Council 05-19-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=858.153s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=860.156s">It</a> might be appropriate at this point that we have a project update also here, and I appreciate the work Vice President Capiello has done on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=869.345s">He</a> was one of the leaders in moving this library forward and was the person that came out originally and alarmed the city that there was a potential grant out there some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=881.017s">And</a> I think that's why we're in the situation we are now moving forward on a state-of-the-art library. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=886.039s">But</a> I would ask, Mr. President, if we can have a separate meeting, maybe a committee of the whole, where we can have a project update on where we stand with construction and the private foundation, and if we are going to meet our goals.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=904.906s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=906.127s">Second,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1193.403s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1194.543s">In</a> line with this, which I support this resolution wholeheartedly, if we can get an update from our emergency preparedness office regarding what steps have been taken over the last three months, if any. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1208.666s">Councilor</a> Marks, is that an amendment or is it a request? <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1213.047s">Either</a> way, if the councilor doesn't mind, I'll add it to his request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1216.588s">If</a> not, I'll do it as amendment.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1224.538s">Can</a> I have that language back, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1226.019s">I</a> didn't get it all down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1228.001s">That</a> we receive an update from the emergency preparedness office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1233.445s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1236.527s">Regarding</a> what steps, as Councilor Knight mentioned, to safeguard our public safety officials and first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1244.754s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1245.354s">You</a> know, every year, Mr. President, if I could add, <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1248.678s">We</a> fund the emergency preparedness office in the budget, and it's pitiful of the amount of money that we put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1258.548s">I</a> want to say maybe $1,500 for a city this size, maybe $2,000, and I can't remember the exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1268.037s">But</a> it's really next to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1271.079s">And</a> in a time of need that we see now, it really makes you think, how are we prepared to handle issues that we confront as a community? <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1281.645s">And</a> so I think it's important maybe during the budget that we also revisit what's spent for emergency preparedness in our community as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2037.977s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2039.277s">And</a> I too want to thank Representative Donato and Nancy White. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2043.819s">As</a> a former ward chair of Ward 7, I appreciated all the work that they put in over the many years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2053.483s">When</a> the times were tough in the Democratic Party, they kept the Democratic Party going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2060.665s">and</a> for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2062.305s">So</a> I want to thank them for their efforts over the years as the outgoing co-chairs, and I'd like to thank our own Councilor Morell and Henry Millerin as the incoming new Democratic Water and City Committee chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2078.149s">So</a> I want to thank them for their interest, and hopefully we can get the party back on its feet again, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2985.98s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. President, just if we could, you know, now from what I recall, and I think other Councils offered this, a crosswalk at the intersection of Salem and Everett <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=3000.055s">street.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=3000.356s">We've</a> been asking for that for probably close to two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=3004.018s">Another</a> dangerous area on Salem Street, and a crosswalk is warranted in that area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=3010.223s">So</a> if I can further amend it, that a crosswalk once again be placed at the intersection of Salem and Everett Street.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=991.298s">Mr.</a> President, I move suspension of the rules to take paper 20-355, which is on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=998.5s">We</a> have the city engineer here to present regarding safe routes to school project.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2155.471s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2156.812s">And</a> first, I'd like to applaud the Brooks School for, I believe it's been six years for this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2167.42s">And</a> many of the improvements, 99% of them of which I agree with, will do tremendous in traffic calming and making a high street or a portion of high street safer to travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2179.989s">So</a> I do support a big portion of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2184.032s">Tim,</a> I had a question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2185.372s">We</a> talked about easements. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2187.133s">Also,</a> there are several properties that are privately owned that have private property on city property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2195.735s">And</a> I was told by yourself that the state was going to put out an agreement that they weren't going to go after property owners that may have encroached on city property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2208.317s">Could</a> you just give us a little update on that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2374.798s">Okay,</a> so just so I understand then regarding this current project of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2380.002s">Ruth's</a> to school, there will be no property, city resident property that will be taken.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2414.529s">Um,</a> and Mr. President, if I could, I know there, uh, were a number of concerns by, uh, residents, area residents on high street and some of the, uh, budding streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2426.359s">Um,</a> the traffic commission, uh, had a meeting, uh, several months back regarding, uh, the taking of parking spots along high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2435.687s">Uh,</a> so this project can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2437.769s">I</a> know many residents voiced their concern, um, naturally. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2442.734s">Parking</a> is at a premium, and let's face it, no one wants to lose a parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2448.298s">And</a> we as a council voted unanimously, I believe it was several months back, to ask if DOT and the city could get together and see if they can explore some other options where we may be able to save some parking along High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2464.35s">And</a> apparently that didn't bear any fruit, those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2469.893s">However,</a> Mr. President, at the traffic commission meeting, there were several residents that brought up to the traffic commission whether or not they could take a bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2480.695s">And</a> during non-peak time, for instance, 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2484.437s">or</a> 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2484.978s">at</a> night, have it revert to parking, area parking from 7 p.m., 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2493.483s">at</a> night to 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2494.083s">or</a> 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2494.283s">in</a> the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2498.227s">And</a> the traffic commission said they were going to look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2503.59s">I</a> had a discussion today with Chief Buckley, and he reiterated his concerns that, first of all, that DOT made it clear that this project had to have a bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2517.578s">And</a> none of us want to jeopardize a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2521.2s">However,</a> I did ask him if the traffic commission was going to explore <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2526.422s">possibly</a> turning this bike lane for non-peak hours into parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2532.825s">And</a> he said they are going to explore that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2535.186s">So</a> I did get a reassurance from Chief Buckley today that that was under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2541.409s">The</a> second piece I just want to touch upon, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, I received a number of emails from people today in support of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2550.073s">And</a> like I said, 99% of this project I do support. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2554.215s">The</a> one concern I have, Mr. President, which I found a little terrifying in several of the emails I received, is residents saying that they now can have their elementary school child use High Street to bike to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2569.549s">That</a> really concerns me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2573.372s">I'm</a> not one to put a rubber stamp on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2576.034s">And</a> the fact that we may be able to get money for this project is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2580.195s">And</a> the fact that this project has a big public safety component in it is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2585.377s">And</a> the traffic calming component is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2588.058s">The</a> one concern I do have, Mr. President, and I know the city engineer said we have more plans to extend our bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2596.44s">The</a> reason why we were told at the beginning the bike lane was going to be on that side of High Street was <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2601.702s">that</a> it's the safest side because when you have bicyclists traveling, for what we were told, you want them, because they're going at a slower speed, to travel uphill rather than downhill. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2614.807s">And</a> that made it for a safer area and that's why they decided <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2617.888s">to</a> make the bike lane go up High Street rather than down High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2621.671s">That</a> was my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2623.392s">My</a> concern is, Mr. President, if residents feel comfortable now having their child bike to school, especially elementary kids on a very, very busy road on High Street, we have a four-block bike lane that goes up High Street, which is the slow part when you're riding a bike, and all of a sudden it stops at the top by Hastings Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2648.021s">And</a> it goes into the downward slope down High Street and a very winding, dangerous part of High Street, extremely dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2658.434s">And</a> I think we'd all be negligent if we didn't step up and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2665.721s">If</a> we're going to do the bike lane, for the very least, we should extend this, whether it's part of this project or part of the city project, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2675.089s">I,</a> in good conscience, have a tough time saying, OK, we'll accept the money, we'll put the bike lane for four blocks, and no one will be the wiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2683.036s">Because</a> I foresee a problem, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2685.638s">especially</a> if residents think now we're creating a safe zone for children to ride their bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2691.619s">That</a> is not a safe zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2693.839s">And</a> the way it breaks off, Mr. President, if anyone's familiar, at the top of Hastings, then it winds down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2700.621s">That</a> is a very dangerous area to all of a sudden have a bike lane stop, especially for young kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2707.882s">So</a> I'd like, Mr. President, to offer a motion tonight that we as a city, if we're going to move forward with this project,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2725.205s">And</a> I'll leave it up to the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2727.487s">I'll</a> leave it up to the traffic engineer to decide when to get to Winthrop Circle and so forth and let them decide the logistics of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2739.615s">But</a> I can't have in my conscience to leave a bike path just because it's getting funded for four blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2745.519s">We</a> should turn a blind eye as a city and say, well, that's fine with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2750.122s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2750.902s">We're</a> not going to turn down the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2752.603s">We</a> should step up, Mr. President, to the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2756.905s">And</a> if you're talking about spots, there's no loss of parking spots on that point of High Street that winds down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2764.567s">That</a> would be an ideal place to continue the bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2768.047s">And</a> then when we tell parents, we're creating safe routes to school, we're really creating a safe route. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2775.189s">Because</a> four blocks that leads to an area that's a dangerous area is not a safe route, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2782.45s">And</a> so I'm going to offer that tonight as a motion that, you know, I'm going to support this project, but it has to be, Mr. President, that we have our city engineer and we'll ask the mayor, because the mayor presented this paper to us, to give us a commitment that that bike lane will be extended, Mr. President, not in the future, but now as part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2802.299s">And</a> if the city has to pick up the cost, then so be it, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2832.95s">Mr.</a> President, the reason why I say that, I'm not a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2836.353s">I'm</a> not a parking engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2838.194s">But</a> clearly, Mr. President, that is not the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2841.677s">And</a> I don't have to be an engineer to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2844.059s">Leaving</a> it the way it is is not the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2847.022s">So</a> that's what we have to do as a community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2850.445s">And</a> if we're going to make it safe, I realize we can't make every road right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2853.848s">But</a> if we're going to do this project, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2855.569s">and</a> call it Safe Routes to School, and I have parents that have sent him emails saying, you know, I live near Medford Square, and thank goodness my son can take his bike now to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2865.693s">I'm</a> concerned with that, because guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2867.593s">I'm</a> putting my stamp of approval on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2869.914s">And</a> I don't feel safe, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2872.055s">And</a> no one's going to tell me otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2873.756s">No</a> one's going to tell me otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2875.756s">Point</a> of information on that big paper?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3120.609s">Is</a> that question for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3121.81s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3126.944s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to leave it open ended because, you know, we may be also talking about the other end of high street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3134.426s">So,</a> you know, as I stated, I'm not a traffic engineer, but really it doesn't make sense for us to put a stamp of approval on something that I don't, I don't believe is safe in particular for elementary school kids to be riding. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3146.65s">So</a> I'm going to leave that open ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3148.251s">It's</a> not contingent upon approval, but, um, you know, I hope Tim takes this back to the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3154.913s">and</a> let them know that something needs to be done immediately there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3158.015s">Even</a> though there may be long-term plans, something needs to be done immediately with this project.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3531.403s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3536.246s">Mr.</a> President, we may have some, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3538.038s">residents</a> that like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3539.599s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4249.672s">Just</a> a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4252.754s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4255.015s">Can</a> this information be put on the government channel as well as community access, or is it already there?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4668.891s">We</a> have some amendments, move for approval.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5185.989s">Yes,</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5188.832s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5190.232s">I</a> can appreciate the intent of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5193.053s">However,</a> it's not as clear as what was stated about a longstanding history, because I'd say over the past 20 years, at least 15 or 16 of those years, use variances were not issued by the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5208.936s">And</a> it was just really recent, of recent time, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5212.057s">that</a> the Zoning Board of Appeals started to flex their muscle and issue use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5218.819s">It</a> was also stated that this has never been appealed, or no body or entity has ever appealed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5226.602s">In</a> 2016, Mr. President, the Method City Council sued our own Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5235.237s">And</a> one part of the suit was that the voting board gave out too many variances, and also that use variances are not authorized in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5250.193s">That</a> came from a unanimous vote of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5254.125s">after</a> we hired a zoning attorney to represent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5257.666s">So</a> as early as 2016, June of 2016, we were on record as a council saying, it's illegal what the zoning board did by giving the use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5267.729s">So</a> it's not as clear as was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5270.45s">My</a> hope, Mr. President, is that when we start to go through and codify like we just spoke about in the committee of the whole, that we'll address these issues one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5281.713s">Not</a> to rush to judgment now to address this, you know What's being asked is to give the authority to an appointed board to do really what should be set forth in zoning regulations and rules by the Medford City Council and to give the authority to an appointed board to go and potentially <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5305.765s">two</a> houses down from you, take it from a residential zone to a commercial zone or industrial zone, give them that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5315.375s">I</a> don't want to do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5317.457s">I</a> personally don't want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5319.319s">I</a> think the council should sit down and put together a thoughtful zoning plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5326.767s">And</a> we should be the ones that dictate, not pass that responsibility off to the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5333.795s">So</a> this has indeed been challenged by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5338.781s">It's</a> not as clear cut as was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5341.924s">uh</a> that uh you know the city solicitor came out with an opinion uh which is great uh mr president i've also been told that it was a ballot question back some 18 years ago and that was uh part of the footnote that is currently part of our ordinance that puts a footnote out there and um <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5362.618s">There's</a> a lot to this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5364.879s">And</a> I personally think we should go through the codification. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5369.263s">We</a> should take a look at this and do a thoughtful process, Mr. President, rather than just a knee-jerk reaction at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5377.669s">We</a> waited this long, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5379.39s">The</a> ambiguity has been around for many, many years, no matter who you talk to, because there's two sections that reflect different language within our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5389.117s">And</a> that's where the problem lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5391.66s">And</a> does it need to be addressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5394.344s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5395.505s">Is</a> this the way of addressing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5397.167s">I</a> don't agree with this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5399.81s">And</a> I personally think the council took a stance back in 2016 for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5405.817s">And</a> one of the reasons was to protect neighborhoods, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5409.561s">And</a> we, at that time, felt that the Zoning Board of Appeals didn't have the authority to act and do a use change. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5416.907s">And</a> I still feel that way, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5419.45s">And</a> eventually, that'll be my vote when it comes time that I will not be supporting giving out that authority to an appointed board where the Medford City Council should be doing that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5431.1s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5562.344s">Mr.</a> President, also when the council is bringing this suit against the Zoning Board of Appeals, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5573.191s">We</a> were also advised by the city solicitor that he felt that we had standing as a city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5579.798s">So</a> I mean, you know, if anyone could show me and I've talked to people that have been on the council when this change supposedly took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5588.646s">And</a> I can't get anyone to verify that this was ever changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5593.892s">So</a> if anyone could show that to me, and in my research, my personal research, I can't find it anywhere written. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5601.719s">I</a> can't find the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5603.141s">I</a> can't find anything that states when this was changed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5606.724s">So</a> it's nice to just put things out there, and the fact that papers were offered before the council is meaningless. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5612.811s">Because</a> that doesn't mean anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5614.733s">People</a> offer papers before the council all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5617.616s">I</a> disagree, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5618.758s">It</a> actually doesn't mean something. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5619.959s">Because</a> it goes to the motivation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5621.381s">Councilman</a> Marks has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5623.663s">Yeah,</a> people offer things, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5625.165s">I</a> have the floor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5629.183s">Mr.</a> President, people offer things for different motivations. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5632.705s">And</a> I don't know when those papers were offered, for what motivation, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5636.626s">All</a> I can tell you, Mr. President, is that I can't find it anywhere that shows that this was voted on by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5645.17s">And</a> there's ambiguity in the current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5648.614s">And</a> that's why we challenged it as a city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5651.396s">And</a> don't forget, when we came back with no standing, we appealed February 1, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5655.701s">The</a> city council unanimously, all seven councilors, voted to appeal the land court decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5663.541s">And</a> that was after Mark Rumley's decision that was done in July of 2016, stating that there are allowed uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5672.663s">We</a> still went forward, Mr. President, after the land court. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5676.324s">And</a> then for other reasons, it was dropped and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5679.325s">But</a> we still went forward with what was offered, stating that we didn't believe that a use variance could be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5686.687s">And</a> that's the exact language by the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5690.815s">So</a> we went forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5691.836s">So</a> who do we believe? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5692.797s">Do</a> we believe the two papers that came before us that no one voted on? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5696.379s">Do</a> we believe the council that went forward in 2016 and 18 for a lawsuit and land court? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5702.243s">I</a> mean, who, I don't know, who do we believe? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5704.745s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5705.626s">Councilor</a> Knight?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5773.438s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5776.239s">I'd</a> question, what is our position on use variances? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5780.983s">pursuant</a> to the vote 18376. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5784.225s">Mr.</a> President, we have two new councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5787.868s">We</a> have two new councillors, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5790.489s">I</a> myself am not in support of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5792.891s">So</a> I don't know what the gentleman's talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5796.013s">Maybe</a> he's referring to councillors from 20 years ago where they stood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5799.875s">But</a> let me tell you, that's not where I currently stand.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5854.547s">Mr.</a> President, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5855.668s">If</a> that truly was the case, mr President, why are we as a meffitt city council sending them anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5861.272s">They're</a> an autonomous body. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5862.453s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5863.274s">They</a> don't answer to the meffitt city council So why do we if this is so clear as my council colleague is stating? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5869.919s">Why</a> do we have to mention anything to them?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5886.126s">So</a> are they a violation?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5889.408s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5998.505s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6000.694s">What</a> information, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6002.876s">It's</a> as clear as mud, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6005.518s">And</a> for my council colleague just to state that he believed the Zoning Board of Appeals made an error in judgment when they voted on something shows you how unclear this is, Mr. President, because they're all very capable people on that Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6020.009s">So</a> it's not as clear as stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6021.991s">This</a> is not something, you know, against a colleague or this or that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6028.676s">OK,</a> I just want to make sure, Mr. President, that when the Zoning Board of Appeals gets together and discusses an issue, a use variance is probably one of the highest standards of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6040.286s">Think</a> about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6041.066s">You're</a> changing the use of a particular site. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6044.389s">You're</a> not doing a setback, or you're not doing something about a height limitation, or whatever, topography. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6050.574s">You're</a> talking about changing the use of a property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6053.777s">That</a> is probably the most sacred part of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6057.701s">And</a> to say that our Zoning Board of Appeals doesn't understand that, whether you can give or use variance or not, maybe they shouldn't be on the Zoning Board of Appeals if they don't understand that aspect of the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6069.571s">That's</a> a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6070.132s">That's</a> a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6071.113s">But</a> the point is it's not clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6072.894s">That's</a> the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6074.016s">So</a> I would caution my colleagues <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6075.899s">You</a> know, we're in the process of changing things now and finally looking after a couple of decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6081.044s">Let's</a> do this right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6082.446s">Let's</a> do this right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6083.747s">You</a> know, and some of us may have difference of opinion like I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6087.211s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6088.733s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Martz.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6139.888s">It's</a> up to the Zoning Board of Appeals, not us.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6157.507s">There's</a> two conflicting sections in the zoning I think that's what council beers is alluding to right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6856.865s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6857.966s">I</a> think any time you can plan ahead of time is prudent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6862.248s">So</a> I support planning ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6865.509s">Don't</a> think for a second that the city administration doesn't have a plan A, a plan B, and a plan C that they're currently working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6873.833s">And</a> as I stated last week when we talked to the independent auditor, I remember years over the last several years of recent that we'd get a budget two or three days before it's due. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6884.978s">Now</a> we're a month and a half, and it's like the sky's falling in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6890.464s">I</a> realize that we're facing some tough times, but I think we have to let the process play out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6896.611s">The</a> independent auditor also said over the next two to three weeks that we should get some meaningful answers on revenue projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6905.74s">And</a> I, as one person, Mr. President, especially now when people are in fear, people are in fear right now, I don't want to put together a worst-case budget just for the sake of putting together a worst-case budget and alarming people because you know what's going to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6922.443s">You're</a> going to have to make tough decisions, as Councilor Knight mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6925.644s">And</a> with those decisions, you're going to have to mention layoffs, potential layoffs and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6930.905s">And</a> if we can avoid that, Mr. President, without alarming people, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6935.046s">and</a> get to the numbers we need to get to, why do we have to put together a budget now and alarm people that may potentially lose their jobs? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6944.082s">if</a> that's not the case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6946.343s">And</a> regarding a bailout, I mean, you know, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6950.844s">I'd</a> ask anyone if they're going to return their stimulus check. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6953.845s">That's</a> a bailout. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6955.445s">You</a> know, people are going to return your stimulus check again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6957.906s">You</a> know, if the city needs the funds, Mr. President, because revenue projections are down, local aid is going to be down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6965.388s">then</a> so be it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6967.029s">And</a> if that's what we have to wait for, then I'm willing to wait, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6971.19s">And,</a> you know, we've waited in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6973.791s">I</a> think we should wait now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6974.891s">I</a> think we should stay fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6976.632s">I</a> think we should see what the administration's working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6979.213s">You</a> know, in the past, as I mentioned, when you would talk about a 1-12 budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6984.835s">It</a> was always the city administration, Mr. President, that was against the 112th budget, because they didn't want the council to have the purse strings every month, and they didn't want to be accountable to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6995.341s">So</a> every mayor for the past 20 years in this city, when a 112th budget was brought up, they've always rejected it immediately, saying they're not interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7004.679s">Now</a> it seems to be the wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7006.74s">Now</a> everyone's looking at a 112 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7009.561s">And</a> maybe that's the direction we need to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7012.262s">I</a> don't know, Mr. President, but I think we should wait this out a few more weeks to see what a city auditor says, see where the projections come in, see where the revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7021.766s">Don't</a> forget we extended the taxes to June 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7025.43s">A</a> lot of this is dependent on what tax revenue we experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7029.292s">And</a> so far, we were told by the auditor that we're higher than expected, the amount of money we received so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7035.795s">I</a> think we anticipate about $29 or $30 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7039.216s">I</a> want to say they received $12 or $13 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7042.638s">The</a> number escapes me, but to date so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7046.119s">So</a> I think we're looking good with the revenue that we anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7050.641s">Local</a> receipts are down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7052.402s">We</a> have to take our time on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7055.615s">And</a> I think trying to force the hand we've never gotten it since I've been on the council We've never gotten involved with the city administration when they established their budget never Now we're hearing about I want to see the department head's wish list <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7070.455s">We've</a> never had access. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7071.696s">That's</a> always been between the mayor and the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7074.458s">And</a> when the department heads appear before the Medford City Council, we can ask, why is your budget like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7079.561s">Do</a> you have a wishlist? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7080.762s">We</a> can ask that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7081.782s">But</a> that's always been between the administration and their department heads, not the responsibility of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7089.467s">So</a> I can appreciate the fact that we want to try to get ahead of this, but that's not overstep our boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7095.651s">The</a> administration is responsible for the establishment of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7099.895s">And</a> that's their responsibility, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7102.416s">So</a> let's let this process play out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7104.937s">However</a> we can assist, I think we're all willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7108.018s">Let's</a> not overstep our boundary. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7109.899s">And</a> let's have a better idea and understanding what revenues we're going to receive before we start alarming police, fire, teachers of layoffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7120.643s">Because</a> when you create a budget that's $8 million short, you're going to be looking at bodies, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7125.265s">I</a> can guarantee you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7126.265s">I've</a> been around for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7127.405s">You're</a> going to be looking at bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7129.437s">And</a> if we don't need to get into those conversations, why do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7133.078s">Why</a> alarm people? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7134.198s">People</a> have enough on their mind right now with this COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7137.799s">Why</a> tell them that potentially they could lose their job when it's not even necessary, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7143.6s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7144.84s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7927.612s">Can</a> we move to second that Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7978.992s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7980.093s">Just</a> if I can add because last week when we were talking about creative ideas, I did mention about the water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7988.897s">And</a> we have a history in this community of borrowing from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7994.619s">And</a> that's at no expense to the ratepayer or taxpayer in this community because <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8000.382s">It's</a> an over assessment of the water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8003.664s">However,</a> you got to be careful that you don't deplete that because it's for infrastructure improvements, but there's several millions of dollars in that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8011.977s">that</a> potentially could be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8014.057s">Also,</a> Mr. President, back some years ago, just in line with Councilor Bears' mentioning, the council entertained looking at a tax amnesty program, where people in this community owed taxes for many years and weren't paying that they weren't subjected to the interest rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8035.981s">And</a> it was a way of bringing in hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8041.082s">opening</a> up a period of time with his amnesty for people that are taxed delinquent to come and pay their back taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8047.769s">And</a> that just may be an option that's explored too. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8050.151s">So</a> there are many options out there that can be looked at, Mr. President, in order to potentially have a savings for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8059.881s">The</a> last thing I'd like to say, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8063.144s">It's</a> great to say, well, let's put together the budget the way it stands now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8066.907s">If</a> it's $8 million in deficit, let's put it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8069.969s">That's</a> going to be, Mr. President, very alarming to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8073.151s">And</a> I know my council colleagues don't want to hear that, but it's going to be very alarming to have a public document out there, Mr. President, that's going to show that magnitude of cuts across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8086.421s">And</a> I personally don't want to experience that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8089.423s">I</a> don't think there's a need. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8090.384s">Because</a> I think over the next several weeks, the mayor mentioned to us when we pressured the mayor, and I think we all did, to get a preliminary budget that she was looking at, I believe, Mr. President, you were on board too, the first week in June, I think we got a commitment that she was going to give us a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8107.056s">And</a> in my opinion, that gives us ample time to work with it and see if it's realistic or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8113.72s">And</a> also, in my opinion, it's probably the earliest that we've gotten a budget in the past 20 years, even with all this facing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8121.024s">So</a> I still think we have enough time, Mr. President, and by then we'll have some of the numbers that the auditor talked about in to give us better projections to see where we stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8133.232s">And</a> that number, 8 million, may go up, it may go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8135.934s">We</a> don't know, but time will tell, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8138.656s">So</a> I support all these initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8141.318s">Everyone</a> wants additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8143.84s">I</a> just think that we should give the administration the ample opportunity to work with the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8149.444s">As</a> Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, he's working with the City of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8153.487s">He's</a> the department head within the City of Somerville, and he's working with the mayor there to go over his budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8158.91s">And</a> that's what I'm saying should be done in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8161.151s">The</a> mayor should be working with the department heads, and if she's able to share information with the council, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8167.995s">But</a> eventually we're going to get a budget like we've done for the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8172.378s">And</a> we were never privy to any of that information, Mr. President, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8176.539s">And</a> I don't remember any councilor ever requesting this information either, Mr. President, over the last years that they want to see the wish list from the department heads prior to us getting the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8188.502s">I've</a> never mentioned that or never seen that mentioned as a council resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8194.623s">But</a> hey, maybe this is the time to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8198.264s">But</a> I think we have to let this process play out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8201.685s">and</a> see where we stand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8204.646s">Point</a> of clarification, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8268.986s">No</a> worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8269.767s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8270.367s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could, there were a lot of requests asked for last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8274.85s">And</a> one of the original requests was for the department head wishlist budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8279.772s">And</a> chief of staff Dave Rodriguez said he didn't feel comfortable sharing that at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8284.955s">because</a> it was in the early stages and may didn't have a time to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8288.997s">So</a> indeed, I don't know who asked for it, but someone did ask for a department head wish list budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8294.7s">And</a> he didn't think it was fruitful or would have been valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8297.962s">And</a> one of the Councilors said, I'll consider what's valuable to share a department head wish list budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8304.146s">And</a> that was what was requested, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8306.387s">So-</a> I was the Councilor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8528.723s">Council</a> of Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8530.756s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8531.937s">I</a> met with residents of the 9th Street Condo Association several months back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8537.981s">We</a> met with the city engineer and the traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8543.184s">We</a> came up with a number of recommendations for 9th Street and Brainerd Ave, and some of which has yet to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8552.55s">One</a> is the marking to divide 9th Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8555.732s">If</a> you're familiar with the street next to Cappy's, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8558.514s">when</a> you take a right or left onto 9th Street, there's no dividing line. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8562.936s">So</a> it's very difficult when cars are coming off of 9th Street or going onto 9th Street to see the delineation in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8570.46s">So</a> we ask that a yellow marker, paving marker be put down and also that the potholes in 9th Street be repaired or repaved in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8602.275s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8668.092s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8669.733s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8670.574s">I</a> want to thank Council Vice President Caraviello for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8674.377s">I've</a> received so many calls from Salt Method residents regarding tough square, the inability for any large trucks or buses to take turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8684.626s">around</a> that intersection over there, the getting caught midway between. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8690.43s">So</a> I would ask if Council Vice President's are right to amend that we receive a report back from the city engineer and the traffic engineer on the status of that project as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8703.138s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9079.839s">I</a> think I know where you were going. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9081.36s">Yeah,</a> I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9082.892s">Don't</a> tell them about the gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9086.094s">I</a> heard everything, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9087.595s">Where</a> was I?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9282.196s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9284.123s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9285.164s">This</a> may sound familiar to some of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9288.347s">Several</a> months back, I offered a very similar resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9292.15s">The</a> reason why I bring it up again this evening is the fact that last week when we were discussing the budget, it was mentioned that we could look and potentially save some money with the waste management contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9305.788s">which</a> we all, I should say we all, which I thought was coming up at the end of this year for renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9313.175s">And</a> come to find out when the mayor mentioned it doesn't renew until 2023, Dave Rodriguez, the chief of staff, sent us a copy of the amended contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9328.067s">I</a> was on the council at the time, Mr. President, and I looked through my records. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9333.372s">I</a> can't find anywhere that the city administration entered into a new renewal with waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9342.36s">Now,</a> I know it happened, so I'm not trying to say it didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9346.244s">But</a> at the time, back in 2010, the city administration, and I just want to give a little <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9354.198s">history</a> on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9355.398s">The</a> city administration, Mr. President signed a nine year eight or nine month contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9363.781s">So</a> it's 9.75 year contract with waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9368.686s">Now,</a> in order to enter that contract by state law, anything over three years has to be approved by the council, any contract with a length over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9380.256s">So</a> then Mayor McGlynn approached the council and asked that we approve a 10-year contract, which we did, Mr. President, at the time, because there was some savings in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9393.226s">Unbeknownst</a> to me, some three and a half years later, into a 10-year contract, the mayor went back and extended the contract another three years, which he was able to do so under state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9407.855s">So</a> it went from a 10-year contract, almost a 10-year contract, to a 13-year contract, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9415.24s">And</a> I found it ironic that at the time when the mayor renegotiated, waste management gave us an incentive of $400,000 to renegotiate the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9429.269s">And</a> the only other change, Mr. President, was an increase in the recyclable rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9436.414s">So</a> there's a fee that they're processing fee that went up from $50 per ton to $85 per ton. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9443.615s">which</a> would lead someone to believe, why would you be negotiating after you have a 10-year contract for a higher rate for recycling? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9451.079s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9453.38s">Unless,</a> of course, you're looking for a quick fix of some incentive money, which the city received. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9459.703s">Putting</a> that all aside, Mr. President, because I'm going to bring that up another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9465.025s">I</a> offered a resolution on behalf of Maple Park condominiums because currently right now they only have recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9472.808s">So</a> when the contract was made, apparently the city went around back some years ago to all the condominium associations and said, how would you like to participate? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9481.331s">Would</a> you like bulk pickup? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9482.391s">Would</a> you like recycling? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9483.732s">Would</a> you like trash pickup? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9485.307s">And</a> at the time, the different condo associations chose what they wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9489.988s">Some</a> opted, like Maple Condominiums, Park Condominiums, opted just for recycling only. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9495.97s">Now,</a> several years later, they said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9498.211s">We'd</a> like to get into the bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9500.352s">We'd</a> be interested in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9502.032s">And</a> other condos have approached the administration previous administrations and they were allowed into different aspects of the program And they are asking now to be part of bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9513.015s">So</a> i'm requesting originally the council if you remember we voted to wait for the city budget to add them or <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9521.741s">uh,</a> we voted to wait till the contract ended, which we all thought was too, at least I thought was 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9528.007s">So</a> knowing that, um, we're not gonna, if this doesn't end until 2023, um, that I'm asking now that we don't wait for anything and that the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9538.377s">add</a> Maple Park condominiums, I believe it's 35 or 40 condos in there, add them to the bulk pickup, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9544.361s">That's</a> all they're requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9545.802s">There's</a> a public list out there that shows you the different condos and what they receive as city services and waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9553.887s">And</a> it's my understanding the city just has to make a call to waste management and ask that this be done for Maple Park condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9561.511s">So</a> I'd like to do that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that the bulk pickup <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9567.642s">be</a> added immediately to Maple Park condominiums.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9624.044s">I</a> don't remember seeing that, but if that's the case, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9626.827s">I</a> don't think it's the case because the residents are still calling me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9630.93s">They</a> were actually asking me about the budget, if we're gonna put it in the budget, and that's why it precipitated this new resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9636.915s">So</a> that may be the case, but I don't know.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9712.492s">By</a> request. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9713.514s">My</a> understanding, it's by request.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9716.738s">That's</a> my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9717.76s">I'm</a> talking to DPW.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9779.481s">I</a> was told by the condo association that at the time they were instructed by certain type of bins that were compatible with waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9790.155s">And</a> it would have been a great expense to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9792.397s">So</a> they figured out rather than buy these new bins They already had bins that they would just bypass the service Now there it's I guess fruitful for them to participate and that's why they want to participate But I think at the time they had to get a certain bin and they weren't willing to do that to fit the you know compatible with waste management, but <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9814.872s">These</a> are all great questions, and I don't think we do have a formal approach once the contract is signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9820.737s">If</a> condos would like to get back in, and they all pay taxes as was mentioned, they should have the ability to opt back in if they'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9828.182s">So</a> maybe that's something that could be explored by our DPW subcommittee.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_f5vBHpQjllA/2024-11-19_f5vBHpQjllA.html">City Council 05-05-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1150.032s">In</a> length of service, not age, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1156.997s">Mike</a> Endicott, anyone that knows Lieutenant Mike Endicott, he is a tremendous firefighter, led by example, well liked among his peers, was the first to volunteer for anything going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1172.3s">And,</a> you know, from what I hear from other firefighters, he would be someone that you'd want to go to a fire with. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1179.782s">That</a> was the type of firefighter Mike was. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1182.042s">He's</a> a terrific husband, a great father. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1186.183s">a</a> family man, and I wish him well, Mr. President, on his retirement and want to thank him on behalf of the residents of this community for the exemplary service for 32 years for the life and property of Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1205.306s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1206.226s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Locks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1952.484s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1953.565s">I</a> want to thank council beers for bringing this up, uh, this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1958.188s">I</a> also want to concur with council tonight that it's very important that the council receive a timeline of events, uh, through over the past eight weeks on, uh, what has occurred within the courtyard in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1971.618s">I</a> also heard some troubling comments by a representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1975.073s">from</a> courtyard, Mr. President, as early as today regarding what took place at the courtyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1982.677s">And</a> it was stated, well, these particular clients are all over the age of 80. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1988.379s">And</a> I think that's a pretty troubling comment to make, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1992.802s">I</a> realize the nature of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, but that comment, I think, Mr. President, speaks volume on how maybe the situation was handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2004.751s">Um,</a> so I appreciate what Councilor Knight offered, and I want to concur with the timeline.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2252.847s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2254.689s">I</a> had the opportunity to tune in last, I believe it was Thursday, the school committee had a meeting regarding concerns of budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2264.379s">And</a> they had the city's auditor present, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2269.243s">And</a> I thought it was quite enlightening to hear some of the concerns on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2274.707s">But</a> it was equally as stressful to hear that we're looking at potentially a 20% cut in local aid, which amounts to about a little over $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2290.279s">We</a> are also looking at cuts in permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2295.603s">when</a> I say cuts and permits, a reduction in permits close to $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2301.289s">Vehicle</a> excise is down 7%. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2304.312s">Hotel</a> and mails tax is down about a million dollar reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2309.197s">Fixed</a> costs are up, health insurance and unfunded liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2315.804s">And</a> the list goes on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2318.106s">Ultimately,</a> I think what was stated, we're looking at a little over $8.2 million shortfall in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2326.916s">And</a> depending on what happens this June 1st, they extended the deadline for taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2333.403s">If</a> we don't receive the full $29 million in taxes, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2338.765s">uh,</a> which, uh, many people, uh, this community might be had press to send their taxes on time, uh, even with the extension, uh, that'll only add to our budget deficit gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2350.209s">Uh,</a> so the 8 million could quickly grow, uh, to 10, 12, 14 million, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2355.698s">And</a> I think as many Councilors are aware, our budget is probably about 85% salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2362.863s">So</a> when you look at tightening your belt, unfortunately, the belt tightening mostly is around personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2370.609s">And</a> that's where you can get into issues of furloughs and other options, days off and so forth, which I hope we never have to explore, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2384.48s">The</a> one thing that was stated, and it was just stated briefly, we hear so much about the federal government bailing everyone out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2393.554s">Um,</a> and, uh, we have yet to receive, uh, any, uh, idea from the federal government, uh, about federal assistance, um, for a bailout of cities and towns that are really getting impacted by this COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2409.582s">And,</a> uh, in my opinion, we as a council should be soliciting or lobbying, uh, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2416.318s">to</a> make sure that whatever we experience in a budget gap is made up by the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2423.045s">And</a> I think right now, I would ask that we send a letter from the council to our federal delegation <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2432.035s">asking</a> that the city of Medford, and I'm sure Dave is probably already in the process of doing this, but asking our federal delegation to assist us with a bailout, knowing that the state local aid is going to be cut, local receipts are down, taxes are probably going to be down, and fixed costs are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2453.802s">And</a> our options right now, we do have about 10 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2458.765s">But</a> as the mayor mentioned, we don't want to go through all our free cash because that leads us in a vulnerable position. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2465.949s">So</a> even though we do have an ample amount of free cash, I think we have to look for just as that kind of a rainy day fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2474.793s">Um,</a> so, um, there was some discussion during the school committee meeting and with the city auditor, uh, about what should we do with this year's budget that's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2484.622s">And</a> I think one of the recommendations was a level funded budget makes most sense and most appropriate at this time, uh, knowing that there's probably going to be a shortfall and any additions to the budget, uh, is going to mean deletion somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2501.097s">Um,</a> you know, not to say there's some good ideas floating out there that could be revenue generators, uh, or, uh, cost savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2511.303s">Um,</a> and I think those should be explored, but I think a level funded budget right now, in my opinion, uh, makes sense, Mr. President with COVID and knowing that, uh, receipts are limited right now in the city and maybe that way for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2527.671s">It's</a> hard to put a finger on it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2530.272s">So</a> I just wanted to bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2531.852s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2532.412s">I</a> know we're meeting Thanks to your leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2534.853s">I</a> think it's what Thursday Thursday night at 530 and we're gonna get another briefing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2541.275s">Mr.</a> President and hopefully we'll start I know we were promised we were gonna start looking at the budget in April and I realized there's a million things going on believe me and <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2550.597s">So</a> I'm not trying to be critical at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2553.359s">But</a> the school committee has started their process. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2556.402s">And</a> I just want to say that I think we need to start meeting with the department heads and so forth very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2564.789s">Because</a> as Council Vice President Caraviello mentioned, this is going to be a trying budget for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2573.294s">And</a> I think the earlier we start, the earlier we get a grasp on what direction we want to go in, the better off we'll be as a council and as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2581.681s">So</a> I just want to put that out there, Mr. President, and I look forward to hearing what my other colleagues have to say.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2596.853s">I</a> would, Mr. President, and we can add our state delegation in as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2600.436s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3002.687s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3004.648s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Larkins. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3007.69s">I</a> thought it was mentioned that he was hired by the city about two years ago, because Melanson was our outside auditor for 30 years.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3444.279s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to say in these trying times, I think it's even more <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3455.081s">more</a> important that we as a council work collaboratively with the mayor and the school committee and You know, we're one city as you always say, mr. President one method. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3467.095s">You're</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3467.896s">We're</a> one method and you know when I <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3471.46s">people</a> make comments regarding putting people on the hot seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3476.322s">And</a> that does a disservice, Mr. President, to this entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3481.985s">And</a> it's not what we need right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3484.106s">We</a> need to support and build up each other and not make comments about putting people on the hot seat and making people take tough votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3492.81s">Because,</a> you know, this is going to be extremely difficult for everyone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3499.433s">The</a> last thing we need <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3500.793s">is</a> people acting in a contentious way. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3503.754s">And</a> I just want to put that out there, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4213.542s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4215.544s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4216.324s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4221.067s">You</a> know, Mr. President, when the school committee votes for their budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4226.033s">It's</a> a majority vote, and that's the will of the school committee, which is then presented to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4234.643s">I</a> can't recall, I've been on a number of years, I can't recall ever the council cutting the school budget once it's submitted to us, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4245.493s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I can recall many times where this council has stood up and voted for new technology, school building assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4255.323s">You</a> name it, Mr. President, we've stepped up to the plate on numerous occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4260.669s">So</a> if there are concerns with the school budget that relies on the school committee, not the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4268.817s">We're</a> presented with their budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4271.463s">We</a> can't add to it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4273.768s">We</a> can't do anything other than approving the total city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4278.905s">And</a> that's where we stand with this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4281.286s">So</a> for someone to stand forward and say, well, it's the council, that's being very disingenuous, Mr. President, because it's not the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4289.729s">It's</a> the school committee that creates the budget and then passes it on to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4294.57s">So</a> if the school committee wishes to do other things, increase their budget, that's their prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4302.513s">That's</a> their prerogative, and they should do so as elected officials in this community, as an autonomous body. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4309.463s">They're</a> not tied to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4312.15s">And</a> that's where it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4313.691s">So</a> I hope we can put this behind us and work forward, Mr. President, so we can address, as Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, so we can address all the needs of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4327.136s">The</a> council's here not just to address the municipal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4330.157s">We're</a> here to address all the needs as well as the school needs as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4334.719s">So</a> I'm willing to work with anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4337.868s">across</a> the aisle, but we have to do this together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4341.689s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4342.849s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=4344.249s">Councilor</a> Bears.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5318.42s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5319.541s">I'd</a> be remiss not to thank John Anderson. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5322.823s">He's</a> done yeoman's work, Mr. President, from archiving to making sure that that building has not given way over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5331.968s">And</a> there's many valuable archived items in that building, which saves our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5338.611s">And</a> I just want to ask John if air conditioning is in the future for that building.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5351.317s">Great</a> news. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5351.938s">How</a> are you going to fund it, John?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5361.101s">That's</a> great.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5391.68s">and</a> you know that those are old people. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5396.925s">Thank</a> you, John, you do tremendous work and your group does tremendous work. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5400.528s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5401.388s">The</a> residents are appreciative, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5404.511s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5804.304s">I</a> reviewed the records, found them to be in order and move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5808.146s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_9xgbSMjoV58/2024-11-19_9xgbSMjoV58.html">City Council 04-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1141.674s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1142.695s">I</a> want to thank Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez for his timely response. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1148.297s">The</a> question I do have, and maybe I didn't pose it correctly last week, I'm trying to figure out how existing sidewalks are on our list currently.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1189.545s">Okay,</a> in the past, Dave, we were able to get a list of sidewalk repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1197.388s">And</a> by a number of criteria, the date it was requested, the type or condition of the sidewalk, when it was reported, <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1209.615s">uh,</a> when, when it's scheduled to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1212.276s">So</a> there was a list that it was, uh, you know, available in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1215.837s">I'm</a> just trying to get a handle on, uh, knowing that in 2019, we did roughly 232 sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1223.68s">Um,</a> what percent of, uh, this year's money will get us through what list we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1230.083s">So</a> if we have a thousand on the list, is it safe to say we're going to do a quarter of the sidewalks or roughly?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1269.055s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1270.195s">So</a> based on the criteria information, one of the criteria is the age of the sidewalk and the other is condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1278.38s">And</a> I think there's a couple of other criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1281.202s">So</a> are all these sidewalks that are currently on the list <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1286.361s">I'm</a> just trying to pin down exactly what you're saying.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1321.13s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1321.39s">So</a> as one member of the council, it would be helpful to find out, first of all, the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1326.993s">And</a> that could be sent to us in an Excel spreadsheet very easily.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1330.901s">the</a> number of sidewalks that are on the list ranked by condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1334.863s">So</a> just say it's one through four. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1337.204s">If</a> four is a very problem trip hazard safety concern, it'd be interesting to know we have out of a thousand sidewalks, 800 of these compared to a level three or level two or level one. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1350.35s">So</a> that way, to me, it would be easier to make a judgment on whether or not we're actually moving forward on our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1357.796s">Because</a> after 20 years of doing this, I don't see us moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1362.699s">And</a> that's not a reflection on the current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1364.921s">But</a> to say how we've handled it over the years, we've never really gotten ahead of the current. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1371.526s">And</a> I want to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1373.387s">whether</a> it's the request of which Councilor Scarpelli and many Councilors have talked about, creating our own sidewalk crew, or just to continue the way we've done business with throwing a half a million dollars at a time at the problem and never really getting <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1391.533s">to</a> a point where we can say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1393.114s">We'll</a> make it some headway. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1394.495s">Because</a> I've been on the council 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1396.956s">I</a> don't know if we're making headway. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1398.717s">I'd</a> be surprised if any other councilors could tell me otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1402.178s">I</a> could tell you from residents' standpoint, they don't believe we're making any headway. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1406.161s">And</a> a lot of them that have been on the list for five, six, seven, eight years feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1410.743s">So</a> I just want to make sure we're moving in a direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1413.604s">And</a> I know this administration's interested in doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1419.107s">Provides</a> results for us and gives us a clear direction Whether or not we're making some headway and I don't think I've been able to accomplish that over the many years Start now And say hey, you know what moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1433.796s">Is</a> this the direction we want to continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1436.417s">We</a> want to keep on throwing money at this or do we want to maybe take this in-house? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1440.64s">And</a> I think this is gonna be the year for me to make that decision
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1488.792s">That'd</a> be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1489.372s">Thank</a> you, Jason. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1490.993s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3217.629s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3218.109s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3219.25s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Scott Pell and Councilor Knight and yourself for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3223.956s">As</a> was stated, the Maturana family have been in the city for many, many decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3229.102s">One</a> better than the next, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3232.125s">And,</a> you know, Jimmy fought a terrible illness <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3234.992s">So</a> for a long time, and not many people knew about it cause he kept it to himself and he didn't pity himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3242.001s">Um,</a> and, uh, you know, he will be as council Scarpelli mentioned, uh, truly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3247.928s">And,</a> uh, I hope, uh, all the siblings, uh, can. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3251.477s">uh,</a> take some solace from the fact that, um, he led such a great life with such great family men. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3257.681s">And,</a> uh, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, we'll leave a legacy in this community, uh, not just as a sportsman, which they all were, they're all great athletes, but as a family man and as a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3270.789s">Um,</a> and that I think goes much further than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3274.011s">Um,</a> so, uh, I'd like to dedicate this meeting, Mr. President, in Jimmy Maturana's honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3279.804s">Absolutely</a> agree.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4350.668s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4351.548s">I</a> want to thank Mr. Varnberg for bringing this issue up, because I know we've all been contacted by Medford residents that are equally as concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4360.771s">I</a> need to say over the last three or four weeks, this issue has evolved many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4366.993s">And</a> I think originally, if we all remember, the issue was don't wear mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4372.375s">Remember</a> when it first came out, they said mask won't help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4375.376s">And</a> don't wear mask and leave the mask for the health care professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4380.163s">the</a> first responders, and then it evolved into, as more information came in, that it is helpful to have a mask and to reduce the risks like Councilor Bears mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4390.453s">I</a> think there's a lot of misinformation out there that people believe if they, as long as they stay a social distance of six feet, in particular outside, there's no need for a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4401.824s">And</a> I think that's where a lot of the misinformation lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4405.087s">that</a> now that has also evolved and your footprint, so called footprint is left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4413.095s">And</a> that's critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4414.837s">I</a> just want to say to that mask is one aspect of PPE. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4418.941s">There's</a> also gloves. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4421.185s">The</a> disease is transmitted through droplets and so forth, but it's also transmitted through touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4428.467s">And</a> you could be somewhere with a mask on, touch a surface, and then put that fingers to your eyes, to your nose, to your mouth after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4440.81s">and</a> catch to the disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4442.451s">So</a> if you don't protect your hands as well as your face, you're equally as vulnerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4446.853s">So</a> whatever we do, I think we have to look at all aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4450.054s">And</a> in my opinion, I think it should be the wearing of gloves as well, the rubber gloves when you're out in public for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4458.278s">So</a> I think education, as the chief of staff mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4462.3s">is</a> extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4463.761s">The</a> fact that Councilor Morell and Councilor Caraviello mentioned that not everyone, I had to make homemade face masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4471.263s">And</a> it took quite some time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4473.204s">Everyone</a> says, oh, look online, you make a quick, easy one. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4476.265s">They're</a> not quick, easy, at least for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4478.406s">And</a> I consider myself pretty handy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4480.227s">They're</a> not quick and easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4481.607s">And</a> they don't fit right, they push your nose in, you can't breathe. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4485.389s">So</a> there's a lot more than just making a quick homemade mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4489.33s">And</a> I think if we can get these masks out to the general public, like was mentioned in Somerville and so forth, I think that'll go a long way for people that will have them near their front door, like I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4500.219s">Every</a> time I go out, boom, it goes on automatically because it's right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4504.723s">But</a> if I didn't have one in the house, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4508.266s">So</a> I think the first thing for prevention is to make sure that these are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4513.818s">And</a> I don't know what we can do to get these masks and rubber gloves out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4518.059s">But</a> I think that should be our first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4521.04s">I</a> don't like the concept of penalizing people, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4525.261s">I</a> know some communities of 200, 300 old fines for not wearing a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4531.003s">I</a> don't like that concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4532.91s">I</a> think you have to get people to comply in a way that you reason with them and say, hey, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4538.733s">This</a> is a concern for safety, concern for health. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4541.714s">Now</a> we're hearing over in England and so forth that they're saying that kids are coming down with some sort of disease from the COVID that they didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4554.563s">think</a> they were susceptible to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4556.344s">This</a> is brand new and they're starting to get cases over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4560.266s">You</a> hear animals now, dogs, cats, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4564.255s">So</a> this is something that we really have to take the initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4569.437s">I</a> personally think it should be done through an executive order, because I think that's the way it should be initiated from the governor on down. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4576.821s">If</a> the governor decides not to do it, then it's up to local cities and towns to take the responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4582.403s">So</a> I'd like to see the mayor take, I know she's taken a lot of leadership on this, but I think the next logical step is to mandate that if you're out, that you should wear a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4593.548s">And</a> then if you're talking about enforcement, do we have the capability of enforcing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4598.898s">Probably</a> not, but I think you'll see people comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4602.628s">if,</a> you know, they're reasoned with and provided the mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=4609.471s">So</a> that's my two cents, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=5124.937s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=5126.138s">Mr.</a> President, we do have Neil Osborne that's joining us and maybe he can give us just a brief overview of the census.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_U2DHdo_mFTc/2024-11-19_U2DHdo_mFTc.html">City Council 04-21-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=838.265s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=840.066s">For</a> previous phases of the sidewalk improvements, this council has requested if the administration is working from a current list, if so, what percent of the list will be accomplished <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=858.131s">through</a> this 500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=860.232s">So</a> that was one of the questions that was asked in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=863.453s">And</a> I was asked that that be re-asked again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=868.395s">Roughly</a> how many sidewalks do they feel will be accomplished with this 500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=875.738s">What</a> priority, if there is an existing list, will the sidewalks be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=880.619s">Is</a> there a priority list that is already established? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=885.361s">And</a> when will the work <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=888.144s">start</a> to take place, assuming it's approved.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=946.246s">However,</a> I mean, if you could do it either way, it doesn't matter to me.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1635.425s">Just</a> if I could, because I know some of my other colleagues expressed concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1640.327s">Over</a> the last several years, these particular requests for sidewalk repairs have been pretty consistent, as Council Vice President Caraviello mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1651.252s">And</a> the consistent question back from the council has been, what is the list we're working from? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1657.975s">Because</a> that's always been a moving target. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1661.174s">And</a> I think members that have served for a number of years were never able to get a working list of what sidewalks are on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1670.961s">Are</a> they prioritized? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1673.901s">And</a> then to accomplish some of the goals, I think, like Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears mentioned, is that when you hear phases, you assume that at some point this will be over, this phase one, phase two and phase three. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1686.892s">However,</a> since I've been on the council, it's never had an end and there's never been an end game. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1693.757s">And</a> I'm glad that we have a new administration now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1696.82s">So</a> I think these are important questions that we know what the list is, what is comprised of, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1703.822s">and</a> what we're going to get for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1706.265s">I</a> realize we're in the second half of a contract, but that way it'll give us an understanding that, you know, after we do this phase, there's another phase, or this is the last phase, and then everything coming in will be new requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1723.302s">We've</a> yet to get that over the years, and that's extremely vital so we can get a handle on it, like Councilor Scarpelli mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1730.544s">You</a> know, we probably could have hired three, four, five people with equipment and a crew to do it internally and get much more bang for our buck by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1740.107s">However,</a> we're at where we are right now, but I think moving forward, you know, I think we have to get these answers so we can make a financial decision that's good for this community and good for the taxpayers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1803.306s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1803.586s">And</a> just one last point, if I could, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1806.107s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1806.988s">Not</a> to belabor this, but because when you talk sidewalks, most people think, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1811.477s">Oh,</a> it's the replacement of a sidewalk panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1814.458s">But</a> many times the work goes into curbing, goes into the removal of tree stumps because they may be the hindrance why you can't put a sidewalk and there may be a catch basin that's located near the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1828.325s">And</a> that starts to expand the scope of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1831.806s">And</a> before you know it, rather than doing 500 panels or sidewalk panels, you're doing 50 with other related work. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1841.558s">These</a> are the questions I think that we have to have answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1844.42s">And</a> I know you can't tell sometimes until you get into a situation and say it involves much more than we anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1851.305s">But</a> these are the type of things we have to know because 500,000 sounds like a lot, but when you start to do work, it doesn't go very far at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1859.991s">So</a> I just want to put that out there.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2125.678s">While</a> we have the Chief of Staff, have you looked at any other funding sources other than bonding?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2138.959s">Right,</a> and we have what, at least four or five million in free cash or maybe even more?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2159.187s">And</a> that decision's already been made.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2168.514s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2169.074s">Can</a> you give us next time to just what we have out there for free cash?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2240.436s">Motion</a> to table, Mr. President, until we get answers from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2243.798s">Until</a> next week.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=3978.131s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=3981.113s">I</a> have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=3983.715s">First</a> of all, how did the CPC arrive at this dollar amount?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4077.173s">So</a> if I could, so it doesn't sound like you had any game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4082.159s">When</a> I say you, I don't mean you in particular, but it doesn't sound like there was a game plan on why 250,000 was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4093.201s">I</a> realize you had a half a million, but why was 250,000 selected? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4098.785s">Is</a> it based on a number of families we believe that may be able to take advantage and that number would suit what we have the need for? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4108.332s">And</a> the reason why I bring this up is from what I'm hearing is there's a potential that if we do prioritize method residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4117.598s">And</a> just say that we overestimated the amount of need that could be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4124.545s">And</a> for instance, only $75,000 of Method residents came forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4132.572s">The</a> other amount, according to what was stated, would have to go to other people that may be outside this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4140.939s">we</a> can't withdraw the money, right, once our priorities of method families are done, say, okay, now we want to opt out of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4149.442s">So,</a> I'm just wondering how we arrived at that 250.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4295.208s">Mr.</a> President, I also think it would be helpful maybe just to get an overview of eligibility requirements by the different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4307.531s">And</a> I think that would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4310.092s">And</a> my last point is, will the full amount be used towards rental assistance or is there an administrative cost associated with this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4357.85s">So</a> that's a 10% administrative cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4362.514s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4399.401s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4399.961s">And</a> just what, what about basic eligibility?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4420.464s">But</a> we just heard that's not a requirement.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4453.969s">You</a> don't look at income, you don't look at anything.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4510.736s">So</a> if they don't take part in stabilization, they can't take part of the program.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4884.63s">They</a> were, and I just had one follow up if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4886.932s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4888.594s">Because</a> we're talking one to 2,000, and I realize every case is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4894.279s">I</a> realize that, and I realize there's all different circumstances and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4898.34s">But</a> we're almost close to two months into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4901.541s">And</a> from what I'm hearing, this could last another month or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4906.003s">And</a> so you're potentially talking three, four, five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4910.284s">And</a> when I hear $1,000 or $2,000, believe me, every little bit helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4914.825s">But</a> rents in Method are no longer $1,000, $1,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4920.11s">They're</a> $2,000, $2,500, $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4922.932s">And</a> I'm just curious, if someone did lose their job or there's no income at all in the household, what is one or 2,000 going to do in a situation that you may need tens of thousands of dollars to keep someone going and functioning? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4941.607s">And,</a> uh, are we underestimating this? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4943.989s">I'd</a> hate to see this go to, uh, you know, I liked the more the merrier in my, in my opinion, I'd like to help out a vast number of people with the two 50, rather than just maybe a handful, uh, with the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4957.218s">So</a> I'm just wondering how, how do we work this, uh, to make sure that we spread it out and knowing that, um, we're spread thin already because. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4968.365s">you</a> know, $250,000 is not a lot to help a city of this size. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=4972.927s">So</a> I was just wondering if I could throw that out there.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6091.696s">Yeah,</a> Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6096.919s">Sorry</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6098.974s">This</a> question is for Tabitha. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6101.336s">Tabitha,</a> currently right now over the last six, seven weeks, I'm sure ABCD has fielded phone calls regarding Method residents that have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6111.547s">Is</a> that not correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6161.567s">What</a> about regarding housing assistance?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6172.29s">And</a> why is that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6209.17s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6209.971s">And</a> I'm just curious, what percent of ABCD's budget is state funded?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6257.046s">Either</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6257.867s">I'd</a> like to know how much of your housing program is state funded, um, of the housing program.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6272.924s">What</a> percent of housing is funded through the state?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6324.471s">Um,</a> yeah, my, my, my, my question is, cause it reaped my tweak. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6330.252s">My</a> curiosity is that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6333.042s">It</a> was just mentioned that Method residents really don't know that maybe rental assistance money may be available to ABCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6343.008s">And</a> I know for years, your organization has received either federal or state money. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6349.533s">And</a> I'm wondering why that outreach hasn't been done over the years, so that Method residents would know, hey, if I have a concern, let me pick up the phone and call an agency that's right next door in the city of Malden, and I may be able to get some assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6365.386s">So</a> that is my curiosity a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6368.888s">why</a> it seems to be new to the city of Medford where there's been federal and state money for many years.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6480.506s">Okay,</a> so the COVID-19 RAF money that was just made available, do we have any Medford residents taking advantage of that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6495.639s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6496.059s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6513.245s">So</a> have you sent method referrals into RAF?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6520.068s">And</a> why is that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6676.789s">That's</a> good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6678.131s">And</a> the success of this particular program we're talking about tonight will be based on the outreach <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6685.473s">that's</a> done by your organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6688.035s">And</a> as you know, I think we have a lot of outreach to do to make residents aware of what's currently happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6694.519s">And</a> the only reason why I brought up the other state funding or federal funding is that I want to make sure that Method residents, they may not be aware, but that they're getting a piece of the pie as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6706.247s">And</a> I know the government is throwing a lot of money into this COVID now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6710.941s">and</a> there's a lot of money being dished out, I want to make sure that Medford residents have a seat at the table as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6718.584s">And</a> I appreciate all your efforts.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6960.139s">Mr.</a> President, just that we'd be provided with any statistics, documentation of what currently is going on over the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6970.705s">And</a> if there is a need for an additional appropriation, that that information be provided.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7005.819s">The</a> reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7006.88s">So</a> any statistics reporting, number of families, the dollar amount each family got from the first, if you want to call it first allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7017.547s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7018.367s">So</a> then we can make an informed decision if additional money is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7024.051s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7190.73s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7192.191s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7193.753s">Just</a> before we call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7197.535s">Now,</a> the services that are provided by housing families, are they also providing some of the tracking <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7206.655s">that's</a> necessary over the six months, is that part of their responsibility?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7235.143s">So</a> I'm just trying to figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7236.344s">So</a> the 20,000 that's going to your organization is for what purpose?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7276.811s">So</a> is the 20,000 tied to the 250 in any way?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7287.827s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7442.34s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7443.42s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7444.241s">I'm</a> a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7446.322s">The</a> Millerons are only 45 years old.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7458.613s">I</a> agree with Councilor Knight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7461.334s">They're</a> two outstanding citizens and I wish them well on their 50th wedding anniversary.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8643.169s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8645.151s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8648.476s">Charlie</a> was truly a great man, a great advocate to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8654.204s">And</a> a little known fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8657.089s">uh,</a> Charlie was a former, uh, public safety officer and, um, you know, he was very instrumental in moving forward many public safety initiatives, uh, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of which, uh, the Shannon bill, uh, was named after Charlie Shannon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8674.097s">Um,</a> and, uh, you know, he, uh, as, uh, uh, Councilor Knight mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8680.774s">uh,</a> was a big constituent person. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8683.776s">Uh,</a> you know, the first thing that came to Charlie's mind was always how can I assist the city of Medford and how can I improve constituent services? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8693.552s">And</a> I think many of the local politicians took advice from him because that was his number one concern, addressing constituent, the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8704.097s">Everything</a> else was secondary. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8706.258s">And</a> he was a master at what he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8708.059s">And</a> again, I want to thank my colleague for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8712.421s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=9046.61s">Before</a> we adjourn?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=9049.466s">I</a> would just like to take this opportunity to thank Captain Brennan and Latitu along with the brave men and women of Latitu. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=9058.269s">They</a> were at the Glen Ridge nursing home just recently and brought up some food, which I thought was a great gesture in this time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=9068.471s">And</a> members of the Medford firefighters also did a tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=9072.935s">I</a> don't know if you saw it online, but they went by Wegmans in some of the stores, beeping the engines, horns, and thanking the workers that are out there very unselfishly, you know, doing the business to make sure that Medford residents have food and all the essentials. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=9092.109s">And</a> I just want to thank our brave men and women of both the police and fire department <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=9097.793s">and</a> all the other offices in the community, Mr. President, from people at City Hall to the public schools that are stepping up and answering the call, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_xiD5galYT24/2024-11-19_xiD5galYT24.html">City Council  04-14-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=643.578s">Um,</a> Joe, if many people were not aware, Joe was an avid singer, uh, as well as an historian. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=651.605s">So</a> he had a lot of man of many hats, a real Renaissance type man. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=656.889s">And,</a> uh, he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=659.992s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1003.067s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1003.95s">I'll</a> refer to the Vice President of the Method City Council, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1008.463s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1086.866s">Before</a> the city engineer, I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for co-sponsoring this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1093.291s">Mr.</a> President, I think we realize all too often <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1096.093s">Uh,</a> when utility work is being done in the community, first of all, uh, the utility companies will do their very best not to do curb to curb and explain the reasoning why. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1106.142s">Uh,</a> and secondly, uh, they'll come out depending on what time of year it is and say that, uh, this is only the initial patch job and, uh, the curb to curb restoration will take place at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1121.512s">And</a> I think it's important that we as a council get follow-up on our request to make sure that curb-to-curb is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1129.415s">And</a> even if it takes six to eight months to have it done, that this work truly gets done by the utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1137.637s">So</a> I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello for co-authoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1142.059s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2845.019s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2846.053s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2847.494s">And</a> I want to thank Tim because, uh, over the past year, he has done a lot of work in trying to pull everything together in the engineer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2857.278s">Um,</a> the medallion program that he's talking about, uh, I'd like to see that implemented citywide where temporary and permanent patches utility company puts a small medallion with their name, uh, what they're doing there and contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2874.069s">That</a> way, anyone in the city, not just someone from the city engineer's office, can walk down their street and say, you know what, I see a sinking hole there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2881.313s">It</a> has the name of this particular company on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2884.194s">And</a> then at least city hall knows what you're referring to and so forth and can get on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2889.957s">So</a> I appreciate that work that Tim's done on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2895.3s">Tim</a> mentioned about a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2897.301s">This</a> council has been calling for a capital plan for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2902.247s">And</a> I'm glad to hear that we will have a pavement capital plan because there's $0 allocated in the city's budget for total street repavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2913.117s">The</a> money that we get for street repavement comes from chapter 90 money, which is about $980,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2920.308s">And</a> you're talking maybe if you can get through a street or two with that amount of money, you're lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2925.67s">And</a> we have over 760 streets in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2930.131s">Uh,</a> so you can see we're never going to get ahead of it by just following chapter 90 money. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2935.053s">We</a> have to do some type of capital plan or put money on a yearly appropriation and the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2941.675s">Um,</a> you know, part of the frustration I think councilor Caraviello was talking about is every time a utility company appeared before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2949.868s">The</a> city engineer, and in this case it was the previous city engineer, would put all the agreements within the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2958.117s">And</a> you could bet your bottom dollar, it never said curb to curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2963.242s">It</a> was always permanent patch or restored as they found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2967.74s">And</a> it was the council that took a stance back a year or two ago saying, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2972.424s">We're</a> not going to tolerate this anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2974.045s">We</a> don't like the condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2975.446s">The</a> subcontractors and utility companies are leaving our streets and we're going to require pavement curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2983.712s">And</a> many of them kicked back at us and we kicked back at them saying, well, maybe you won't get it approved if you're looking to get it approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2990.357s">And</a> sure enough, each one over time committed to doing curb to curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2996.328s">So</a> part of the, uh, request, I think by councilor Caraviello myself, and I won't speak for him was to go back over the last year and a half, two years on all the council votes that requested curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3009.734s">As</a> a condition, not as just, Hey, will you please do this as a condition of approval, whether or not that got done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3016.837s">And</a> I realized it could be in the stages of getting done because Tim mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3021.465s">It</a> could be a temporary patch because there's other utility work being done there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3027.209s">And</a> that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3028.971s">Um,</a> in regards to, uh, creating an ordinance, this definitely needs to go to the public works subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3036.056s">Uh,</a> it's not a black and white issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3038.878s">There</a> are a lot of other circumstances that play a factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3042.421s">I</a> would personally like to know that my city engineer is backing what we think should be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3049.286s">And</a> I think that would be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3051.277s">So</a> even if we create an ordinance that gave direction to the city engineer saying, this is how we would like to operate as a city and as a city council, knowing that you have to use your expertise and so forth and your judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3065.97s">Uh,</a> you know, I don't think you can create a cookie cutter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3068.332s">We</a> want curb to curb on every project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3070.754s">Um,</a> so I, I think we need to craft something. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3073.917s">that's</a> meaningful that allows the city engineer to do his work and not tie his hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3080.443s">So</a> I'd like to see that be sent to the public works subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3084.947s">And</a> just my last point, as the city engineer just referred to, you'll have the same utility company, they outnumber us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3092.974s">So</a> they might have five trucks in the city and all aspects of the community doing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3099.357s">And</a> we may have one clerk of the work that's out there overseeing all these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3104.358s">It's</a> unrealistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3106.218s">And</a> that's just one utility company. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3108.559s">There</a> are several out there that may be doing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3111.119s">There</a> are subcontractors that are doing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3113.62s">So</a> I think in order to get on this, you know, get our hands around this problem, we do have to look and Tim, I'll say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3120.861s">If</a> you don't want, you don't want to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3122.882s">We</a> have to look at the budget and I think his office needs additional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3128.829s">And,</a> you know, we have to take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3131.171s">You</a> know, if we're going to talk about it, we was just talking last week about putting our money where our mouth is on a different subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3138.835s">I</a> think we have to put our money where our mouth is when it comes to our streets and our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3143.237s">Because</a> as Councilor Scarpelli says all the time, that's probably <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3147.57s">If</a> it's not the number one, it's the number two call I get regarding potholes, regarding sidewalks, regarding manholes that are sinking, regarding catch basins that are sinking all around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3159.458s">We</a> really have an old infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3161.86s">We</a> have to take a look at this and, uh, you know, we have to be smart about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3166.523s">So</a> I appreciate everything Tim's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3169.265s">Uh,</a> he's been very attentive over the last year and several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3173.448s">Um,</a> and I think he has us on the right track to moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3177.414s">But</a> I think this is a larger issue rather than just voting on something tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3182.018s">Let's</a> move something to subcommittee on public works and have them sit down and put something together meaningful that addresses all our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3191.147s">I</a> think we share all the same concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3193.409s">Let's</a> make sure someone's safeguarding our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3195.951s">Let's</a> make sure that whatever the utility companies are doing, <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3199.25s">They're</a> held accountable, and that's to make sure we have a plan that's endorsed by not just the city engineer, but by the mayor's office and by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3209.912s">Thank</a> you. <a

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4158.53s">Uh,</a> so now, now that, uh, consular beers, rent it back all street openings, uh, this, this would also include as the city engineer mentioned, the one-offs, uh, a resident that's trying to get, uh, you know, some utility to their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4173.278s">Um,</a> you know, that would be a huge hardship, uh, financially to some of that may be trying to do some work on their home, uh, to, to do some type of mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4184.065s">Um,</a> and I'm not quite sure if I can support that at this present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4189.79s">Um,</a> you know, if we're talking about national grid or the larger utility companies that are here doing work all the time and not the mom and pop one-offs, then I could support it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4212.519s">Mr.</a> President, if I could.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4214.881s">We</a> remember when Craddock Bridge was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4217.002s">That</a> was a four-year project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4219.604s">I</a> offered the resolution before the council that they pay mitigation to the business owners, to area residents, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4227.938s">And</a> the state came back to us unequivocally and stated they do not pay any mitigation on their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4235.601s">That</a> was a four-year hardship for the businesses in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4239.542s">So</a> I think we have to be mindful too that, you know, there may be projects in the community that won't pay any mitigation at all, but Mrs. Smith on Warren Street that's trying to do a utility to her house to improve something may be paying mitigation to get something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4257.39s">So</a> I think we have to be very mindful if we do support this here tonight, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4324.232s">Let's</a> send it somewhere else then, one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=4329.657s">Transportation</a> again?

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=19.093s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1590.96s">I</a> would support that increased notification <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1594.045s">as</a> well as adding all the other exemptions that currently exist as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1598.35s">So</a> it wouldn't be just the deferment that goes out, it'd be the senior property tax exemption, it would be the disabled property tax exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1608.22s">I</a> believe there's one for the blind, there's four or five of them out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1611.163s">So</a> I would ask that they all be sent out as well if that's all right.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1692.226s">This</a> is only a recommendation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1750.799s">Maybe</a> if he could send someone an email with his question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1754.2s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1754.64s">If</a> you'd like to send an email to the clerk or yourself or anyone he's familiar with.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2352.933s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2353.834s">I'm</a> just posing a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2355.774s">What</a> would prevent any retirement board currently from doing any different type of divestment they'd like to do?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2413.241s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could, I had the opportunity to talk to one of our local board members, and he said at this current point, if the board decided to divest in any different option that they chose, they would go to their advisor and choose to do so, and nothing would prohibit them from doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2433.89s">Unless</a> there was a conflict of interest of a board member, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2438.833s">And</a> that is a whole other ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2442.399s">I'm</a> not bringing that in, but that's a whole other ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2445.164s">So</a> I'm not sure quite what House 4440 does in <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2450.769s">moving</a> this issue forward, if we're really talking about, you know, investing in our planet and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2459.096s">I</a> think currently, these boards have the ability to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2463.039s">And</a> they can exercise that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2465.401s">So</a> I'm not quite sure what this does. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2467.603s">If</a> it's just a feel good type initiative, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2471.727s">But</a> I'm not sure what weight this really holds, to be quite honest with you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2515.277s">So</a> Mr. President, if I could, cause I feel that a number of emails and phone calls and in my conversations and back and forth with residents, I asked each resident if they were a member of the retirement board and quite to my amazement, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2533.67s">Not</a> one retiree or member of the current retirement board reached out to me to express their opinion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2541.873s">It</a> happened to be everyone outside of the retirement system and everyone's open to their own opinion, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2549.796s">But</a> I think we have to remember this is $182 million worth of assets for our retirees in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2558.199s">And</a> we have to be very mindful that any change <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2562.773s">could</a> have a potential impact on the investments that are being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2567.597s">And</a> the future of many retirees in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2572.582s">So</a> I think we have to be very mindful of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2576.065s">At</a> least I am before I take any action.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2605.33s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2605.65s">And</a> specifically, the language states fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2611.562s">So</a> you're making it sound like, oh, they can go off and do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2615.144s">But</a> the legislation specifically says fossil fuels and to divest from fossil fuels, which is Exxon, Chevron, British Petroleum, a lot of the major S&P. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2630.681s">bear</a> holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2632.022s">And</a> I think we have to be very careful because this will have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2636.883s">I</a> don't know if anyone could state what type of impact, but if we do move away from a certain energy, it will have an impact on retirees within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2648.948s">And</a> I think we have to be very mindful of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2652.83s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2863.81s">That's</a> a very appropriate term, putting your money where your mouth is, because in fiscal 20 of last year, the taxpayers in this community invested $12.2 million into the retirement system to make that system whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2879.123s">And</a> every year over the last 20-something years, Mr. President, the taxpayers have been supplementing <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2884.852s">the</a> retirement system to make it whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2887.374s">And,</a> uh, I'm not saying this is going to happen, but eventually when you do open the door, uh, you will be putting your money where your mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2896.063s">Um,</a> and the taxpayers will be paying the burden of that, Mr. President, as well as the retirees. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2902.228s">So</a> this doesn't just impact retirees. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2904.691s">It</a> impacts every taxpayer in this community down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2909.233s">potentially</a> could be paying additional money depending on what investments made, what diversity is done in regards to investments and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2920.799s">And</a> this could have a major impact, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2923.62s">So,</a> you know, the proponents of this would like you to believe that this is just another tool in the toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2930.146s">This</a> is the opening of the door, Mr. President, to now go and put pressure on our local boards, because that's the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2938.373s">The</a> next step is to go put pressure on the local board members to start making the changes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2944.393s">And</a> so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2945.634s">And</a> I applaud anyone that's working towards a cause, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2949.795s">But</a> I'm mindful of the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2952.997s">I'm</a> mindful of keeping a strong system. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2955.898s">Our</a> last five years, the return was 6.25 in our portfolio. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2961.36s">The</a> last three years was 8%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2964.001s">And</a> this year, before the issue that we're in, it was at 10.9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2971.798s">and</a> it's down very much from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2974.458s">But</a> I just want to state, Mr. President, based on what our portfolio has been over the last five years, any change could have a devastating impact, Mr. President, to the returns and to our retirees and to our taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2990.361s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4412.147s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4413.487s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4415.127s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4417.028s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4418.288s">I</a> just want to reflect the report that the fire department report says pending final inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4427.291s">So</a> I would ask that any approval of the council be contingent upon approval of final inspection by the fire department and the chief of the fire department.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5101.128s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5103.209s">I</a> think what this resolution is trying to accomplish is asking that the city council collaborate with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5111.379s">whether</a> it's a one-page document, whether it's through social media, whatever the avenue may be, I think what this resolution is trying to accomplish is saying, we're here to assist, we're here to help in any way we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5125.562s">So</a> I think that should be the message to the administration, and maybe not saying we need to put together a one-page document and so forth, but we want to be here to assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5136.844s">I</a> personally want to do a shout out to our colleague, Councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5141.323s">He's</a> been working the food lines, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5144.585s">He's</a> been giving seniors, picking up food, delivering it to their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5149.588s">He's</a> really been active on a level that I think is admirable to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5154.231s">And</a> I'd like to thank Councilor Caraviello in his own way, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5158.013s">And</a> I think that's what people are doing now in their own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5160.875s">They're</a> trying to assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5162.68s">And</a> as members of the council, I think we all want to assist the administration in helping get the message out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5168.706s">So</a> I support this, whether it's a document, whether it's anything, I support this and what it's trying to accomplish.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5468.344s">If</a> I could, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page then. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5472.303s">This</a> is not specifically asking for a one-page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5476.325s">We're</a> asking just that information and collaboration be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5481.067s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5526.428s">No,</a> I, you know, I don't think we have to put the delivery in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5529.709s">Let</a> the administration do their job and decide how they want to disseminate the information.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5984.737s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5985.838s">I'm</a> just a little confused on what exactly would go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5990.382s">You</a> know, this is the creation of a housing stability hotline. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5995.306s">It</a> also involves, I know, some other language regarding landlords and tenants and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6001.173s">I'm</a> not quite sure we were just discussing not confusing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6004.895s">And</a> now we're talking about adding document after document, sending it out to people, which I think may be very confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6012.639s">And</a> you're talking to someone that actually works in housing stabilization for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6018.522s">I</a> deal with thousands of homeless families on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6023.701s">And</a> this is something very near and dear to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6026.182s">But</a> I think what you have to do, Mr. President, is do it in a way that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6032.025s">And</a> if we're going to create a hotline and potentially even a task force, then I think we have to lay the foundation first. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6040.83s">You</a> have to crawl before you run. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6043.531s">And</a> I think we're trying to run first. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6045.392s">So</a> I think we should do our homework first and then look at disseminating information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6052.084s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6097.14s">Just</a> if I could I think we have to be mindful over the last several months We've sent dozens of requests to the city administration Working on a lot of different issues and requesting a lot of different things There's nothing that precludes of the council <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6114.693s">to</a> get together in a subcommittee or a committee that would be appropriate to the topic and discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6120.756s">We</a> can create a task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6122.757s">The</a> city administration doesn't have to create a task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6125.778s">We</a> as a council could do a lot of things legislatively and move issues forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6131.301s">And</a> I'm not saying I don't want to work with the city administration, but I just hate to see everything passed off to administration that's already in the midst of dealing with this horrible, uh, you know, Corona that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6144.907s">a</a> million things on their plate, and I just hate to say, well, here's another thing that we want you to do on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6151.991s">And</a> I'd like to see the council take control. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6155.493s">You</a> know, send it to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6157.794s">We</a> can call in all the different department heads and parties as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6161.856s">We</a> can unite this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6162.877s">We</a> can work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6164.558s">There's</a> really no need other than to get support from the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6169.372s">that</a> the council can't run with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6172.233s">So</a> I'd like to see more emphasis on the council and less emphasis on city administration, city administration, city administration, knowing that I believe they're already inundated and they're barely keeping their head above water now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6187.575s">And</a> to add another task is gonna be extremely difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6191.716s">It</a> may take their focus off something that is vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6196.777s">And</a> this is a very important issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6198.593s">but</a> I think we can accomplish this as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7768.363s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7770.004s">This</a> resolution is also open-ended as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7774.266s">And</a> who makes the determination when does this public health crisis end? <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7779.469s">Could</a> I be sitting in my apartment a year and a half from now stating that I don't believe that this crisis has ended yet, at least for my family or me in particular, based on my employment, based on a number of things? <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7793.198s">This</a> is a very slippery slope, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7795.542s">I</a> appreciate what Councilor Bears is trying to do, but this is a very slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7802.292s">I</a> think as was mentioned by some of the other councilors, this could be misinterpreted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7806.958s">in</a> many different ways, it's open-ended, and I don't believe it accomplishes what we're trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7812.903s">I</a> think if maybe we set forth something saying that for the next 30 days, we would hope that landlords and so forth will not evict anyone, then that's something that maybe we can hang our hat on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7828.735s">But</a> something open-ended, Mr. President, I cannot support here tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9421.965s">I</a> did, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9424.112s">I</a> just want to clarify the RAF program has existed for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9429.636s">Um,</a> this is not a COVID-19 RAF program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9434.1s">This</a> is additional money that's being given to the RAF program because of what we're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9439.764s">Um,</a> and every time, uh, every year about this time, actually, this supplemental money that's put into the RAF program, along with the home-based program and many other programs that assist <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9452.694s">low</a> income and residents that are maybe on the verge of losing their apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9460.081s">And</a> this is the time of year, religiously, that additional supplemental money is given. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9465.125s">So</a> I appreciate the fact that Councilor Bears offered this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9469.549s">I</a> can almost guarantee you that there will be additional money for raft, home base, and those other programs because of what's going on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9478.376s">And</a> I don't think us sending something to the state legislature in support of it would do any harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9485.638s">And</a> it can only do some good. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9487.859s">So</a> I would support this, Mr. President, in making sure, you know, this is the money that's, as Councilor Knight just alluded to, that's being sent to the most vulnerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9499.363s">So</a> if you're someone that's living day to day in a time like we're going through now, one paycheck could mean losing your apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9507.022s">And</a> so to many people, additional stimulus money, which I refer to as stimulus money, additional money for the RAF program may keep you in your apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9517.788s">If</a> you're homeless, home base may be the additional money that you need to get you into your own permanent housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9524.532s">So</a> these are all important programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9526.814s">And</a> the state legislature, as Councilor Bears probably knows, they usually only fund at 60, 70% at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9534.258s">And</a> then there's supplemental money that comes <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9536.659s">shortly</a> after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9537.94s">And</a> this is what we're seeing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9539.761s">And</a> I will support this tonight because it's a good measure in keeping those most vulnerable in our population in their apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9548.326s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9549.987s">Councilor</a> Bears, did you have a comment?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9844.383s">Offered</a> by President Falco and Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9847.844s">Be</a> it resolved that the administration update the city council <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9851.391s">as</a> to when peer consultants will be hired and what type of peer consultants will be hired to assist the city of Medford through the 40B process. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9860.54s">Council</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9978.087s">Move</a> for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9979.868s">Vice</a> President Caraviello.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10025.794s">On</a> the motion offered by Council President John Falco and Council Vice President Rick Caraviello as amended by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10035.381s">All</a> those in favor?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10046.705s">Roll</a> call on the B paper as offered by Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10051.648s">I</a> second that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10074.435s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10075.876s">Covering</a> the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion is adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10080.28s">Now</a> the main paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10085.084s">Is</a> the main paper seconded?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10111.492s">Seven</a> in the affirmative, none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10113.534s">The</a> motion is adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10114.474s">All</a> right, thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3EjMDeUU8A8/2024-11-19_3EjMDeUU8A8.html">City Council 03-31-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2090.744s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2091.845s">I</a> agree with council morale about design standards, and that's something that we should be exploring as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2098.21s">Uh,</a> when we do take a comprehensive look at our, uh, zoning ordinance, um, the six month moratorium that was stated, uh, in my opinion, uh, doesn't make any sense at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2111.461s">Uh,</a> because I think if we were to put a moratorium in place, um, it would be for a very <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2119.622s">finite</a> period of time, because we haven't looked at zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2124.125s">And</a> I think that's the next logical step. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2126.567s">So</a> I wouldn't support at this time any type of moratorium either. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2131.251s">I</a> think this all came about and this is no secret that over the last year or two, there's been a number of projects in the city where <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2138.817s">There's</a> been some questionable lots in the community that have expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2142.86s">And</a> I think that raised eyebrows in the community and some people concerned about what was happening in the community and didn't want to see the face of method change. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2154.112s">But</a> I agree with some logical standards regarding design review, a comprehensive approach to zoning that the council is going to be looking at hopefully very shortly, Mr. President, under your leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2168.326s">I</a> think we can move forward with a lot of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2171.95s">And</a> the last thing we want to do is curtail <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2175.429s">uh,</a> building and especially building that adds, uh, additional affordable units, potential in-law apartments, which no one wants to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2183.797s">But</a> I think that's another issue that I hear over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2187.38s">How</a> come I can't have someone, my mother that lives out in Cambridge, come and live with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2192.445s">And</a> I want to build a small in-law unit for her to live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2195.668s">that's</a> not a rental, and believe it or not, many of those get denied by the zoning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2201.612s">So</a> these are the issues I think we have to look at, but I cannot support this here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2207.416s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3422.846s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3424.046s">I'd</a> like to hear from Mr. Sandoval just to, uh, regarding his business and, uh, if he would have a problem with closing at one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3433.608s">Mr.</a> Sandoval.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3453.179s">So</a> based on Mr. Sandoval, based on what Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello mentioned, I would too support the one o'clock closing.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3563.754s">Just</a> based on the 90-day review, which I support, we know this business has been opening for probably about a year and a half now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3572.241s">So</a> I would just state that if we are gonna put a review, that it commenced with the day of opening and not the day of the issuance of this extended hours of operation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4066.219s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4068.639s">Will</a> the street be closed off for any particular reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4072.921s">And</a> how long, roughly, will this construction take?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4089.767s">And</a> what type of sidewalk currently exists there? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4092.288s">Is</a> it asphalt or cement?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4121.854s">Right,</a> and the pole itself is located on Middlesex Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4126.055s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4127.656s">Yep,</a> it's on the sidewalk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4770.576s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4772.337s">Roughly,</a> how long will this project take?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4785.713s">And</a> will the primary work be done during the day?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4832.851s">As</a> you may or may not know, Dan, there's been an issue with construction along the Green Line extension and trains that are going through at night at two, three in the morning have to sound their horn when they go through a construction area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4847.379s">And</a> that's been causing a lot of problems in the Salt Method area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4850.321s">I</a> don't think this will have any impact, but I didn't know if the work that's being done there will affect the trains that are going through.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6458.005s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6459.846s">I</a> saw recently in one of the governor's speeches that he stated that the housing court, Massachusetts Housing Court, would not be considering any evictions or foreclosures. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6472.632s">I</a> don't know the exact time frame that he gave, but he did say that they weren't going to entertain that subject at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6481.236s">And</a> I know that involves a large measure of what Councilor Bears is talking about.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7551.656s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7553.598s">I</a> think time is of the essence with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7556.521s">And</a> I would highly recommend that we use our bully pulpit as this meeting to alert residents to call their state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7566.568s">To</a> be quite honest with you, I think it's important that when a rep receives, I used to work for a state rep, when you receive 800 phone calls rather than a letter from the Medford City Council, that goes a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7579.699s">So</a> I would urge anyone that's tuning in right now, anyone that's watching, if you haven't picked up the phone, if you haven't sent your state rep an email, let them know where you stand on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7589.607s">That's,</a> you know, because time is of the essence and it's important that we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7594.469s">And</a> I agree with my colleagues, you know, I think this is an important issue, but I also think it has to be properly vetted before we give it a stamp of approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7605.472s">And,</a> you know, I have some issues with, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7609.208s">If</a> Councilor Bears came out and said house docket four nine three five like we do on many other things that City Council supports that You know that may be a different issue, but they came out with other items that I'm in that particular docket I assume the amendments that council beers offered with things that weren't part of that house docket and <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7630.362s">So</a> that adds a whole other layer of complexity on something that's already a complex issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7635.904s">And</a> I think it takes it too far to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7639.805s">I</a> probably would support just voting for House Dock at 4935, saying that we approve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7646.486s">But</a> now you add all these other amendments into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7648.947s">That's</a> a whole other issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7650.047s">I</a> think that merits discussion.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8212.476s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8215.158s">I</a> know Mayor Lungo-Koehn has been working on <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8219.854s">sanitizing</a> many of our public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8223.017s">I</a> think what Councilor Scarpelli mentioned about the vehicles is an excellent idea and one that needs to be added to the sanitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8231.623s">So</a> I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli offering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8235.666s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8948.648s">I</a> have not seen it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8949.768s">I</a> haven't looked at my emails in quite some time because we've been in meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8953.169s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9500.898s">And</a> if, if, you know, make a recommendation rather than withdraw, why don't we just send this paper to a company, the paper, the council vice president put forward already. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9513.206s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10384.707s">While</a> we're on the suspension, if I could just bring up, uh, we had a recent loss of, uh, a long time method resident, Sam Musto, uh, family man, father. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10395.207s">just</a> dedicated to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10397.43s">And</a> he recently passed a long time labor in the community, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_WYTf73F7sag/2024-11-19_WYTf73F7sag.html">City Council 03-10-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2000.098s">Mr.</a> President, while we're in the suspension.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2004.399s">Paper</a> 20-094.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2039.896s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2041.376s">I</a> put this on tonight's agenda because I had several residents that reside in condos, in particular Maple Park condominiums that reached out to me recently regarding waste pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2058.944s">And</a> they asked me the question, which I've actually received over the years from other condo people in the community, why don't they pick up my trash, the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2070.847s">We</a> pay the same tax rate that any other good paying taxpayer pays in this community, and we don't get trash service. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2080.088s">So</a> I did a little homework, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2082.249s">We</a> have probably about eight or nine residents from Maple Park, and I appreciate they all came out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2088.527s">because</a> this issue is very important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2091.708s">But</a> I did a little homework, Mr. President, pulled out the contract that was signed by the city of Medford and Waste Management back in August of 2010, August 25th to be precise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2108.552s">It</a> was a ten year contract which actually ends this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2112.453s">And</a> it's my understanding in talking to DPW, what resulted from the contract back in 2010 was the city went around to all the different condo associations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2124.617s">And</a> they touched base with each condo association, saying, we're signing an agreement with waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2130.259s">It's</a> going to be a 10-year agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2132.339s">Are</a> you interested, as an association, to have either recycle or trash pickup at your building? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2141.688s">And</a> for a number of different reasons, many associations said, you know what, we are interested in having both. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2148.556s">And</a> the city added their condo to the contract, which I have a copy of all the condominium associations and whether or not they get trash, recycle, a combination or none. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2162.43s">And</a> so at the time, they went around to all the condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2165.634s">Some</a> condos, like Maple Park Condo, opted at the time not to do trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2173.962s">They</a> currently have recycle pickup, but not trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2177.954s">And</a> it was based on, I guess, the board of directors of the condo association, and they decided not to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2189.985s">But</a> within the contract, Mr. President, and I won't read it, it's a lengthy contract, but on page six of the contract under section 12, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2200.532s">It</a> states the contractors shall collect refuse weekly and recyclables every other week from condominiums as listed on exhibit D. And that's what I refer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2212.201s">Exhibit</a> D shows you all the different condo buildings and whether or not they have recycle or trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2219.815s">It</a> says, Exhibit D, as from time to time may be amended subject to compensation as specified in Section 23.3, condominiums will be required to provide rubbish dumpster and recycling cots compatible with contractor's vehicles at their own cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2239.779s">Condominiums</a> that require services greater than specified herein will be directed to purchase additional service <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2248.061s">outside</a> of this agreement from a vendor of their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2251.843s">So</a> at the time, Mr. President, Maple Park Condo, and like I said, there are other condos that are in the same boat, decided not to do the trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2261.488s">And</a> then some years later, they say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2264.389s">At</a> this point, we'd like to start trash pickup with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2267.871s">And</a> I'm being told from the DPW department that in order to do so, if Maple Park wanted to join the contract, they can do it one of two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2280.323s">They</a> can ask during budget period, which is coming up very shortly, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2285.007s">to</a> have the city, because we have a fixed amount every year that we put into the waste management contract, and if we were going to bring on a new condo association, that would increase the contract amount, naturally, that we would have to add to the budget based on the newcomers into the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2304.685s">So</a> that would be the first way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2306.346s">If</a> Maple Park and other condos said, you know what, we'd be interested now in joining, please sign us up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2313.51s">The</a> city would have to make compensation within the budget to account for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2317.992s">The</a> second way, Mr. President, is the way of <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2322.214s">The</a> contract ends in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2323.695s">So</a> it ends this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2325.475s">It's</a> a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2326.936s">It</a> ends this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2328.556s">And</a> I'm not sure how this new administration will go about doing this, but I would assume it might be similar to what they did 10 years ago and reach out once again to all the condo associations in the city and saying, would you like to participate? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2343.802s">And</a> we can gather a new list at the end of this contract, which is this year, and have the city fund this brand new list. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2353.707s">I'm</a> being told also in the past, over the last ten years, based on a by request, the past mayors <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2363.431s">If</a> an association went to the previous mayors, they would make their case for why they need recycling or trash pickup through the city, and the mayor would grant it or not grant it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2373.979s">And</a> I've been told that in the past, there have been condo associations that have been granted this additional pickup service through the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2384.666s">So</a> I'm offering tonight, Mr. President, a way that not only Maple Park, but the other condominium associations that I have on this particular list, like Craddock Cove, I think the Regency Condo, Wellington Condo, there's a number of other condos in the city that may opt to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2407.523s">So</a> I'm asking through this resolution, and I'd like to hear from some of the residents also, Mr. President, that the mayor determine how she wants to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2416.596s">If</a> she wants to do it in this year's budget, we have to make sure that the condos that want to participate <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2424.486s">make</a> it known and that we add that to the budget or if the mayor feels best that we wait out the five or six or seven months that are left in this 10-year contract and then just see if anyone else wants to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2437.795s">That</a> may be an easier way, Mr. President, but I'll leave that up to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2442.038s">That's</a> not up to me to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2444.079s">But</a> based on my findings, Mr. President, the contract, in my opinion, does call for allowing newcomers into the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2454.642s">And</a> it does state there'll be an associated cost for a newcomer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2458.983s">It</a> also states if you have a large condo and you need more than the one pickup, which may be the case in some of the larger condos, that that's added at your own expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2469.245s">And</a> that's spelled out in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2472.179s">But</a> my hope tonight, Mr. President, is really to put everyone on the same playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2477.3s">You</a> know, we all pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2478.721s">I've</a> had people in the past say, I pay taxes for school, but I have no school-aged kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2483.302s">That's</a> not how we work in the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2486.603s">We</a> all pay a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2488.003s">We</a> all should receive the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2489.863s">And</a> there's no reason why the condo associations and people that live in condos and pay the same tax shouldn't get that same service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2500.626s">Another</a> issue too, Mr. President, if you don't have trash pickup, you're not eligible for bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2507.993s">So</a> someone that lives in a condo that wants to dispose of a bureau or a mattress or something, they're not eligible for the pickup that every other resident is eligible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2519.284s">And</a> that's unfair too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2520.985s">So</a> I'll have residents, one resident told me he had to take his mattress over to his friend's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2527.247s">This</a> gentleman is not a spring chicken, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2529.971s">And</a> to have him get in his car and bring his mattress over to a friend's house is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2535.138s">And</a> they should be added, Mr. President, as well to the bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2538.622s">So</a> I'd like to hear with some of, I know Cindy Watson's here, with a number of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2543.909s">And</a> I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that either suggestion be entertained by the mayor to ensure that Maple Park Condo and any other condo in the city that opts to enter into the program is able to do so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2908.64s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2911.683s">I</a> think part of the issue, from my understanding of talking to DPW, is that the city pays hundreds of thousands of dollars a year just for the bulk pickup contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2923.511s">And</a> at some point, it was determined that if you didn't have trash pickup, that you weren't going to be eligible for bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2931.676s">And</a> I'm not sure where that decision was made, if it was a unilateral decision or what. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2936.74s">I</a> didn't see it in the contract, but I was told by DPW, if you don't have trash pickup, they're not going to pick up bulk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2943.766s">And</a> I think that was a way of trimming down the exorbitant cost of the bulk items. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2951.132s">I</a> believe they said they paid $22 an item in the city for bulk pickup, and it's unlimited. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2958.531s">They</a> only do it during the recycle period, so it's every two weeks they do the bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2963.476s">But</a> I think that was a way of cutting cost, and that may have been when they cut the service off to Maple Park during that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2970.304s">I'm</a> not sure exactly when it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2972.386s">But</a> the reason why I brought up, Mr. President, is to ask these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2976.676s">And</a> have the administration, we have the chief of staff here, Dave Rodriguez, who I'm sure will take this back to the mayor regarding this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2984.882s">Mr.</a> President, and we'll be able to get an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2987.563s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2990.005s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3023.278s">We</a> can offer those two different options to make, because it could be done in other ways, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3029.163s">Those</a> are the two that were stated to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3032.226s">Adding</a> to this year's budget, or when the contract turns out, which is at the end of this year, that all the economy associations be out with their options.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3746.735s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3748.498s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3749.84s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3751.483s">The</a> Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, you guys continue to produce. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3757.791s">It's</a> one after another after another. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3760.793s">It's</a> very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3762.794s">And</a> I like the fact that you're getting donations, you're soliciting organizations, and you're doing it on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3770.837s">You're</a> not saying, hey, how can you help or do this for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3773.759s">You're</a> taking the initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3775.3s">And</a> I think that goes a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3777.541s">I,</a> too, would like to see, you mentioned Morrison Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3780.662s">potentially</a> doing this in some other parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3783.784s">We</a> in the city of Medford are very fortunate to have so many beautiful parks within our neighborhoods, many of which I believe are underutilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3793.289s">And</a> to introduce something like the arts and attracting people to the parks, I think goes a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3800.313s">And</a> I appreciate all the effort that you've both put into this, as well as all of your fellow students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3805.236s">I</a> thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5856.964s">I</a> was not under the impression we were voting for a rule change, so I may have missed that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5885.301s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5887.441s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5889.041s">The</a> reason why I state that, I don't know, I was under the impression this was going the way of every other request, either sending it to the Rules Committee or being properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5898.683s">And</a> I really don't think this has been properly vetted, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5902.324s">I</a> think it has all good intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5904.905s">However,</a> Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5906.645s">The</a> filing of a petition by a resident is requesting council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5915.268s">And</a> it is, it complies with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5919.689s">It</a> appears on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5921.89s">And</a> from what I gather from this, it does state the following petition shall be reserved only for matters requiring council action per law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5933.171s">So</a> there may be an item when someone's coming up for council help, but it's not a requirement of the council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5943.962s">Not</a> as was stated, special permits, grants of location, sign variance, those require council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5951.49s">There's</a> no way around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5953.416s">So</a> I think this is kind of a slippery slope, Mr. President, that it limits speech of residents that want to come up and not only come up like they would under suspension, which gives zero notification, but give proper notification and look for council relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5973.925s">And</a> that council relief may not be something that's under our jurisdiction, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5981.257s">But</a> something that residents feel that they can get relief from the council by coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5986.442s">And</a> I don't want to limit that, Mr. President, and I think this language would limit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5991.547s">So</a> I cannot support that, Mr. President, unless this is properly vetted out to make sure that we're not limiting residents in the ability to come up here and speak or file a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6003.49s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6278.708s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6280.59s">So</a> this is petitions, presentation, and similar papers, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6286.595s">This</a> is what the section it falls under. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6292.708s">So</a> if someone wants to come up and make a presentation that the council has no bearing on, that would come under public participation or petitions, presentations, and similar papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6305.152s">Or</a> are we amending or eventually going to amend this to have what my colleagues are stating, having the agenda coincide with what we're trying to do?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6386.866s">So</a> is the issue that it's assigned a number? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6389.808s">Is</a> that what the issue is?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6418.427s">But</a> there's a distinction between a resolution and a petition, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6425.72s">Only</a> a council can file something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6426.661s">Receive</a> and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6428.302s">This</a> council's been doing that for 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6430.564s">And</a> that's how we dispose of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6431.885s">So</a> if someone comes up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6433.386s">If</a> someone comes up and it has no bearing on the council, Mr. President, or doesn't require a council vote, you'll hear that saying all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6440.452s">Receive</a> and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6442.874s">I</a> just feel that this is, Mr. President, a way of restricting people from coming up, putting something which is valid on the agenda, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6452.641s">it</a> gets signed the number as a petition, not as a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6456.404s">It's</a> a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6457.425s">They're</a> two very different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6458.906s">And</a> a petition is requesting council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6461.849s">Now,</a> if they put something on the agenda that they believe requires council action and it doesn't, that's when the council can make a decision to receive and place on file or state clearly that this doesn't require council action and hear out whatever their concern is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6478.102s">I</a> just don't see the reason <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6480.484s">to</a> eliminate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6481.725s">I</a> really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6483.707s">I</a> don't see the reasoning behind that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6485.608s">I</a> don't see how that, how does that increase public participation or make it easier? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6490.212s">Can</a> anyone state that to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6491.353s">How</a> does this make it easier for public participation?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6497.118s">How?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6497.979s">How?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6498.439s">If</a> someone can explain that to me, by eliminating this, the ability for some resident to come up and put this in advance on the agenda, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6507.014s">So</a> it's open and notorious, and everyone knows what they want to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6511.639s">I</a> don't see how that, Mr. President, this enhances anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6517.918s">warrants</a> additional discussion rather than just approving a council rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6523.122s">It's</a> not often in my years on the council that you ever see a council rule come up, Mr. President, and approve the same night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6530.887s">I</a> can't recall the last time it happened, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6533.328s">It</a> doesn't happen often. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6534.809s">And</a> I think this hasn't been properly vetted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6538.132s">And</a> I realize that we're looking to address our maybe open meeting violations and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6547.998s">I'm</a> not sure this accomplishes anything in that realm, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6552.239s">And,</a> you know, I've heard people say this doesn't do anything to decrease public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6558.4s">What</a> does it do to increase public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6562.401s">I</a> haven't heard that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6622.106s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6623.976s">If</a> I could, and this is, I'm not directing this at Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6628.598s">I'm</a> not taking it that way at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6629.979s">I</a> just want to, council rules are very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6632.02s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6632.44s">And</a> I want to make sure that they're properly vetted and you know, public participation as Councilor Knight said, you can come up at any time and speak on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6642.537s">However,</a> what wasn't stated is now under the open meeting law, Mr. President, you may be able to come up, but the council cannot deliberate now under the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6652.541s">So</a> if a resident wants to come up and speak on an issue, someone popped up tonight and wanted to speak on an issue, we can hear them out, Mr. President, but we can't deliberate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6663.065s">We</a> cannot until they're placed on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6665.566s">Hence.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6667.284s">Petitions,</a> presentations, and similar matters appears on the agenda, gives the 48-hour notice that's required by the open meeting law and the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6676.591s">Hence,</a> we can deliberate on something they're discussing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6680.693s">They're</a> two completely different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6683.766s">So</a> if the council feels comfortable with doing away with a section of our agenda that allows people to come up and pre-advance, put on the agenda what they want to speak about, and hopefully have the council deliberate on it, that's petitions, presentations, and similar matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6703.254s">If</a> we want to do away with that and say, you know what, the only one that can offer that now is anyone having business that deals with signage and so forth that requires a council vote, or variances, or whatever it might be, that's very different, Mr. President, than a resident coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6722.689s">So</a> if we eliminate residents from coming up under this section and require them to come under public participation, we may be telling residents that come up <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6731.977s">We</a> can't deliberate tonight, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6734.019s">We'll</a> see you next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6734.939s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6792.635s">Mr.</a> President, so effectively, you're going to have someone in the city clerk's office, with all due respect, making that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6799.0s">Whether</a> it falls under the criteria, which was based over here, limited to special permits, grants, locations, sign variance, and common vituals license, only petitions filed meeting this criteria shall be assigned a council paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6813.67s">All</a> other petitions shall be placed on the public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6817.213s">So</a> in effect, what we're doing is having the city clerk's office figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6821.736s">what's</a> going to be a petition and what's not a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6824.797s">And</a> that goes under public participation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6907.871s">I</a> was just wondering maybe if the council defined this petition was that where was that definition is that just part of our rules or is that part of a definition?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6930.014s">Right,</a> so that definition is not a legal definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6933.035s">It's</a> a definition that was created by a legislature somewhere, a town council, board of aldermen, someone that said that only a petition is defined as a council action that only requires action by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6948.441s">So</a> that's just a made up, that's a made up term, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6957.069s">A</a> petition is exactly what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6959.07s">It's</a> requesting the council to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6961.33s">Why</a> does it have to be something that's required by law? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6967.432s">I</a> don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6969.013s">To</a> me, that limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6970.373s">Why</a> do we want to limit people to come up? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6972.514s">This</a> is the only... Point of information, council and I. It's about stuff that requires the council to take action.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7515.387s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7516.307s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7519.029s">If</a> Mr. Krause came up tonight and wanted to do what Councilor Knight was talking about, and he is not in any violation because the open meeting law only applies to deliberative bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7531.852s">Mr.</a> Krause wouldn't be in any violation of bringing up the issue, so he can appear before us and bring up the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7538.293s">However,</a> we would be in violation by deliberating saying, you know what, Mr. Krause, that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7544.854s">That's</a> asked the mayor to get 20,000 for the school board. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7548.274s">So</a> that's why I'm saying, Mr. President, having something, if I could just finish, having something assigned a petition number, Mr. President, is a way of getting around, because a lot of people will come up, Mr. President, and want to speak before us that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7562.708s">And</a> they're not in violation, we would be in violation for deliberating. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7566.671s">And</a> I think what Mr. Krause raises is a valid point, even with the numbering. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7570.675s">I</a> think that's a great idea, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7574.359s">I</a> think having the ability to do that and also having public participation, that to me opens up the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7581.167s">Eliminating</a> one is exactly what it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7583.269s">It</a> eliminates the option. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7585.071s">And</a> I don't see how that is open and transparent and adds to discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7589.516s">I</a> really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7590.337s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7590.637s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7617.005s">Not</a> if they were allowed to do a petition.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7662.253s">So</a> we're no longer a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7663.454s">We're</a> individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7664.554s">When</a> someone comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7665.655s">Well,</a> I'm going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7666.456s">No,</a> no, I'm going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7667.296s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7668.157s">You</a> can do whatever action you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7669.659s">You're</a> an individual Councilor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7950.463s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7951.724s">I</a> just want to echo my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7954.266s">Mrs.</a> Morris was the matriarch of the family and truly was someone that had strong moral values. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7966.315s">And</a> as Councilor Knight mentioned, raised two boys that really impeccable people of character and she will be sorely missed.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8811.184s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8813.385s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8814.726s">I</a> appreciate the fact that Councilman Knight's trying to get creative with the concern about potential loss on street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8823.489s">However,</a> it flies in the face of everything I've spoken about over the last several years regarding properties on Salem Street and Riverside Ave that have turned their front yards into parking lots, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8837.054s">And</a> I don't think it's very pleasing aesthetically, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8842.457s">And</a> I would hate to see a practice, any practice that promotes such, even though it's called inner core and sounds great, the inner core is the outer core of our city and how our city looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8855.746s">And</a> I don't think it does anything for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8858.627s">So</a> I would not support this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8860.689s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8862.99s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9528.439s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9529.339s">Mr.</a> President, we actually have our first request for a suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9533.68s">A</a> resident that's here tonight would like to speak on crosswalks on Salem Street, which he considers a public safety concern.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1917.955s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1918.435s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2046.165s">Thank</a> you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2047.826s">I</a> was contacted recently through email by a Medford resident who was concerned about airplane noise over the city of Medford like many other residents and he asked that I use this council forum to reiterate the fact that last year Medford filed over 700 complaints to Massport regarding airplane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2071.54s">And</a> based on the number of complaints, it's our belief through our representatives, Peter Hauk and Luke Presner, that the more complaints we file with Massport for Medford citizens regarding the noise, that Massport and the FAA may take a longer look at our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2091.069s">So</a> he asked me if I could just reiterate the contact numbers at Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2095.971s">And</a> I told him I'd do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2097.512s">If</a> someone wants to make a complaint to Massport regarding airplane noise by phone, it's 617-561-3333. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2110.282s">And</a> if you want to do it online, it's www.massport.com backslash loganairport backslash aboutlogan backslash noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2127.038s">And</a> if you want to do it online by Air Noise mobile friendly web, it's an application or a button subscription, it's HTPS double backslash airnoise.io. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2142.477s">And</a> those are the three ways residents can file a complaint, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2146.88s">There</a> is that button subscription that I'm not familiar with, but I know Medford residents carried around with them, and when they hear excessive noise, they press a button and it logs in a complaint automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2158.347s">And</a> I forget what the app costs it may be ten or fifteen dollars for the year But it's very helpful and the more complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2164.951s">We</a> log mr. President the more our concerns will be heard by Massport and FAA I appreciate you taking the time off for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2171.774s">Thank</a> you counsel marks the other thing I wanted to mention mr. President briefly and we just had our <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2179.278s">This</a> past Sunday, a community volunteer initiative that started at Medford High School, the main entrance of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2188.889s">There</a> is a committee called Medford Beautification Committee, which organized an event this past Sunday from 8 to 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2196.618s">to</a> paint the front foyer of Medford High School, to spruce it up a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2200.861s">The</a> co-chairs are Larry White and Bill Carr Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2204.323s">They</a> organized, must have been 75 people that showed up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2209.246s">A</a> lot of local volunteers, a lot of businesses, which I'd like to name just a few, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2215.33s">I</a> think it's always helpful to let people feel that when they come out and help out, <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2220.933s">that</a> they are involved and they are doing something good to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2225.698s">Lou</a> and John Iantoppa from Iantoppa Painting did tremendous work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2230.763s">John</a> McLaughlin, who's the Director of Buildings and Grounds along with his staff did excellent work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2237.11s">Red's</a> Painting, <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2239.452s">Magnificent</a> Muffin donated coffee and muffins. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2243.057s">Modern</a> Hardware donated the Mustang blue paint, which from what I'm told is a specialized paint that is painted dark blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2253.689s">Ryan</a> Tate, project supervisor for select paints and finishes, donated all the materials and painting stuff for the entire event. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2263.757s">I</a> witnessed Mayor Lungo-Koehn painting herself, Mr. President, the stairway. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2268.401s">It</a> was very tedious work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2270.263s">Superintendent</a> Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vinson was using a roller. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2274.707s">She</a> seemed to be a master with the roller. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2277.068s">School</a> committee members Kathy Kreatz, Melanie McLaughlin, Paul Rousseau, <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2281.652s">and</a> Paulette Van der Kloot were also pretty handy with the paintbrushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2286.595s">Hank</a> Morris, Fred Roach, Neil Osborne here from City Hall, Ricky Harris, Rich Lavoie, Steven and John Pompeo, Chris Donovan, Sean Caron, Ed and Susan Lungo, and a number of volunteers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2299.704s">It</a> was just a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2301.165s">It</a> showed a lot of community pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2302.886s">This</a> is the first of many projects that this beautification committee is going to start working on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2309.39s">It's</a> all volunteers, it's all donations, and it really was a win-win for the community of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2316.377s">And</a> I want to thank everyone that showed up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3863.188s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3863.968s">Counsel</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3865.369s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3866.289s">Cheryl,</a> I had just a question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3868.81s">When</a> the building commissioner came out regarding the lot coverage, he has not responded since?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3896.773s">Because</a> you're 100% correct, that should be before the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3901.275s">So</a> they should require a variance if what you're stating is correct, and it exceeds the law coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3907.279s">That</a> does require Zoning Board of Appeals, and also would trigger public hearings, so neighbors would be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3916.045s">So</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3917.767s">You</a> bring up some great points regarding mitigation for dust, debris, dirt. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3922.711s">I</a> agree with you 1,000%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3924.732s">If</a> someone's working directly next door to you, there's no reason they should be throwing stuff out and impacting your quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3931.578s">And</a> if they do, they should be able to mitigate it to keep the dust and dirt and debris down and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3936.282s">So</a> that's a great suggestion when we eventually start fine tuning zoning and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3943.285s">The</a> digging or excavating does require fencing off. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3947.507s">I</a> just went through something up in North Method where a developer came in, started digging a giant hole, left it there right in the middle of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3955.27s">I</a> reached out to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3957.211s">They</a> required them to go out and put one of those plastic, you know, four or five foot fences around the perimeter. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3963.774s">And</a> I don't think that's zoning, I think that's according to building code. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3967.318s">So</a> they did go out and rectify that, and they should do that with your fence.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3972.423s">I'm</a> not sure why you didn't call a lawyer if they knocked your fence down, but that's another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3977.848s">Because</a> they should be responsible for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3980.491s">The</a> length of a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3982.332s">That</a> is an excellent point that you brought up, because there should be some definitive answer when someone comes in and says, I have a request to do x, y, and z on this particular property. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3995.327s">You</a> get a permit for a length of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3997.63s">And</a> that length of time shouldn't exceed anything that's longer than a standard period. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4002.674s">So</a> if they're doing renovation to the exterior house and that takes three months, it should be expected to be done in three months, not a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4009.859s">So</a> you shouldn't have to live next to an active construction zone for that length of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4014.403s">I'm</a> going to check into that just to see if there's anything on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4017.825s">Because</a> I've driven by that place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4021.548s">It</a> looks like the Adams family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4024.47s">It's</a> awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4026.394s">It</a> really is awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4028.056s">And</a> what else? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4030.818s">I</a> think that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4031.638s">But</a> I will check into the length of time, and I appreciate your comments on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4036.081s">I'm</a> sorry you have to go through this, but hopefully Paul Moky will give you some relief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4095.001s">But</a> that's the city's responsibility for notification of the residents.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4107.856s">We</a> should be relying on a private contractor to notify our taxpaying residents whether a city street's going to be closed or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4115.24s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4116.0s">The</a> city street is a city street, and they have to get permission to close the city street.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4131.44s">That's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4132.561s">That's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4134.703s">Councilor</a> Bears.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4633.516s">I</a> think this matter would probably be appropriate for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4636.319s">That's</a> what I'm thinking as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4637.52s">It</a> seems to be police in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4639.541s">So</a> I think the correct avenue is that we could also notify through our channels the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4647.848s">Maybe</a> they could do some mediation or see what's going on.

Street, which includes Hastings Lane, Mystic Street, and Walcott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2774.943s">And</a> some of the updates they're looking about curb extensions, bump outs, pedestrian lights in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2783.71s">As</a> part of this project, we were told by <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2787.238s">Mass</a> Department of Transportation, that there will also be some land takings in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2794.463s">And</a> the City of Medford is now reaching out to many of the homeowners along High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2801.008s">In</a> addition, Mr. President, there is also going to be a bike lane that will be put on the southbound side of High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2812.424s">And</a> the bike lane goes from Auburn Street all the way up to Woburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2819.248s">And</a> it starts and ends in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2825.711s">On</a> the other side of the street, they will have a lane that could be used, I guess, for both bikes and cars mutually. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2833.998s">Just</a> recently, Mr. President, the Traffic Commission also held a meeting because approval would be required by the Traffic Commission to eliminate some of the spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2845.662s">We</a> were told at last week's meeting, last Wednesday, that they numbered out the spots to be 60 on-street parking spots from Auburn Street all the way up to Hastings Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2861.067s">And</a> of the 60, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2863.467s">19,</a> according to their numbers, were going to be eliminated on the southbound side. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2871.17s">Now,</a> over the last week, Mr. President, I, like many members behind this reel, have received a number of phone calls, residents that did attend the 2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2882.153s">Traffic</a> Commission meeting and <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2886.624s">They</a> weren't quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2888.345s">They</a> thought they were going there to listen to a presentation about this new Safe Routes project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2895.09s">And</a> unbeknownst to them, there was an actual vote taken by the Traffic Commission to eliminate spots in front of people's homes that have been there for four, five, six decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2909.501s">I</a> don't think anyone behind this reel <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2911.763s">is</a> against safe routes, and I think I could speak for my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2915.684s">I</a> think we all welcome that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2917.204s">We</a> all welcome state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2919.205s">Anytime</a> you can get additional funding, that's great, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2922.706s">But</a> I do have concerns, Mr. President, that this project may not move forward if we're not able to reach a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2931.36s">And</a> I think the best way to do it is at this point, where it's still in the early stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2936.322s">And</a> I'm formally requesting tonight that we ask our city engineer to go back to the Department of Transportation regarding the southbound bike lane that only is about two city, three city blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2952.129s">That</a> they revisit the elimination, Mr. President, of those spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2958.172s">to</a> accommodate a five foot bike lane that leads to nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2963.894s">It</a> ends, it starts, it ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2966.734s">And</a> like I said, three city blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2969.275s">And</a> we were told that the Department of Transportation will only entertain projects and only fund projects if it includes bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2980.477s">But</a> in my opinion, Mr. President, it makes no sense to have a bike lane that doesn't continue on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2987.479s">I</a> asked a question that night, well, if it stops all the way up at Hastings Lane, where does the bike go after that? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2996.642s">And</a> they said the bike will continue to ride on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3000.19s">Because</a> under the laws of Massachusetts, bikes and cars are allowed to have equal access to the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3012.192s">So</a> I think we can head this off, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3015.013s">I</a> don't want to be at the last minute attending to neighborhood concerns when they're going to be asking for a vote of this council to improve land takings, which will make the project even go further down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3027.235s">So</a> I would ask at this point that we intervene, we send a letter to our city engineer, let him know that we feel more comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3036.118s">that</a> the project, while it's in the early stages, be revisited to add those 19 spots that we're going to lose and come out with another solution that doesn't impact parking, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3051.592s">Many</a> of the residents were told, well, if you live on a high street and they're removing that spot, just park across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3057.988s">And</a> one of the residents that called me said, well, my 80-year-old mother really shouldn't be crossing a very busy street that you're already saying this concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3068.248s">and</a> having her walk another 300 yards to maybe get up to the pedestrian light to cross over to get to her house, where we've had this spot in front of my house for five decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3079.371s">So</a> I can see where they're coming from, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3081.691s">Other</a> residents on Mystic Street that contacted me were concerned that by eliminating these particular spots, especially next to the Brooks School, that you're just going to take people that are regularly parking on High Street and push them into the secondary roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3097.375s">which</a> I think is a concern for residents already in a busy area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3103.439s">So</a> I would ask that in the form of a motion that we send it to the city engineer and have him contact DOT regarding the bike lane and other options available so we can continue to have the 60 spots that residents count on right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3120.69s">in</a> a very cramped area, not just because of the school, because of the public transportation in the West Method area, because it's right out of the business district in West Method, and that area is very congested as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3134.557s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3541.33s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3542.691s">You</a> know, the report that was done spoke about the number of spots and how their utilization rate is pretty low in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3553.335s">Anyone</a> that would drive, I don't know when they did this report, I don't know who did the study, but anyone that's familiar with that area would know the southbound, maybe not all the way up to Auburn Street, but further down, is always packed with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3566.581s">So</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3568.142s">Secondly,</a> Mr. President, has there been any report or indication how many bikes are actually using this particular area? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3577.027s">I</a> haven't heard anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3578.888s">And</a> to me, to have a bike lane that ends at the top of Auburn and then going down a windy rest of a high street is <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3588.873s">far</a> more of a public safety concern when that lane ends, Mr. President, than having a fake lane for three city blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3596.779s">And</a> I think the area that would be a concern is not in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3601.483s">It</a> would be what happens after that, Mr. President, because the bike lane ends, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, right where the new intersection will be with Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3611.861s">So</a> they're creating a new island there that's going to be like a fork in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3615.343s">That's</a> where my problem is with this particular bike lane, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3620.845s">I</a> think you're setting up bike riders for failure in this particular area with a false sense of security. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3627.268s">That's</a> all I wanted to add, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3813.28s">I</a> just want to clarify, it's not a separated lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3817.563s">That's</a> a big clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3820.626s">It's</a> its own lane, but it's not a separated lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3823.188s">It's</a> not separated by anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3825.907s">It's</a> its own lane, but there's a distinction.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4134.75s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4135.671s">And</a> that was when I made my opening statement to see if we can come up with an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4140.333s">And</a> it's our job as elected officials to also represent the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4144.995s">And</a> I think that's what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4146.276s">And</a> the reason why I brought it up now, Mr. President, so we wouldn't be bringing the issue up at the last hour when everything is all set in stone, all the land takings are signed off, and then they need a vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4157.622s">This</a> gives them ample time to revisit the process, Mr. President, and find out what we can do to accommodate the residents that have a hardship, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4167.224s">That's</a> all we're asking here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4168.684s">We're</a> not asking to stop the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4171.184s">We're</a> not asking to give money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4173.445s">You</a> know, that's a red herring. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4174.585s">No</a> one's asking for that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4176.745s">We're</a> asking to safeguard residents that contact us and have every right to do so because it's a quality of life issue that's impacting them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4186.674s">You</a> know, so any project worth its weight, Mr. President, needs to be properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4191.238s">The</a> fact that the state may come in and say, well, the federal government, this is how it's going to work, that's fine for them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4197.683s">Then</a> it's up to us as a community to stand up and say, this works for us, and then comes for a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4203.307s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4204.888s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4205.909s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1713.056s">Mr.</a> President, I think part of the concern is naturally the public safety concern, but there are many residents in this community that are not familiar with the parking rules and regulations, and one of them is no parking 20 feet within an intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1726.905s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1728.526s">And</a> many residents think they're far enough back or may not be quite familiar and say, hey, I'm a good distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1736.073s">I'm</a> a car length away from this intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1739.476s">And</a> they're getting tagged, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1741.558s">So</a> we know Park Method is doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1744.3s">But</a> I'd like to at least be able to get notification out to residents that there is no parking at any intersection within 20 feet of that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1754.069s">And</a> that's throughout the entire city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1764.044s">Something.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1764.504s">Signage,</a> yellow paint, just to notify residents, as well as keep the streets safe.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1773.509s">I'd</a> like to make an amendment, but I'd also, I don't know how we do it as a council, but I think it would be great to notify the public on some of these issues that I'm hearing around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1786.633s">And</a> one of them is parking within 20 feet of an intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1791.074s">And</a> again, as we probably all hear, parking too close to the apron of a driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1796.016s">I</a> get a lot of calls regarding cars that are parking right up in thickly settled neighborhoods, right up to a driveway, and it makes it increasingly difficult to get into your own driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1806.505s">And</a> I believe you have to park, I think it's two or three feet, I can't recall, I think it's three feet from the apron of a driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1814.211s">And</a> that's seldom enforced, but it's also an issue too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1818.633s">And</a> I think these reminders to the public to let them know that these are rules and regulations that are out there to benefit everyone are helpful.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1830.297s">So</a> I'm not sure how we get that out other than me just mentioning it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1834.218s">But</a> I'm not sure how we get that out.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1894.718s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1998.91s">The</a> one stipulation with Park Method, they only enforce streets that have resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=2004.712s">So</a> the other several hundred streets in the city that don't have it, don't get that type of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=2010.413s">So</a> I think we have to have a consistent policy, whether you're on a resident permit parking street or not, where these infractions are enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=2018.703s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_qKKOF8-DbmQ/2024-11-19_qKKOF8-DbmQ.html">City Council 02-04-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1076.632s">Okay,</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1078.533s">I</a> think part of the concern that I see is the fact that disseminating information out to the public, and how do we get into the circles where we may have a larger need? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1094.759s">And</a> I'm not sure quite how to do that, to be honest with you, and maybe we can do some brainstorming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1101.422s">In</a> my other life, I work with homeless families. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1105.043s">And</a> I can tell you right now that probably a majority, if not all, of our families that we service through the Department of Housing and Community Development do have food insecurities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1116.771s">And</a> the Greater Boston Food Bank has done tremendous work in assisting 3,600 families currently right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1126.078s">that</a> the state houses to get them off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1129.64s">And</a> in my opinion, when you end food insecurity, you also need to end homelessness. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1138.265s">And</a> they go hand in hand.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1163.451s">You</a> know, I've been on this council, uh, 18 years and I could tell you over the last year or two, I received more phone calls from people that are living out of their car that lived in the city, can no longer afford to live here, but maybe in their car living in the cemetery or behind <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1181.522s">the</a> mall, and it's happening more and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1184.963s">And</a> it's really at a point right now that I think we as a community have to step up and address this issue that for years maybe just went under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1195.225s">But</a> I'm seeing it more and more, I'm fielding the phone calls now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1198.946s">And</a> I think we should work in conjunction with your task force as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1206.728s">any</a> other agency that would like to step up and assist our homeless families that are coming from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1212.831s">These</a> aren't people that are just moving into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1215.352s">These</a> are families that have lived here for many years that all of a sudden, because of the economy, they can't keep up and they become homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1222.936s">And</a> it's at an epidemic proportion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1228.158s">But</a> I appreciate all the work you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1229.839s">I</a> do support this and will support this tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3373.58s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3375.741s">Regarding</a> the vaults, in particular vault 8 and 10.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3380.664s">Any</a> time frame when that work will start?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3400.605s">And</a> roughly, what's the length of those two vaults?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3407.369s">Two</a> weeks?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3424.2s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3425.12s">And</a> isn't there a way of checking for ledge before you start to dig?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3442.257s">And</a> depending on the type of ledge, would that include blasting?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3465.816s">And</a> residents notified when that type of jackhammer was?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3471.505s">So</a> if any of that takes place on vault 8 or 10, there'll be ample notification of area residents?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3478.551s">Do</a> you guys do any video of people's homes and so forth if they're in close proximity?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3494.753s">The</a> other question I had, currently within the MOU, there's some language in there that states if there's any city utilities that are either over or under your transmission wire, if they're cast iron or so forth, that you would replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3512.51s">Is</a> that not correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3528.478s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3529.318s">Has</a> any of that happened to date?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3535.04s">But</a> you are working over and under our utilities, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3538.023s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3538.623s">And</a> you haven't seen anything to date that needs to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3542.287s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3542.667s">Now,</a> replaced meaning you see something actively leaking or you see something actively wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3548.953s">Is</a> that when you see it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3552.937s">Right,</a> but just the mere fact that it may be a cast iron pipe, water cast iron pipe, is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3560.48s">From</a> my reading of the MOU that I have in front of me, signed by the city solicitor, it states that, this is bullet point three. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3574.176s">It</a> says, in addition to surface reconstruction, Eversource should upgrade city-owned underground utilities that are in close proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3582.304s">For</a> example, a minimum, a bucket width of five feet to their new transmission main and or for those utilities that cross over under the transmission main. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3595.982s">So</a> are you saying that only if you see something actively wrong with the pipe that you would bring it to the city's attention? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3602.344s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3603.124s">So</a> you don't think that there's a responsibility to replace anything that you cross over or under?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3610.626s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3612.566s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to get just a response from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3617.247s">Regarding</a> bullet point three in the MOU for March 9, 2017, that was signed by City Solicitor Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3628.152s">Just</a> if we can get clarification on the responsibility of Eversource when they cross over our utilities.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3660.962s">I</a> am good for now, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3662.242s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4185.979s">Paper</a> 20-054 offered by Vice President Caraviello and President Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4192.706s">Be</a> it resolved that the city administration develop a pilot program to resurface a portion of our roads using recycled asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4201.836s">Vice</a> President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4215.527s">What's</a> up with this thing now?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4317.417s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4319.619s">President</a> Falco.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4831.69s">So</a> if I could, from the chair, I agree that funding would be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4836.414s">And</a> the Chapter 90 money is very limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4838.655s">I</a> think it's about $980,000 a year we receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4842.298s">However,</a> there is linkage money that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4845.16s">You</a> would know better than I, Mr. President, how much money is left in that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4848.403s">But</a> I would tend to say, as Councilor Knights mentioned, if we could take that equipment and do it in-house, <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4855.187s">We</a> go from doing one or two streets to many streets, and I realize the upfront cost, but it may be worth looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4862.548s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4864.389s">Councilor</a> Bierce.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=261.629s">Mr.</a> President, after we've done signing, can we take paper 20-048?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2087.223s">Thank</a> you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2088.063s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Morell for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2091.427s">I</a> remember last year's discussions and at the time I believe it was two or three people that took advantage of the tax deferral program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2099.987s">And</a> at the time when we were discussing of raising the income levels and also lowering the interest rate, we thought by taking a step by lowering it from 8% to 5%, we'd see if we attracted more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2115.793s">Was</a> that more attractive to people that possibly wanted to do a deferral? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2121.154s">And</a> I think it's too soon to tell now, but over the next several months, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2125.996s">We</a> should see if that was somewhat successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2129.137s">And</a> I agree the next logical step is increasing the income levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2134.299s">So</a> I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2135.68s">I</a> also want to put out there that this is one of several programs that seniors could take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2143.254s">The</a> other program that we have is the state circuit breaker tax credit program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2148.679s">And</a> that's been around for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2150.921s">It's</a> 100% through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2153.943s">So</a> it's not a city run program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2156.686s">And</a> based on how it works is when your tax bill exceeds 10% of your total income, you qualify. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2166.343s">So</a> it's 10% of your total income, you qualify this for this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2171.887s">And</a> for the tax year 2019, the amount that you would qualify for is $1,130. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2177.051s">So</a> if any senior out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2182.195s">is</a> interested, you have to apply for it when you do your taxes, which are coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2187.317s">This</a> is an ideal time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2190.038s">And</a> that's when you would apply for this through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2192.998s">And</a> you would have to follow their rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2195.219s">But</a> that more or less is, in a nutshell, how do you apply for it and who's eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2203.001s">The</a> other one is the regular statutory exemptions that we have currently in this city right now for, I believe, veterans, disabled, the blind, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2212.071s">and</a> also seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2213.714s">And</a> there may be another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2214.535s">I</a> think there may be five or six exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2217.503s">And</a> the one that I'm speaking about, Mr. President, this council back many years ago, through my resolution, lowered the age from 70 to 65, which actually helped thousands of people take advantage of it, that five-year gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2231.248s">And</a> that's something I'm proud of that we did many, many years ago to help seniors in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2237.031s">But</a> the senior exemption, Mr. President, and this is something we have to look up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2241.192s">It's</a> set up statutorily. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2243.22s">So</a> we can't raise the income levels, but we can ask our state delegation, which we ask a lot of things, if they would look at it on a state level, Mr. President, because depending on where you live, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2257.24s">in</a> Massachusetts, these income levels are way out of whack. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2261.041s">So</a> for instance, your income to be eligible for the senior statutory property tax exemption is not to exceed $24,758 if you're single or $37,137 if you're married. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2281.035s">So</a> those are the two income levels that you can't exceed to be currently eligible for a $1,000 exemption in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2289.244s">The</a> one nice thing about this program is we get paid for a portion of what we give in exemption back by the state through our cherry sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2298.95s">So</a> we actually get something in back. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2300.451s">So</a> actually, we should be promoting this for our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2304.013s">They're</a> getting $1,000, and we're also getting somewhat reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2307.715s">So</a> we're not fully losing out the $1,000 on our tax roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2311.597s">So</a> it's a win-win for the resident and also for the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2316.52s">And</a> also, there's the income level I just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2320.902s">And</a> regarding estates, you cannot exceed, if you're single, $40,000 in estate revenue or worth and $55,000 for married. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2334.449s">And</a> this does not count your domicile. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2336.51s">So</a> it does not count where you live. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2338.211s">So</a> if you have other assets and so forth that are above the $40,000 for single and $55,000, that's also another criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2346.001s">But</a> this program, I believe hundreds of Medford residents, I can't remember the last count, take advantage of this program every year, Mr. President, and count on it because of the way taxes are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2357.666s">But</a> as I mentioned at the beginning, $24,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2359.587s">If</a> someone's making $24,000 and they want to rent in the city of Medford, you wouldn't be renting in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2368.07s">You</a> wouldn't be able to afford anything else but possibly your rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2372.901s">So</a> these numbers are way out of whack. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2375.062s">Maybe</a> if you're living out in Fall River or maybe in Springfield, that may swing it for a single person out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2382.086s">Who</a> knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2382.586s">Maybe</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2383.827s">But</a> around here, it doesn't, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2386.208s">And</a> I would ask that we as a council, because this has been an issue for years, and it does go up incrementally every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2394.753s">So</a> it went up from last year, it was 24,000, it might have been 24,100 rather than 24,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2400.876s">So</a> it does go up a certain percentage every year, but it's not enough to be eligible to the masses, which I think in this day and age we all want to get to because many seniors like my mother and many other mothers in here, they may be property rich, but they're money poor. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2419.529s">They</a> don't have the fluidity of having money. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2422.792s">They</a> have a house that's worth something they bought years and years ago, but they don't have the cash to pay for the taxes and everything else that goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2430.237s">The</a> cable bill and you name it, everything goes up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2433.44s">So</a> these are important things that seniors that are low income, seniors in our community need to take advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2442.187s">And</a> if we can do anything, like Councilor Morell mentioned, about increasing the income and asset levels, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2449.512s">I</a> think we should be promoting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2451.193s">So</a> I want to thank the Council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2616.12s">I</a> can hear what Dr. Streller is mentioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2618.422s">At</a> this point, because there's only two households taking advantage of this, what we're trying to do, doctor, is increase the number of participants by lowering the interest rate from 8% to 5%, making it more attractive, by increasing the income levels to make it more attractive. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2635.913s">And</a> by the way, that dollar a piece that you're talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2641.417s">has</a> to be realized every year, but we're also getting an interest off this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2648.062s">So</a> the people that are doing the deferment, if you have roughly an $8,000 tax rate, you're going to be paying $400 eventually when you settle up on that every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2661.474s">So</a> really, it's going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2665.431s">It's</a> not really paid out by the people that aren't taking the deferment because we're gonna get it back through the deferral. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2673.134s">But</a> what we're trying to do is increase the number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2675.975s">So</a> right now, you're right, it's marginal because there's only two people taking advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2680.476s">But</a> that's not the intent, to keep it marginal.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3693.039s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3695.06s">I</a> hate to say it, but here we go again. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3696.661s">This</a> was a promise that was made back in 2014 when then Mayor McGlynn signed the parking contract enforcement with Republic Parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3718.152s">And</a> at the time when they were rolling out this program, because it was considered to be somewhat detrimental to the business districts because of the new parking regulations and could have possible impact to business and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3739.02s">could</a> possibly deter people from using our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3743.142s">At</a> the time, Mayor McGlynn offered, and I sat on the committee, the parking enforcement committee at the time, offered an olive branch to the Chamber of Commerce saying that $250,000 would be used from the enforcement money received, and that would be $50,000 for each of the five business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3766.315s">That's</a> where it came, all came out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3769.039s">And</a> over the last several years, I've brought this up a half a dozen times. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3773.862s">So</a> if you heard this once, you'll hear it again and again, questioning where is this money? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3779.684s">Where</a> is it sitting? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3780.965s">How</a> come it hasn't been allocated to the different business districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3786.388s">I</a> know many of them, such as Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3788.769s">Salem</a> Street Business Association, West Medford Business Association, have met with their membership, have discussed improvements they'd like to see in the neighborhood, have taken these improvements back to the city administration, and for the last five years, nothing has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3805.32s">So</a> you can feel the sense of frustration, not only with the business owners, but us as a council, because I'm not the only one that has spoken about this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3815.146s">So,</a> you know, and over the last few years I've heard, well, that was a commitment by the former mayor, and it doesn't mean the next mayor would carry it out, or that was just a one-year commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3827.594s">So</a> I've heard a lot of different scuttlebutt. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3829.975s">And</a> if you look at Method Patch, dated October 2014, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3834.898s">The</a> article is New Parking Enforcement in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3838.141s">It</a> states, Mayor Michael J. McGlynn signed the parking enforcement contract with Republic Parking System on Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3844.726s">The</a> city of Medford hopes the new enforcement will benefit the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3850.31s">About</a> $250,000 of revenue collected each year will go to improving the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3858.737s">So</a> that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3859.377s">That's</a> the Medford patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3861.839s">So</a> they must have heard it somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3864.338s">City</a> website, I assume someone from the city typed this in, dated October, again, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3874.421s">And</a> it says Medford signs parking enforcement contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3879.823s">After</a> deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, Mayor McGlynn is recommending the following changes to the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3889.567s">I'm</a> not going to read all the changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3891.647s">But</a> this is one of them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3893.788s">Recommended</a> 250,000 of revenue generated on a yearly basis, yearly basis, to be dedicated to the business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3906.617s">So</a> based on what Mayor McGlynn offered back in 2014, we're looking at, because this was the end of 2014, right now we're looking at five years of backlog. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3918.454s">So</a> that's $1,250,000 that was promised to the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3924.676s">They</a> have yet to receive one red cent. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3928.678s">And</a> they've done a lot of work in their subcommittees putting together plans, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3934.22s">So</a> I bring this up tonight for a number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3936.621s">The</a> fact that we have a new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3940.063s">And</a> I believe Mayor Lungo-Koehn is fully on board with this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3945.884s">But</a> I bring it up to revitalize this and to start the dialogue again with the Chamber of Commerce to get this going, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3956.846s">You</a> can go into any one of our business districts, and they need attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3962.368s">They</a> all need attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3965.356s">And</a> I'm not pointing the finger at anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3967.017s">They</a> need attention, whether it's sidewalks, barrels, you name it, Mr. President, lighting, anything that would increase traffic, increase viability in the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3984.491s">And</a> the money was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3985.312s">So</a> tonight I'm asking, Mr. President, where is the money over the past five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3993.615s">So</a> Mayor McGlynn gave the commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3996.096s">I'm</a> not sure because Mayor Burke never really gave a response when I asked this over the last four years, other than the fact that the business districts were working on a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4008.68s">So</a> at this point, I'd like to know where the money is sitting, Mr. President, and I would respectfully ask, under this new administration, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, that this money, Mr. President, as soon as the plans are presented, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4023.103s">be</a> given out. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4024.064s">And</a> even if we start off with the original commitment of $250,000 and move forward, I think we'd all be fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4031.672s">And</a> I think the chamber, I won't speak for them, I think they would be very happy to start that off, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4038.119s">And</a> like I said, they have plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4040.862s">They</a> did their homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4042.103s">They</a> know what improvements they'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4045.299s">Whether</a> it's benches, there was a lot of things mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4048.22s">Power</a> washing sidewalks, putting new lighting, putting some decorations in certain areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4055.083s">So</a> new sidewalks in areas that could use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4059.084s">So</a> that's my resolution tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4061.505s">I</a> know Mayor Lungo-Koehn's going to follow up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4064.546s">And</a> I feel comfortable moving forward that that commitment that was made in 2014 to the business districts will be kept, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4072.569s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4526.318s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4527.178s">This</a> has been, as Councilor Knight alluded to, a long ongoing issue in the community regulating these drop boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4535.926s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Caraviello for doing the homework and research on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4540.73s">I</a> think it's a magnificent idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4542.251s">I</a> would also recommend, in addition to what Councilor Knight mentioned about those amendments which were a concern, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4549.997s">because</a> we don't want to impact fundraising and so forth of any type of school facility and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4557.519s">But</a> these boxes at the very least, Mr. President, should have some type of ID tag on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4563.021s">Who</a> owns it? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4563.961s">Who</a> operates it? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4565.082s">A</a> contact number? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4566.462s">There's</a> nothing on these boxes at all.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4590.762s">No,</a> I just wanted to make those points that at the very least, Mr. President, like I mentioned last time this was brought up, we regulate dumpsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4600.084s">If</a> you're doing some home improvement and you want to get a dumpster, we not only regulate it, we charge you a fee, but someone could pop up a dumpster in any open lot outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4610.586s">The</a> one on the Fells where I keep referring to because I drive by it all the time, there are five boxes out there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4616.547s">It's</a> not about one medium-sized box, there's a large, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4620.828s">Giant</a> box out there with four small ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4623.631s">Looked</a> like it had babies. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4625.573s">Four</a> smaller boxes now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4627.435s">And</a> there's stuff all over the place out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4630.417s">And</a> people are constantly dropping things off. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4632.64s">You</a> go out there, anytime there's always items out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4635.783s">And</a> it's a safety issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4638.065s">What</a> if a little kid climbs in one of these boxes? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4641.035s">You</a> know, we have no way of getting in these. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4642.575s">We</a> have no way of, no contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4644.756s">We</a> don't know who's operating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4646.576s">It's</a> a real safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4647.797s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4648.677s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4649.857s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4653.678s">I'll</a> offer it at the time of the committee meeting, so no, no.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5240.526s">Actually,</a> Councilor Bears just reiterated what I was going to state. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5245.709s">I</a> was wondering if Councilor Penta was aware of any community that did have a moratorium that a 40B project was not allowed at.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5264.54s">And</a> that stopped a potential 40B project?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5271.183s">But</a> was there a 40B project offered during that period of time?<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_7sfoGg_NhzM/2024-11-19_7sfoGg_NhzM.html">City Council 01-21-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=518.712s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=520.353s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=521.433s">I</a> want to thank you, Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=523.014s">Is</a> it two goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=523.955s">Mm-hmm.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=535.24s">You</a> have to wear that proudly around your neck. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=536.941s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=538.702s">If</a> I had one of those, I would never take it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=540.603s">Believe</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=544.997s">I'd</a> like to thank you personally for representing our city so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=549.959s">And</a> I wish you well in your future endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=553.1s">And</a> I can tell you there's a local sports team, the Boston Bruins, that can use a goal scorer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=558.822s">So</a> don't stop here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=559.902s">Keep</a> moving forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=561.562s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=562.563s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1000.357s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1002.879s">Last</a> week, Mr. President, there was a meeting held here at City Hall regarding the 5G network and potential installation in this community by Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1016.849s">Verizon</a> has petitioned the city for, from my understanding, at least <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1024.039s">three</a> to four dozen locations within the community to add these small cell networks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1032.025s">throughout</a> the community, and we received a letter which I've already read into the record several weeks back from Verizon, dated December 10th, 2019, to then-Mayor Stephanie Burke regarding their applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1049.413s">And</a> I won't read the whole letter, but more or less the letter is stating that method is in current violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1057.257s">of</a> the FCC rules and regulations which requires the city of Medford after 60 days to either approve or deny small cell applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1074.146s">Verizon</a> went on to say that they would be willing to give us an extension until January 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1082.79s">And</a> I am not sure which I will be asking tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1086.88s">where</a> the city stands with these current applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1090.421s">But</a> for tonight's purpose, Mr. President, I received a number of phone calls and emails from area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1097.123s">This</a> has been an issue that I've been on top of for the last several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1102.344s">And</a> many residents who reached out were concerned not only with a number of issues related to 5G, but also the potential health impact it could have on residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1118.43s">So</a> tonight, Mr. President, I will be offering a motion tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1122.951s">But</a> I would like to go through, which was provided to me by a number of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1129.313s">One</a> being Jay Ritchie, who I think is in the audience here, Mr. President, provided this council along with the mayor with an abundance of information regarding health impacts, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1144.378s">ordinances</a> in other cities and towns throughout the United States, and also actions taken by local legislatures throughout the United States as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1158.426s">But,</a> Mr. President, local ordinances note various purposes for ordinances, such as preserving visual character, protecting environmental resources, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1172.099s">and</a> protecting residents against adverse health effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1177.102s">They</a> take a variety of approaches, such as prohibiting small cells in certain areas, creating application and recertification fees, and imposing aesthetic and administrative requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1191.966s">Under</a> location ordinance suggestions, Mr. President, and what I'm hoping to do tonight is just to start the dialogue because the mayor, in her wisdom, Mayor Burke, when we were approached with these requests originally, there was no city ordinance that governed these. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1210.555s">And</a> I think the mayor did a tremendous job at the time for what resources that she had. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1215.939s">She</a> created an administrative policy that would govern the approach to applying for an application and how the city would handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1228.107s">And</a> also the creation of what the city refers to as the method ad hoc small cell committee, which is the granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1238.735s">and</a> they may have put together a several page policy, but in my opinion, it was good for the time that it was presented, but it doesn't go far enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1249.976s">to</a> add the protections that we need as a community and to have a full-fledged ordinance because Verizon is going to be the first of many vendors that will be before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1261.618s">And</a> you can count on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1263.179s">So</a> getting back to the local ordinances, location suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1268.68s">Prohibiting</a> small cell installations in residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1273.341s">Requiring</a> installations to be certain distance away from residences, schools, hospitals, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1280.99s">Specifying</a> that installations must be relocated when they would interfere with public projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1287.832s">Aesthetics</a> and environment ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1290.392s">These</a> are just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1292.773s">Aesthetic</a> design, noise requirements such as co-location, camouflage, height, and light limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1300.855s">The</a> administrative legal suggestions for ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1304.296s">Requiring</a> that residents who will be within a certain distance of an installation be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1310.496s">instating</a> automatic time limits for permits, requiring annual recertification fees, requiring permittees to defend and indemnify the city for many liabilities arising from permits in the installation, operation, and maintenance of small cell installations, reserving the right to hire independent consultants at the applicant's expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1335.674s">What</a> was presented to us, Mr. President, and there were several states, but the state of New Hampshire has proposed a bill which would establish a commission to study the environmental and health effects of 5G technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1351.099s">The</a> state of Montana has proposed a joint resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives urging Congress to amend 1996 Telecommunications Act to account for health effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1366.377s">So</a> those are two proposals, Mr. President, that I will be offering tonight that we ask our state delegation submit on behalf of the city of Medford and on behalf of the Commonwealth, because we're not the only city in the Commonwealth that's struggling with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1384.833s">Mr.</a> President, as we all know, this is an FCC regulation, and in my opinion, they really do tie the hands of local government to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1393.904s">And</a> one thing we can act upon is creating an ordinance that will safeguard our residents and also re-insure that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1404.282s">When</a> these installations if and when they do get approved that all the measures are in place mr. President that safeguards our residents So that will be what I'm offering tonight One resolution, I would like to offer now mr. President is be it resolved that the method City Council approve a resolution asking state lawmakers the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1428.587s">in</a> Congress to limit 5G technology deployment in Massachusetts until the health effects are fully understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1447.577s">I</a> can't speak for my colleagues, but I can say, Mr. President, many residents that I spoke to, no one's against <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1455.495s">new</a> technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1456.836s">No</a> one's against advancements in technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1460.058s">No</a> one's against having our residents not have the technology that would enable them to use their devices and all sorts of angles and aspects and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1470.906s">But</a> what we are against, Mr. President, is moving forward without getting the proper answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1481.307s">I</a> have asked several times, I was here at the meeting that Verizon held, and Verizon will be the first to come out and say there are no health concerns that they are aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1493.896s">And</a> I got that from every representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1496.658s">However,</a> when you go on the internet, you'll see experts saying there are concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1502.418s">So</a> this is no different than a trial when you have two experts, they may be physicians or accountants, say two completely different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1511.724s">And</a> on behalf of our residents, Mr. President, we should proceed with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1516.286s">And</a> if that caution is that we take a while to explore this issue and make sure that it's safe, these devices are going to be within 200, 300 feet of residents' homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1528.268s">They're</a> going to be in backyards where kids are playing, close to parks, close to schoolyards, close to churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1535.213s">So</a> we have to make sure that we do our due diligence, Mr. President, when it comes to creating the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1542.657s">The</a> second thing, Mr. President, I'd like to bring up is I happen to have bumped into recently a former member of the Burlington Selectmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1551.992s">And</a> the town of Burlington, I would tell anyone interested in this subject, they should really go on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1559.054s">They</a> have an application process, Mr. President, that is literally probably 10 pages long. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1568.296s">And</a> it's a very in-depth process that makes these particular vendors jump through many hurdles in order to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1579.474s">And</a> from what I've been told by the town of Burlington is there was enough hurdles that they got tired jumping over hurdles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1590.14s">And</a> the application process is equally, Mr. President, which I have equally as Cumminson, these design rules and regulations, which is about a 20-page report that was issued by the town of Burlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1606.943s">Very</a> in depth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1608.903s">And</a> then there was a number of correspondence back and forth from attorneys that were hired to discuss the issue on behalf of the town in Verizon, which I won't get into tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1623.387s">I</a> would like to just briefly mention that some of the things that we should be looking at as a community, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1632.217s">And</a> this is not unique to Method, but prior to any installation, a structural analysis should be completed to ensure the pole can handle the additional equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1644.069s">That</a> should be the very first thing either in our policy, which is not there currently, or in our city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1652.177s">The</a> city should ask about a host agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1656.314s">When</a> we sign on, Mr. President, to anything happen in this community, the first thing that we usually do is sign a host agreement to make sure that if there are any issues that arise from this, that the city of Medford will be covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1673.283s">There</a> should be an agreement in place that requires the removal of these systems when obsolete. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1679.346s">Right</a> now, you can go down any street in our community, Mr. President, and you see dishes <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1686.052s">They're</a> on the side of homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1687.933s">I</a> have one across the street from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1690.133s">It's</a> a two-family, but they have three dishes that have been disconnected for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1696.235s">It's</a> just a blight, an eyesore, and there should be a provision in there when they become obsolete, no longer useful, that they be removed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1706.098s">I</a> realize they're on private property, but I feel strongly about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1710.159s">And</a> this is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1711.359s">These</a> will be located on public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1714.827s">and</a> public right-of-ways, but when they're no longer useful, they should have a plan to remove them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1722.352s">The</a> city should establish design rules and regulations that I won't get into, similar to what the town of Burlington did, as well as the application to ensure compliance with city policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1735.08s">Verizon</a> should also provide the city with a long-range plan, including future expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1743.308s">We</a> should not be subjected to the one and twosies of these, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1748.315s">Last</a> I spoke to the city engineer, I believe he said there were three or four dozen applications, and there possibly could be upwards to 100 from what he's being told. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1761.368s">And</a> I believe at the very least, as a community, we should know what their intent is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1767.631s">Is</a> the intent to put 100? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1769.372s">We</a> should know the locations offhand, Mr. President, and we should know if they are the only ones that are gonna be doing this in the community, because in my opinion, they're not gonna be the only ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1780.197s">Verizon</a> should also provide a public health, I'm sorry, public health concerns be addressed by an independent study. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1792.469s">So</a> that would be, Mr. President, the city requesting, I know Verizon has done their studies on health and the impact and effects of 5G on residents and so forth, but the city should have its own independent study so therefore we can rely on valid information from a neutral party and not someone that's trying to make a dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1818.743s">And</a> I wish them no <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1825.495s">I</a> wish them no animosity, Mr. President, but our job as residents of city council is to ensure the public safety of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1836.209s">And</a> this truly is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1839.733s">The</a> second point, maybe the third point by now, Mr. President, is that several weeks back, the city, actually probably more than several weeks now, the city had its own public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1853.708s">And</a> that was conducted by the ad hoc small cell committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1858.329s">And</a> the correspondence that went out to residents at the time, and I know this has been expanded since, Ashcroft Road, Dutton Circle, Cedar, Lawrence Road, they received a letter from the city that did not really specify the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1877.735s">They</a> received a letter, Mr. President, that wasn't signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1882.676s">They</a> received a letter that called for a public hearing at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1888.945s">making</a> no consideration for people working, people with kids, people that need childcare, people that may not be able to get there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1901.069s">There</a> was no copy or scope of the project within this letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1907.371s">And</a> they did adhere to the mayor's policy about notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1914.013s">And</a> that was to notify residents within 300 feet of the installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1919.986s">As</a> we both know, 300 feet would be here to probably the far back of the chamber and maybe a little further outside, Mr. President, in the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1930.512s">It's</a> not much notification to a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1933.874s">I</a> requested, along with this council, it was unanimous, that we increase the notification to at least 500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1941.058s">That</a> was passed unanimously by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1944.481s">That</a> any other future mailings that go out <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1947.219s">that</a> the specific location be mailed along with a copy of the site plan by Verizon, and that all public hearings take place after 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1963.325s">so</a> that we can have more resident involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1966.206s">That</a> was sent to the city administration back, I think it was a month and a half, two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1971.848s">And,</a> uh, I am not sure if the mayor, mayor Burke at the time, uh, updated the policy that was under her prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1980.291s">And</a> that's why I think we need a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1982.932s">So,</a> uh, I look forward, Mr. President, uh, to sending word out to our state delegation in the form of, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1993.046s">If</a> we want to do council resolution, asking that state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2004.172s">Bear</a> with me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2006.813s">The</a> state delegation, our state delegation establish a commission to study the environmental and health effects of 5G technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2022.622s">So</a> that's the second resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2024.383s">And</a> the third resolution is that our state delegation offer before the House of Representatives and also the State Senate, which would include Senator Jalen, urging Congress to amend the Telecommunication Act 1996, of 1996. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2037.206s">To</a> account for health effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2046.397s">So</a> those would be the three resolutions I'd like to offer tonight, Mr. President, as well as you reconvening a meeting so we can start diligently working on our own ordinance to safeguard residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2059.085s">And</a> I look forward to hearing what my colleagues have to say and also residents in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2065.289s">Last</a> week's meeting, I also thought was going to be a question answer type meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2070.393s">I</a> know there were a lot of residents that were upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2073.054s">It</a> was more of a <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2074.42s">just</a> an informational meeting where you can walk around and talk to representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2079.226s">And</a> I'm not sure you're quite going to get that out of tonight's meeting, but I'm hoping after tonight's meeting we will invite Verizon down, we will invite <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2089.537s">the</a> Method Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee, who is the granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2093.999s">We</a> will invite the mayor down, Mr. President, and have our own public hearing here so residents can ask Verizon the tough questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2102.422s">And</a> this council, as well as the mayor, as well as this Ad Hoc Committee, can be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2107.824s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3680.575s">Every</a> petition comes with a start date. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3683.896s">So</a> the date commences when the 60 day period starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3688.637s">So</a> the first batch, and I'm not sure how many were in the first batch, the date that we had as a city was December 20th to act upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3698.038s">Verizon</a> came back because the city did not act and said, okay, we'll give you another 30 days, which brought it to January 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3707.051s">Now,</a> I'm under the impression they still need approval from the city of town, from this ad hoc committee that was created by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3717.136s">And</a> when that's gonna happen, we can ask the city engineer who happens to chair that committee what his thoughts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3725.181s">But</a> as far as I know, it doesn't just automatically get approved.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5328.766s">Do</a> you prefer separate votes on these? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5330.227s">I</a> prefer separate just in case they all get sent, and then they all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5334.85s">Different</a> directions.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5341.854s">Mr.</a> President, I'm not sure if I've asked already, but I would request that this council have a public hearing, and invite a state delegation, the mayor of the city of Medford, the Medford Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5359.249s">Verizon,</a> our city solicitor, and Congresswoman Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5367.872s">At</a> a public hearing here, Mr. President, at the earliest that you can call for that and get all the parties together to discuss 5G.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5398.624s">The</a> last one? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5399.585s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5400.045s">So</a> the last one was that the state delegation proposed a joint resolution of the Senate and the House urging Congress to amend <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5413.925s">the</a> Telecommunication Act of 1996 to account for health effects.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5455.172s">C</a> paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5456.552s">So</a> it would be that a state delegation proposed a bill which would establish a commission to study the environmental and health effects of 5G technology.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5501.93s">And</a> the B paper is a resolution from this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5506.692s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford City Council approve a resolution asking our state delegation, the Federal Communications Commission, and Congress to limit 5G technology deployment in Massachusetts until the health effects are fully understood.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5573.922s">And</a> that's the creation of a public hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5576.123s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5637.916s">That</a> is correct, and I appreciate that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5640.457s">It's</a> a public meeting, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6057.708s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6058.849s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues, Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Knight for signing on to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6065.212s">All</a> of us that behind this reel, Mr. President, can appreciate the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6070.353s">that</a> Carol has done over four decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6072.935s">And</a> you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler person. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6076.138s">Always</a> has a smile on her face and willing to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6079.781s">And</a> anyone that could stay in this city service for 40 years deserves a recommendation, Mr. President, of great service, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6090.629s">So</a> I want to commend her and thank her personally for her many years of city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6095.813s">And</a> I think we should dedicate this meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6098.251s">after</a> Carol for all the years of service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6101.633s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6102.414s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6797.344s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6799.164s">Gerard</a> was a true family man that lived in this community for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6805.346s">Again,</a> someone that always had a smile on his face and was willing to lend a hand if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6812.088s">He</a> is also the father of our superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edouard Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6820.091s">And</a> he will surely be missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7117.267s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7118.708s">I</a> agree with the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7120.629s">I'm</a> not quite sure an executive order, uh, would be the Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7125.051s">Um,</a> and the reason why I say that is traffic commission is set up by state statute and they're an autonomous, as the councilor mentioned, an autonomous body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7135.057s">And</a> I'm not sure enough executive directive can change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7140.32s">Um,</a> but I think it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7142.779s">worthy</a> to ask, or maybe you can ask more of a general question, if the mayor would be willing to reach out to the different boards and commissions to see if she can get a buy-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7153.061s">But</a> either way, I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7155.922s">I</a> believe strongly that, as my council colleagues mentioned, that these meetings should be open to everyone to attend, and during the day is just not adequate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7165.404s">So</a> I support it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7352.046s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7353.066s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7353.886s">There</a> were a lot of great ideas and priorities brought up during this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7360.029s">The</a> one thing that I am grateful, and I believe you were the first to bring it up, were the pre-budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7366.452s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7367.212s">Because</a> for many years, we were, as a council, I believe, and I won't speak for everyone, but I think there was a sense of frustration once we got the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7377.557s">It</a> was already in ink. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7380.459s">And</a> our only authority was really to cut from the bottom line and not to offer suggestions, like I think many of us have, on ways of improving how government operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7392.838s">And</a> I think it's very helpful that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7395.2s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn now is talking about us looking at the budget and potentially April, which has never happened in my 18 years on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7405.929s">And</a> I look forward to actually a preview of the budget where we can have some input before it goes into final status on obtaining some of the priorities and important measures that we see as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7419.361s">There's</a> seven of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7420.822s">You</a> know, we're out in the streets, we're listening to constituents, we receive the same emails and phone calls, and what better advice or counsel to have than members of this council when you are putting together the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7434.006s">And</a> that has never happened since I've been on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7437.386s">And</a> I look forward under your leadership, along with this new mayor, to actually sit down around the table and discuss not only the mayor's priorities, but our priorities and how do we incorporate that in a budget process.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_eQfu2R5n4yE/2024-11-19_eQfu2R5n4yE.html">City Council 01-14-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=391.505s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=393.727s">The</a> pilot, in lieu of taxes, has been an issue on my plate since I got on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=400.213s">And</a> actually, when I first got on the council, the city of Medford didn't have a program at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=405.618s">And</a> it was at my urging that the mayor back then, Mayor McGlynn, signed the first pilot program, and it was a 10-year program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=413.883s">And</a> you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=414.924s">There</a> was actually no input from the public at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=418.886s">It</a> was an agreement between the president of Tufts and the mayor of Medford and nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=424.77s">So</a> I look forward to the establishment, to be quite honest, of a commission that would be involved, would get public input, and not only in the payment end of it, but also as the city of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=437.479s">The</a> city of Boston has, as you may know, has a full-fledged pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=442.782s">And</a> they actively go out and solicit, because you can't make it mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=447.364s">Pilot</a> payment is voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=449.725s">And</a> they go out and they actively solicit non-profits. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=454.248s">And</a> depending on the size of the non-profit, they have all different criteria on what they seek out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=463.232s">And</a> we really don't have any of that in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=465.756s">We</a> have a number of small ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=467.759s">I</a> believe Harvard Vanguard pays a pilot in the community, as well as Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=472.125s">But</a> there are other organizations, Mr. President, that may be able to assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=479.716s">the</a> community when asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=481.397s">And</a> you don't know unless you have a program set up and you don't know unless you ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=485.518s">So</a> I agree with this endeavor and I hope that we can establish, I'm not sure, I think we as a council could meet and committee the whole subcommittee and try to put something together as well as having the city solicitor draft an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=503.883s">But</a> I think it could be under our purview, Mr. President, to create something that works for not only the nonprofits in the city and the residents, but also the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=517.529s">So</a> I support this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1023.542s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1024.503s">I</a> appreciate Councilor Scarpelli offering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1027.125s">It</a> was Councilor Knight, I think you mentioned two or three months ago, that brought up this similar resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1032.749s">And</a> prior to that, I happened to live just right across the street and received a number of complaints over the last several years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1040.715s">I</a> tried to reach out to the owner of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1042.536s">I</a> had little success. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1044.778s">I</a> don't remember receiving, three months ago we asked for an update from <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1050.702s">code</a> enforcement, as well as the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1052.963s">Mr.</a> Clerk, if I am mistaken, I haven't seen any response regarding the bin on the Fellsway, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1061.784s">Many</a> cities and towns that regulate them, which we do not, will require on the side of the bin that the owner operator's name be listed, a contact number, the size of the bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1074.966s">These</a> could be very dangerous in nature, these bins, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1078.227s">It</a> sounds harmless, but that Fells Plaza has seen a number of bins that have just been dropped off. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1086.169s">So</a> you'll have an entity that just drops off a bin, they don't ask for approval, and all of a sudden they're in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1092.73s">The</a> one in the Fellsway is manned at least six days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1097.231s">They</a> have staffing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1099.212s">It's</a> a full-fledged business that they're running out of the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1106.399s">So</a> we really have to regulate this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1108.863s">I</a> think that's where it starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1110.606s">We</a> have to regulate these particular bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1112.889s">We</a> have to know who the contact is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1114.953s">If</a> it's not the owner of the property, Mr. President, as far as I'm concerned, that bin shouldn't be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1122.88s">So</a> these are the things I think we have to have discussions regarding, and you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1126.801s">It's</a> not just clothing, it's old computers, it's furniture. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1130.943s">You</a> have to see what's left out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1132.684s">It's</a> a disgrace, and no one should have to live across the street from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1136.405s">It</a> attracts rodents and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1139.963s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that if we don't receive a response from our administration, that we as a council put a cease and desist, even though it's not a legitimate business, because I don't think it's registered in this community, but we put a cease and desist on that particular bin, Mr. President, at that plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1161.157s">And</a> then maybe we'll get some answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1163.768s">So</a> that would be my motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1165.75s">If</a> we haven't received any correspondence from the Board of Health or the Building Commissioner, their office, that we send a message to the building department today, tonight, that a cease and desist order be put on that particular bin that's out in the Fells Park parking lot.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1188.047s">If</a> he doesn't mind amending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1189.168s">If</a> not, we'll... Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1190.229s">So</a> if we don't...
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1234.351s">Counsel</a> marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1235.252s">I</a> don't recall seeing, I believe you offered that what, two months, three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1238.535s">Oh,</a> was it two months ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1241.517s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1286.081s">Right,</a> but just recently you also offered that it was your resolution that those bins be reviewed by billing department and also the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1295.245s">And</a> I don't recall seeing a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1296.786s">Do</a> we get a response?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1302.588s">Right,</a> but we never got a formal communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1305.45s">Mr.</a> President, and this has been an item for I can't tell you how long, so I would say that we as a council should send a message that we'd like to see a cease and desist until we can find out, Mr. President, what's happening down at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1319.799s">Why</a> are things being left and strewn all over the place down there? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1323.881s">Why</a> is there a full-time staff six days a week? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1328.097s">I</a> mean, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1329.957s">Is</a> it a regulated business that has staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1332.918s">I</a> mean, go down there any time, you'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1334.619s">They</a> man it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1335.259s">They</a> have someone that sits inside the bin itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1338.34s">It's</a> open for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1340.26s">It's</a> a legit business.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1344.141s">It</a> may have been on fire.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1357.158s">Thank</a> you, Council Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1359.479s">And</a> is the owner of the property going to take responsibility if something happens there, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1364.56s">These</a> are all questions that need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1367.662s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1387.248s">Regular,</a> I'm not I'm not asking to ban. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1388.668s">I'm</a> asking to regulate absolutely So so they're above board if you as a homeowner doing home improvement And you want to get a bin to empty your waste in that's heavily regulated in this community Heavily regulated and you charge for it as a homeowner But if you all of a sudden want to throw a bin in a parking lot and have it manned six days a week There's no regulations at all Doesn't make sense Thank You console marks
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3914.122s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3916.09s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3917.872s">You</a> know, it was several months back when we had 200 residents from that area, the South Street area, come up when the may was looking to change the direction of South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3928.625s">And</a> this is a two-part issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3930.846s">The</a> corner of Main and South is state property, and we understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3935.829s">And</a> we've been going back and forth with the state regarding signalization and signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3941.132s">But</a> what Mr. Lamb is talking about is South Street, which is under the purview of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3951.161s">And</a> that night, this council voted unanimously on several, like Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, several traffic calming initiatives, some being additional striping, some being signage, raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3966.47s">There</a> were a number of things that were offered that night with the chief, Chief Buckley, that was in the room, Mr. President, and heard the discussion, heard the residents, heard this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3976.956s">I</a> can't say how disappointed I am, many months later, <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3981.528s">Not</a> that the state didn't act, but that the city has not acted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3988.653s">And</a> it's even more troubling when I drive around the city and see signs popping up everywhere, Mr. President, stop signs, pedestrian crossing signs, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4000.161s">But</a> this area we've been talking about for years, Mr. President, for years, and we still couldn't get a sign erected after having 200 people come up here discussing the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4011.559s">What</a> is it going to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4013.24s">I</a> don't understand what it takes to get something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4018.063s">And</a> we received no correspondence back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4021.685s">That's</a> even more troubling, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4024.506s">We</a> can put out resolution after resolution after resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4029.669s">And</a> if there's no follow through with this council, then what good is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4036.048s">Really,</a> we're spinning our wheels. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4038.529s">We're</a> going to be in here a year from now talking about the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4046.492s">Mr.</a> President, someone needs to dig up that vote that the council took and resend it to the Chief of Police and the Traffic Commission immediately, asking why hasn't this been done? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4058.637s">Why</a> hasn't it been done? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4061.843s">The</a> traffic commission has met several times since the residents came down. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4067.969s">Is</a> there an issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4068.87s">Is</a> there a problem that we should be concerned about? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4071.112s">If</a> not, these signs should have gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4073.394s">The</a> weather has been permitting for the last couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4077.958s">There's</a> no excuses, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4080.741s">Really,</a> enough's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4083.025s">And</a> this, you know, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I'm tired of talking about the same problems over and over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4089.791s">We're</a> wasting our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4091.532s">We</a> really are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4093.294s">And</a> regarding the trucking route, really, it's the traffic commission that can do something about the trucking route. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4100.063s">And</a> it's an act of Congress to get it changed, just so you know, because you've got to go to the state and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4106.866s">And</a> they did it on Harvard and Salt Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4109.107s">They</a> changed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4110.148s">It's</a> no longer a trucking route. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4111.588s">But</a> that took, I think, about three and a half to four years of actively pursuing it and so forth and coming out with alternatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4118.471s">And</a> that was a real act. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4120.812s">But</a> that's really who would be responsible, the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4124.887s">and</a> you can get put on their agenda and so forth and speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4128.677s">But</a> I would just hate to see, Mr. President, when people come up here, <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4133.194s">They</a> expect to get results and answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4136.197s">That's</a> why they come to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4138.32s">And</a> if we're just going to rubber stamp something and send it off to a department and no follow through to make sure things are actually getting done, then what good are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4147.71s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4148.871s">I'm</a> part of it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4150.073s">I'm</a> not pointing the finger at anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4151.935s">What</a> good are we if we can't get these basic things done? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4156.431s">It</a> makes no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4158.232s">So</a> that should be sent out immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4160.153s">I</a> don't know if it should come from you as the president of the council to reach out to the chief, or if the city clerk should send a correspondence first thing tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4167.477s">But</a> I want to know what happened to all those votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4169.658s">We</a> spent three hours here, Mr. President, talking to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4173.06s">We</a> heard 100 people testify, and then nothing got done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4176.622s">And</a> we can't turn the finger at the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4179.524s">This</a> is a city problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4180.704s">It's</a> a city street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4182.345s">It's</a> our traffic commission.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4464.52s">Thank</a> you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4466.004s">Bob</a> was a tremendous firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4469.665s">I</a> was just getting on the council when he was actually retiring, but he served with distinction this community and its residents for over 29 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4480.288s">He</a> served in engine two and engine six. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4483.369s">And</a> from what I hear from some of the firefighters that served with him, he was always there for an encouraging word. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4489.791s">He</a> was like the gatekeeper of every engine he was part of and was really the glue that held it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4499.014s">And</a> he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_SkrUmad63nQ/2024-11-19_SkrUmad63nQ.html">City Council 01-07-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1101.822s">I</a> want to thank my council colleague for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1104.605s">In</a> addition, as he just alluded to, South and Main Street, that intersection has been in discussion with this council for as long as I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1113.614s">And</a> I believe we're at a bypass at this particular point because the state is saying that in order to do the signalization, you'll need to start from South Street and work your way all the way back. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1124.304s">And</a> it's going to cost them millions of dollars to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1127.627s">Just,</a> I believe it was three or four days ago, there was a major, major accident at that very intersection in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1136.214s">And</a> that happens almost daily from what I hear from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1139.557s">And</a> I would ask again, as you know, we asked our state delegation <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1143.04s">to</a> meet with DOT and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1144.701s">I</a> know Councilor Scott Pell has been very active in this issue, but to be quite frank, there's been very little movement, and even some of the issues that we spoke about, about adding possibly a raised crosswalk, adding some additional signage, things that don't really take into consideration the signalization that they're talking about, and would provide some increased safety in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1171.01s">We're</a> looking at putting <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1172.35s">a</a> brand new police station across the street, and it's one of the most dangerous areas in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1179.177s">I</a> mean, and there's nothing being done to the surrounding infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1182.82s">We're</a> spending millions of dollars on a new building, a new facility, but I wouldn't tell any residents to walk there because I don't trust crossing either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1193.891s">And</a> this is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1196.313s">So</a> I would ask that as part of this recommendation that we also get an update from our state delegation and the Department of Transportation where we stand with the signalization on south of Maine, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1210.382s">Thank</a> you, Councilman Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1382.738s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1383.999s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1384.759s">Just</a> to follow up, Mr. President, and I've been saying this for years, and I know some people don't like when I say it, but I'm going to continue to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1392.924s">We</a> have a number of state roads in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1395.806s">And</a> when we reach out as a council or the mayor reaches out, we expect to at least get a response in a timely manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1403.83s">And</a> that's not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1405.451s">South</a> Street's a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1407.653s">We've</a> been waiting 10 years <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1410.074s">probably</a> even over 10 years, to get some type of relief there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1414.918s">And</a> it's yet to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1416.54s">In</a> my opinion, if we as a community deem this as a public safety hazard, which we know we've received reports from the chief of the hundreds of accidents at that particular intersection, we should be able to intervene as a city and say, enough's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1431.493s">I</a> don't care if it's a state road, a federal road, or a road from whoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1436.477s">We're</a> going to take care of it on behalf of our residents and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1440.08s">And</a> it's not just that area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1442.442s">It's</a> Elm Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1443.563s">It's</a> Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1445.024s">It's</a> sidewalks that the state refuses to come in and fix that's a trip and fall hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1450.389s">It's</a> trees that they refuse to trim on their property that happen to be in front of people's homes that pay taxes in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1458.255s">So</a> if I live in one of these streets that are a state road, I'm paying taxes to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1463.778s">It's</a> very difficult to tell a resident, well, sorry, we as a city can't do anything, even though you're paying taxes to us, we have to wait for the state to step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1474.182s">I</a> think it's about time that we step in, Mr. President, and start making some of these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1480.125s">And</a> let the cods fall where they may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1482.526s">Let</a> the state get upset about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1485.105s">Maybe</a> that'll create a new story, Mr. President, like you see happening now in the news, where some cities and towns are unable to fix these giant potholes and so forth, and some of these state roads, and the inaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1498.414s">And</a> that's a major concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1500.475s">I'm</a> tired of wasting time, to be quite frank, talking about the same issue year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1507.099s">And</a> salt in Maine is a major, major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1511.122s">And</a> this will be the year that we act, one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1514.869s">We</a> have to do something, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1516.531s">We</a> just can't keep on talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1518.133s">Like</a> I said, it was a major accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1519.955s">And</a> I believe there has been a fatality over there in the last several years as well, a pedestrian fatality. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1526.342s">So</a> this is well documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1529.297s">So</a> I just wanna put that in again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1531.439s">These</a> are our roads and streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1533.02s">They</a> may be state under state jurisdiction, but they're our roads and our streets, our residents are crossing them, our residents are driving on them, and we have to maintain safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1542.427s">And</a> if the state's not willing to do anything, then we have to step up as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1547.591s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1548.031s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2093.037s">So,</a> Mr. President, when this agreement was signed in 2014, it's my understanding that money was earmarked by the mayor at the time for different needs in the community, one being public safety, one being road improvements, and I believe there was something in there for arts and so forth, but it spelled out the particular needs in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2118.365s">and</a> what this money would go towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2120.386s">And</a> I'm not sure if every member of the council is aware of this particular document, but I think it would be helpful to provide the council with the document itself and to make sure that the money, when it's being appropriated, especially if it's not gonna require a council approval, that we know what it's being earmarked to. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2141.152s">I</a> can tell you firsthand that road improvements and public safety should be a top priority <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2147.654s">regarding</a> this particular money. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2150.876s">And</a> I would just ask, is that still the case that the money was earmarked to particular needs in the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2159.319s">Do</a> you have that in front of you?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2165.221s">And</a> I agree, but it may be easier just maybe if we can.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2175.252s">Do</a> you have another copy to read off? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2176.672s">Yeah,</a> if you could just read off the needs, because there's some new members of the council, and I've been receiving a number of questions from different organizations in the community that said, geez, we thought that some of that money is supposed to be earmarked to arts or other needs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2192.438s">And</a> I want to be able to get back to these groups.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2218.131s">And</a> we haven't received any of this money as of yet, because it was based on the opening, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2226.28s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2226.7s">And</a> have we expended any money?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2238.877s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2241.538s">How</a> will we know about a complete accounting for this every fiscal year?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2263.536s">Revenue</a> fund, but will that also be part of the budgeting process? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2267.377s">Not</a> a part of the budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2268.897s">Can</a> we make it part of the budgeting process? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2270.738s">So</a> at least every year we're <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2272.819s">Looking</a> at it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2279.441s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2279.981s">I</a> just want to make sure that that's being followed, especially where this is new.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2286.082s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2286.902s">I</a> put on the agenda, it has to be over a year ago, money that was earmarked to the city that was supposed to go to the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2294.537s">from</a> Tufts University, they bought some air rights over the train tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2300.318s">And</a> at the time, the state didn't want to negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2303.639s">They</a> said, you can negotiate on our behalf regarding what you'd like to do with the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2308.981s">And</a> I've yet to get an accounting regarding, I think it was $425,000 or $500,000 on where that money has been spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2318.563s">And</a> I know you provided something, but it didn't say what it was spent on, where it was spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2324.468s">It</a> didn't say if it was spent in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2326.99s">It</a> didn't answer any of the questions.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2355.108s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2355.528s">But</a> what I'm saying as a council, if we wanted to look back and say the 500,000 that was earmarked to the city of method for these purposes, did they go to these purposes and what was actually done? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2367.332s">You</a> can't find that out.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2381.463s">Just</a> so you know, I'm not pointing this at you, but I'm just pointing for the future that it's helpful that we have the ability to go back and say we received X number of dollars, it was earmarked for this, and we'd like to make sure it was spent on this and what was actually done. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2395.952s">And</a> I think moving forward, it's helpful to have those documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2399.534s">And</a> we, because we're not going to be responsible for the allocation anymore, I think at some process, and maybe even though it's not part of the budget process, that may be an ideal time to talk about these other accounts at that time to at least bring them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2413.782s">Because</a> if we don't bring them up, no one's going to be the wiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2417.304s">And</a> it's important that at least there's a second set of eyes taking a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2421.066s">That's</a> all I want to bring up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2430.287s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2766.519s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2770.361s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2794.327s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2799.97s">And</a> that committee was established by the administration, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2803.592s">The</a> previous administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2804.312s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2804.633s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2805.253s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2823.423s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2824.698s">So</a> maybe similar to what's being done with that, we can maybe take a look and look at some of these other, like public safety and so forth, and do something similar, where it's not just a unilateral decision made by the administration, but comprised of a committee made up of maybe someone from the council and members of the community and department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2843.506s">And</a> maybe that may be a similar approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2846.367s">Because</a> I agree, I'm always one for checking balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2850.329s">I</a> agree that anything that would tie the hands of future Councilors, I would not support either. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2857.633s">But</a> I think that may be a good option to have this money, maybe the new administration <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2864.46s">set</a> up additional committees for each of the different topics that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2872.091s">And</a> don't forget the original agreement that was signed, I believe it was signed by Mayor McGlynn back in 2014, that was <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2879.922s">As</a> far as I was on the council, I don't remember any giant community outreach saying, hey community, how would you like to spend this million dollars a year for the next 50 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2890.089s">That</a> was done by the mayor when he negotiated this surrounding community agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2895.55s">And</a> it was done in a vacuum, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2898.431s">And</a> so there wasn't a lot of outreach then. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2900.611s">And</a> maybe now the time is to bring in the community and say, what would we like to see this spent on, spent, how we'd like to see it spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2909.674s">And</a> maybe our needs have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2911.775s">And</a> over time, they may change. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2913.755s">And</a> are we subject to this particular framework? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2920.132s">for</a> the next 50 years or are we able, do we have flexibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2924.354s">Maybe</a> it's not a question for you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2931.158s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2932.079s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2932.339s">So,</a> so maybe, uh, those discussions can be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2935.26s">So</a> I'm in favor of doing whatever the council would like to do if, if they want to maybe include, uh, maybe just a two year span in the home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2945.286s">Uh,</a> they're easy enough to file. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2946.446s">Uh,</a> and so that would only cover our term and, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2949.808s">if</a> we're agreeable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2952.969s">So</a> I'm open.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3065.732s">So</a> this is a request for a home rule petition by the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3071.718s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3071.898s">So</a> this is their home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3073.64s">We</a> can't naturally just amend their petition, but what we can do is request that this amendment take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3082.006s">And</a> if the mayor decides to make this change, then submit it back to us for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3087.01s">So</a> I think we just have to make sure that what we're asking is that the administration changed the whole moon petition because it was initiated by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3096.339s">So</a> we just want to make sure it's a request to, to, to request to amend these, this current document. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3102.864s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3104.166s">And</a> with the language, I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3106.367s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3392.643s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3394.183s">At</a> many of the meetings that we had regarding the brewery ordinance, Allie Fisk from the city administration was one of the leads from the city side, and I believe she also served as the Liquor Commission's secretary of that commission, and she was very instrumental in getting some information for us and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3416.567s">I</a> would ask, Mr. President, whatever meeting that we do have, that we invite members of the Liquor Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3422.088s">And</a> they may be able to also shed some light with Councilor Caraviello just alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3428.151s">And</a> I believe we can move forward with all this information if we get it all around the table at the same time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4380.801s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I'm pleased to see that my colleague, Councilor Knight, is thinking outside the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4387.685s">I</a> think this is healthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4389.867s">The</a> thing I would say, and I think Councilor Bears hit along many of the points that I was going to bring up, but, you know, the allowing for suspension to bring an item up is a council rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4403.605s">So</a> if the concern of this council is that council members are using the council rule to bring up something under suspension, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4413.086s">then</a> moving the night is secondary. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4416.607s">If</a> the issue is bringing stuff under suspension, let's get rid of the rule that allows us to bring stuff up under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4424.149s">And</a> let's discuss that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4425.85s">Because</a> I agree with Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4428.27s">I</a> would say out of the 22% that is part of this resolution, I'd say that 70% are condolences, potholes, and to fix a sidewalk that come up in our interaction <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4441.954s">between</a> weekends and the next council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4444.977s">And</a> so I agree, I don't think there's any pressing issues that I've seen over the years that have come up under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4452.544s">I</a> find it helpful to have that ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4455.947s">I've</a> always been transparent in government and I'm not concerned about where I stand with transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4462.672s">I</a> think we have to remember too that when people get an agenda, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4467.016s">We</a> may know what's on the agenda, we may have quick access as a council to documents, but the general public doesn't have that quick access. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4476.981s">And</a> we're limiting the amount of time that someone from the public can get access to documents and do their research. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4483.865s">It's</a> not just the council that research, it's members of the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4488.587s">And</a> we're cutting in half the amount of time that we're giving people in the public to look at the agenda and research it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4496.09s">And</a> also to get, which we may not consider, child care. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4500.531s">So</a> if the agenda comes out on a Monday and you say, jeez, I'd like to get up there on Wednesday, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4505.593s">It</a> doesn't give you a lot of time to put your ducks in line to be able to get the ability to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4512.522s">And</a> I think having the extra few days gives you the ability to look at the agenda, gives you the ability to do the research, gives you the ability to get the childcare that you may need, and to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4524.117s">It's</a> been working that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4525.377s">I</a> don't see a real issue with the transparency issue regarding what's offered under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4532.539s">I</a> would be very mindful that if we want to keep part of the people in this process, remember, there's a lot of people that watch this meeting to get their news on what's happening in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4545.701s">There's</a> a lot of people that count on the Tuesday night meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4549.824s">This</a> meeting, from what I've been told by historians in this city, has been run on a Tuesday night since 1948. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4556.671s">Now</a> that's not a reason to keep it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4560.715s">Because</a> we've always done it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4562.557s">But</a> I think it's important that Tuesday nights have always been known, that's when the council meets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4567.923s">Monday</a> night, the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4570.165s">And</a> the fact that City Hall changed their hours of operation some eight to 10 years ago, and now have extended hours on a Wednesday night, I don't think should have any bearing on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4581.45s">I've</a> never asked or requested, myself or any member of this council, a department head to come up to this meeting, and we've never got a response saying, oh, you guys meet on a Tuesday, we get out at 4.30 on Tuesday, sorry, can't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4596.076s">Never</a> heard that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4597.677s">So</a> I don't think that's another reason to say, well, we'll have more access to department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4603.302s">I</a> like the idea, and if the idea is transparency, maybe we have to look at suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4608.246s">If</a> that's the big issue, suspension of the rules, then maybe that's eliminate offering things under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4616.45s">You</a> know, I offer things on behalf of people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4619.134s">They're</a> not always things that I want to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4621.418s">Someone</a> may contact me last minute and say, hey, can you put this on the agenda or can you do this or that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4626.085s">So</a> there's a lot of ways things find their way on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4630.331s">Maybe</a> we can offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4632.293s">you</a> know, because we'll offer things that the clerk may have in his hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4637.614s">So</a> we may call the clerk and we'll get a paper in our packet of something that's under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4642.655s">Maybe</a> there's a way of disseminating that to the distribution list that goes out from the city clerk's office, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4650.157s">Your</a> distribution list has hundreds and hundreds if not a thousand names on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4654.598s">Method</a> residents they get the agenda there may be some other ways of doing it rather than change the night I think it's admirable if the council is looking for more public input which I look for and looking for transparency I'm not quite sure this provides that this Avenue Thank You mr. Thank You councillor marks

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4962.079s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4974.633s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4975.614s">This</a> was tabled from, I think, last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4978.398s">And</a> I'm a little surprised that such a major change to our rules would be requested without at least going to the Rules Committee and have some discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4990.953s">So</a> I am a little surprised that it's being moved forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4994.855s">However,</a> that's under the druthers of the person offering the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5000.197s">But</a> I would like to say that I think at the very least, it should be sent for proper vetting to the Rules Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5008.181s">I</a> am not going to support it based on what I mentioned tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5011.542s">If</a> there are other options, I think they can be explored at Rule Committee, like Mr. Beers and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5016.665s">Morell</a> mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5018.005s">Councilor</a> Morell, and that would be the proper place to vet looking at other solutions maybe to this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5138.067s">the</a> time here on the floor, but I think it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5141.25s">I</a> thought it was a rule, and I'm not going to go through the rules, but I thought it was a rule that said there was a standing meeting Tuesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5147.935s">It</a> used to be 730. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5149.036s">We</a> changed it back some years ago to 7 o'clock to accommodate more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5152.98s">So</a> I thought it was a standing rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5154.621s">If</a> it's not a standing rule, I thought it may have been part of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5157.544s">There</a> has to be something that calls for the meeting of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5161.047s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5162.108s">So</a> whether it's the charter, whether it's a standing rule, it has to be written somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5166.752s">So</a> I don't want to take time now to discuss it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5184.052s">that</a> we meet Tuesday nights at 7 o'clock.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5190.074s">I</a> was always under the impression it was a two-thirds vote to change a rule.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5206.219s">We</a> have a committee of rules, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5208.059s">There</a> is a rules subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5209.02s">A</a> rules subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5210.24s">I</a> think that would be the appropriate party, but again, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5213.478s">It's</a> a motion on the floor, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5229.006s">Consular</a> Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5230.066s">Starting</a> when, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5232.908s">Tomorrow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5235.064s">We</a> adopted the standing rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5236.526s">We're</a> amending the standing rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5237.546s">It</a> will be effective next week.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5241.529s">What</a> about notification to the general public? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5243.471s">What</a> about... There's a lot more involved, Mr. President, than just changing a night. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5248.434s">If</a> we're talking about transparency, how do you change a night that's been established for 72 years and not be transparent about changing the night and alerting the general public?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5431.634s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5434.408s">What</a> do you say about a gentleman that served the residents of this community for 36 years in the law department? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5443.154s">Mark</a> was an outstanding city employee, an outstanding department head, a man of faith, a man of the law, and a true friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5457.148s">It's</a> something, Mr. President, that I think you should be very proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5460.731s">Because,</a> as you know, behind this reel, in general, issues can be very contentious. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5467.416s">And</a> there have been a number of occasions that Mr. Rumley had to come up and represent issues on behalf of the administration, on behalf of the city, that may have been in conflict with the council, or certain members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5480.746s">And</a> he always did it in a way, Mr. President, that I think was <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5485.669s">strictly</a> issue, it was never personal, and that's something I respected about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5491.877s">And</a> at the end of the day, you could put the issue aside, whatever side you were on, shake hands, and then go on being a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5501.948s">And</a> I want to congratulate him on 36 years of exemplary service to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5508.793s">I</a> wish him well on his retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5510.934s">I</a> hope we'll be able to tap his vast knowledge and resource that he has gained over the 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5519.78s">He</a> started out as assistant city solicitor and worked his way into the city solicitor role. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5525.464s">He's</a> a true family man and I'm proud to call him my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5530.367s">And</a> I just want to wish him well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5533.248s">And</a> I know we dedicated this meeting, but I'd also like to dedicate this meeting on behalf of our friend, City Solicitor Mark Rumley, and wish him and his family well, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6788.068s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6789.717s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6791.058s">I</a> believe the sidewalks are going to be replaced by Eversource when they get through Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6796.92s">So</a> remember we discussed, I think that might be in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6800.521s">So</a> that's actually a positive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6803.722s">I</a> just would caution, I'm not sure who from the Office of Community Development would show up, but where this is actively something, and the director, I believe, is the Secretary of Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6818.588s">that</a> they are very cautious about having any influence by anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6825.998s">So</a> I would just caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6830.655s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6830.935s">And</a> I think, I think Paul Moki, the, the building commissioner who attends those meetings and it's actually sits on, I think the board would probably be a good person to give us an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6843.243s">I</a> know he tends, I don't know if he sits on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6844.884s">I</a> know he, I know he attends the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6847.386s">Um,</a> but I just would be cautious on, uh, having anyone that may be potentially be involved in a vote coming before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6857.572s">I</a> just want to put that out there.<h2><a href="../2020-04-17_MCM00000002/2020-04-17_MCM00000002.html">Medford City Council 02-26-19</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=313.237s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1146.636s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1600.305s">Just</a> if I could, on line with Councilor Caraviello, I would just ask also if we can send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce and maybe we can work through the Chamber of Commerce to have them alert their business owners regarding the sign ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1618.972s">And</a> if anyone needs <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1620.707s">to</a> be enlightened on what the current, because the sign on ordinances is rather lengthy and new businesses may not be that familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1628.512s">So</a> I would ask as a first step that we also send a letter to the president of the chamber asking that they contact their membership also about adhering to the local sign ordinance.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1693.617s">Mr.</a> President, move to waive the reading and if a brief synopsis could be given.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1976.244s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1977.345s">And</a> I, too, want to thank my council colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1980.326s">Last</a> week's motion was to have the city solicitor draft language <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1986.288s">around</a> a city ordinance, but the language wasn't clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1993.991s">There</a> really wasn't any language, just a direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1997.453s">And</a> clearly we have something to work from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2000.474s">So</a> this was very helpful and I appreciate the fact that Councilor and I did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2005.296s">As</a> I stated last week, and I'll state again publicly, Mr. President, on private property of homeowners, I believe homeowners should have the right to remove a tree on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2015.945s">If</a> we're talking about development with large developers that are coming in and declaring land and so forth, I think that's worthy of an ordinance to protect our shade trees and our trees that might be endangered. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2029.859s">And</a> I would support that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2033.222s">I</a> also want to state an ordinance is great, and we can follow an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2038.031s">But</a> we also have to put our money where our mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2041.033s">And</a> in the last several budgets, there is a pittance of money to replace shade trees within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2049.698s">And</a> Aggie Tudin was good enough to respond back. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2053.02s">I</a> believe it was the next day from the council meeting regarding something that Councilor Caraviello brought up about the, if someone buys a tree, the city will match the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2065.562s">And</a> Aggie Toonan came back right away, our tree warden, and said, that's a great program, and it's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2070.665s">I</a> mentioned the Back of the Curb program, which I believe at the time, and don't quote me, but there's been a dozen or so trees this year planted on private property that the city will purchase a tree for $500, $600, $700 at the request of the homeowner and plant a tree on private property in areas that <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2093.313s">You</a> probably couldn't put a tree because the sidewalk may be too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2097.476s">It</a> may be a tough intersection to put a tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2101.198s">And</a> I think that's an important program too that we run, but needs to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2106.821s">So</a> as part of the ordinance, I'm also going to push in budget time that we increase our funding for our public shade trees within the community too, Mr. President, because I believe they go hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2116.647s">And</a> I want to thank my colleague for bringing this up tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2283.795s">I'll</a> take that title, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2286.661s">I'll</a> take any title. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2290.404s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2293.747s">It</a> was about two months ago we had a person from the Library Foundation Committee appear before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2302.614s">It</a> was at the request of I think it was Councilor Lungo-Koehn at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2306.737s">And</a> the advisor that was hired by the Library Foundation with the mission of raising private funds <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2316.418s">to</a> help with the capital campaign towards a $34 million public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2322.441s">As</a> we all remember, the city of Medford was awarded a $12.3 million grant from the Mass Board of Library Commissioners to construct this $34 million library. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2334.467s">And</a> the advisor that appeared before the podium stated, based on their <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2340.143s">recent</a> outreach and discussion among the Library Foundation group and their different outreach, they anticipate to raise about $3.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2356.989s">The</a> reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, and I mentioned it two months ago that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting, this is a very vital financial economic issue in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2368.373s">And</a> the reason why I bring it up is at the time when we were building a new library, or plans to build a new library, it was mentioned that a $34 million library, based on $12.3 million grant, would leave us paying over $18 million for a balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2391.25s">And</a> at the time, it was Mayor Burke that mentioned that she was going to raise privately <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2397.752s">the</a> amount of the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2399.953s">So</a> she was going to go out and raise $12.3 million privately, the amount of the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2404.756s">And</a> this was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2406.276s">This</a> isn't just off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2408.658s">It</a> was stated on two occasions publicly, one during November 2017, that Mayor Burke said she was hopeful donations would be able to match the funds from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2422.137s">And</a> this is her quote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2424.258s">We're</a> very optimistic from those that have already been interviewed and people that we have reached out to that we'll be able to parlay the state grant, double it with foundation money, and then be left for the city to put up a piece of about $5 million, which is our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2442.085s">We</a> had the foundation advisor appear before us stating $3.5 million was probably an aggressive figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2451.948s">But</a> that was what they were looking to raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2454.749s">And</a> I asked Barbara Kerr, the library director, when she was at the podium, I stated to her unequivocally, where is the $12.3 million that you're going to raise privately? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2466.074s">And</a> Barbara Kerr, who has been involved with this library planning from day one, said, oh, I never heard of that figure before. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2474.277s">Where</a> did that figure come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2475.857s">And</a> I said, well, it came from the mayor of this city that it was going to be raised privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2480.662s">So</a> that's why I keep on raising the issue, Mr. President, because as time goes on now, and we have yet to hear back from the Library Foundation, and I'm sure they're doing yeoman's work, reaching out to people, trying to gather money, but as time goes on, there's going to be a rather large commitment outstanding for the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2501.391s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, can't turn back to taxpayers and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2505.873s">They</a> may have made a commitment, but the $12.3 million they may have said they were going to get, they only got $3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2512.457s">So</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2513.838s">You're</a> going to pay the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2517.199s">That</a> may have been a game changer, Mr. President, at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2522.31s">So</a> when you look at the figures, $12.3 million grant, the foundation money that they're saying, just say $3.5, it may be more, it may be less, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2530.773s">Maybe</a> they'll raise the whole amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2532.354s">I</a> don't know, but I don't get a warm, fuzzy feeling to date regarding the private funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2538.056s">So</a> that's $15.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2541.237s">You</a> take that from the $34 million, it leaves you a balance of $18.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2550.555s">We</a> have to start discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2552.677s">We</a> should be having, if not weekly, monthly meetings with the library, with the administration, saying, how are we going to pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2562.185s">And</a> I don't want to hear, well, year one, we're all set for year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2565.287s">There's</a> year two. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2566.168s">There's</a> year three, four, five, six. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2568.63s">There's</a> other projects in line, like the fire department, Mr. President, like the high school, like the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2579.547s">The</a> fire station, the plans that were made with the fire station were made based on the fact that private funds were going to be garnered to support this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2593.076s">Now,</a> if that doesn't come through, does that push the fire station from year 2024 to 2029, 2030? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2597.138s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2597.639s">And</a> no one's talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2604.977s">But</a> I'm going to continually bring it up, Mr. President, because it disturbs me when the director of the library that's been involved from day one never recalls a commitment made by the administration of $12.3 million being raised privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2618.904s">How</a> do you overlook that as the library director involved from day one? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2623.926s">That's</a> not a small little fact that you can overlook. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2627.468s">That's</a> huge how you're going to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2630.069s">So</a> again, Mr. President, respectfully, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2631.933s">I</a> asked that we have a meeting with the library foundation group that's set up and the library commissioners, I think they should be part of this also. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2641.315s">I've</a> spoken to library commissioners regarding this and they're eager to find out what's going on as well, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2650.596s">And</a> we have yet to get an answer from this administration other than the fact, in my opinion, that the mayor is hiding from her original commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2660.853s">Now,</a> if the mayor thinks she was too aggressive at the time, happened to be during a city debate for office, and maybe she was being a little overly aggressive to Ghana support. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2674.5s">But</a> now if that's the case, Mr. President, we still have to make ends meet with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2681.204s">And</a> according to my figures, there's an $18.2 million balance in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2690.145s">So</a> I would ask that we sit up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2691.406s">I</a> know we have a lot of Committee of the Wholes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2693.346s">We</a> joked about it tonight while we were in a Committee of the Whole meeting with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2698.389s">But</a> we really need to sit down as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2701.28s">because</a> it was the council that took this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2703.541s">This</a> was a very difficult vote regarding public safety, regarding a new library, which I don't think anyone feels that we didn't need at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2711.584s">But</a> we were sold a bill of goods. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2713.925s">This</a> is what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2714.985s">This</a> is how we're going to afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2716.526s">And</a> now if this is not how it's going to happen, and this is not how we're going to afford it, we should know how it's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2724.148s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2899.987s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2900.848s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2904.27s">If</a> people aren't aware, Councilor Caraviello was one of the first people to start <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2908.43s">speaking</a> about the poor condition of our public library where our students go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2912.751s">And</a> I think he was one that first raised many of the concerns with the leaks and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2917.672s">So</a> I want to thank him for his efforts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2921.253s">I</a> just, I don't want people to think for a second that I don't want to see funds raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2926.674s">I'm</a> hoping that we raise the full amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2929.295s">I</a> just think we should have a contingency plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2932.555s">And</a> if that doesn't work out, how are we going to pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2936.579s">And</a> it's unfortunate when the mayor can sit back and say, well, if that doesn't work out, we have 60,000 people out here that are going to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2946.023s">That's</a> not the way we should operate government, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2949.484s">And</a> there should be, if there's none established now, like they're changing the rules on how they're going to raise money and so forth and different ways of raising money, then we should have a contingency plan on how are we going to afford this if the expectations <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2966.466s">of</a> what the mayor stated, the 12.3 matching private money doesn't come through, how are we going to gather that money to pay for this library? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2975.893s">And</a> if we can't afford it, what are we going to do, Mr. President, moving forward?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3228.449s">I</a> appreciate you being so candid with us, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3231.428s">If</a> it's a private organization, why is our treasurer collector, Anne Marie Irwin, sitting on the committee?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3239.751s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3239.951s">So</a> someone from the administration, a city employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3243.672s">I'm</a> a city employee, so I. Right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3246.213s">Is</a> sitting on this committee, but the mayor has nothing to do with this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3265.145s">And</a> I hope you do.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3926.377s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3928.438s">I,</a> too, want to go on record thanking Councilor Scarpelli, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3932.575s">It</a> was under his leadership calling for this meeting, getting the players at the table, having DOT sit around the table, having the district office there, not just the people that are responsible for the day-to-day activities, but the engineers from our district, from DOT were present, and people that can make decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3954.281s">So</a> it was very helpful to have them there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3956.781s">I</a> think it was insightful, which was offered by Councilor Scarpelli, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3960.664s">The</a> fact that DOT kept on stating to us they have to adhere to <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3965.486s">state</a> and federal guidelines and regulations regarding signage, regarding traffic lights, and much of which prevents them from doing what we would like to see them do, which is provide some pedestrian safety in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3980.297s">And</a> it was under Councilor Scarpelli's motion that within the next, I think it was 30 or 45 days, that we reconvene with some short-term fixes for that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3993.866s">And</a> I believe they're going to come back with a number of short-term fixes, whether it's a raised crosswalk, whether it's additional signage, whether it's changing that just blinking light to a steady light for the time being. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4005.212s">They're</a> going to come back with something, Mr. President, in my opinion, that's going to improve that section. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4011.317s">And</a> I would just put out a challenge to my colleague that that is one intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4016.2s">I</a> have about another 75 on a list that we need to look at, and I'm sure he'll be eager to take them one at a time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4502.347s">Mr.</a> President, I reviewed the records, find them to be in order, and move approval.<h2><a href="../2024-03-13_MCM00000049/2024-03-13_MCM00000049.html">Medford City Council 02-19-19</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=64.555s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=67.136s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=68.277s">Mr.</a> President, also we have a related paper 19-064. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=71.278s">I</a> ask that we also take that out of order in conjunction with the paper you just listed.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=151.045s">Mr.</a> Blake, could you shut that off, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=153.587s">I'm</a> sure the glare is bad enough without that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=399.269s">Mr.</a> President, maybe if the gentleman could just give us an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=402.412s">I</a> know we just received a response from Melrose-Wakefield in the DPH letter that they sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=413.81s">regarding</a> the closure of the emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=417.093s">If</a> you can just give us a brief update on where that stands right now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=454.774s">So</a> I had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=456.054s">I'm</a> not sure if you're able to answer it or not, but I had the opportunity to read through the response submitted by your organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=466.351s">And</a> I had just a question regarding travel times. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=470.734s">So</a> this is a response back to DPH, letting them know that when and if and when LMH does close its emergency room, that there are alternative plans, meaning other emergency departments in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=488.324s">And</a> the report that I viewed mentioned about Armstrong Ambulance Service <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=496.113s">and</a> the times it takes to get to different facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=499.716s">Do</a> you know what percentage of emergency room visits based on actual ambulance service?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=517.77s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=519.376s">I</a> would assume the information that was in the report regarding travel times that the data was obtained from Armstrong Ambulance only included <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=532.528s">the</a> ambulance at these particular locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=535.489s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=536.369s">So</a> when they say that the drive time for Method residents to Melrose Wakefield Hospital is seven to 10 minutes, I assume that's in an ambulance that's going full-blown sirens, breaking many rules and regulations, getting to a hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=555.656s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=599.569s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=600.69s">I</a> think it's important that, and I'm sure DPH will do their own homework, the Department of Public Health, but it's important to know how these figures were arrived at. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=610.774s">And,</a> you know, not everyone arrives at an ambulance <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=614.364s">ambulatory</a> setting by ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=617.486s">And</a> anyone traversing this community knows that it could take you 10 to 15 minutes just to get from, you know, Wellington to Medford Square, let alone West Medford, which might be another 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=632.296s">So</a> I think these particular travel times are concerning for me as a resident and someone that potentially could need emergency service <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=642.955s">to</a> know the distances between alternatives when we had an emergency service right in our own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=649.639s">So</a> that's the first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=651.9s">The</a> second point is based on just the annual emergency room data. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=657.164s">And</a> I've stated this publicly a number of times regarding the closure of the emergency room, that the statistics will bear out and the statistics that were provided show from 2016 to 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=673.178s">with</a> 2019 being annualized, because it's not a full fiscal year, but it does show the volume in emergency visits to Lawrence Memorial dramatically decreasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=684.341s">For</a> instance, 2016, it was 12,514 visits. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=685.241s">2017</a> was 11,925. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=685.361s">2018</a> was 9,289. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=685.761s">And</a> if you annualize 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=701.157s">we're</a> looking at about 7,520 emergency room visits. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=705.699s">So</a> you can see there's been a decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=707.94s">But</a> as I stated on many occasions, the decline is not due to the services that the hospital is offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=715.184s">For</a> many years, that hospital emergency room was a robust emergency room and provided great service to residents and people that lived in surrounding communities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=726.329s">But</a> if you look back over the years, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=729.082s">And</a> for instance, in 2014, when the Health Policy Commission reviewed Partners Healthcare Systems' proposed acquisition of Hallmark Health, they mentioned, and this is September 2014, that Hallmark Lawrence Memorial Hospital would become a 30 to 40 bed facility for ambulatory care and short stay inpatient care lasting three days or fewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=756.455s">operated</a> under the MGH license. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=758.816s">We</a> know that never came to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=761.516s">It</a> also goes on to say Hallmark LMH would have an urgent care center, certain expanded outpatient services, and Parton is also committed to keeping LMH emergencies department open during at least the transition period of LMH's conversion, which they estimated take two or three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=782.482s">So</a> as far back as 2014, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=785.515s">which</a> are prior to the numbers I just gave regarding volume. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=790.857s">Uh,</a> there has been the word out there either was partners or Hallmark that there was a steady move to close the ambulatory care at Lawrence Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=804.141s">And</a> there was decisions made by the hospital to go in a different direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=811.684s">And</a> I think what we saw was services over the years, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=815.618s">somehow</a> start to filter over to Melrose Wakefield Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=820.581s">And</a> the decline was not because of a lack of service within our community or a lack of need. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=828.326s">It</a> was because of an administrative decision that was made to cut out ambulatory service or surgical ER service within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=839.894s">And</a> that same article went on to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=841.978s">Hallmark</a> Melrose Wakefield would remain an acute care hospital under the Hallmark license. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=848.584s">The</a> hospital received an estimated $152 million worth of substantial renovation, including expansion capacity of their ER. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=857.532s">2015</a> Method Lawrence Memorial Hospital would likely close if Hallmark Health merger fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=866.359s">And</a> it goes on to say, in its August 2014 <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=869.936s">letter</a> to the Health Policy Commission, Hallmark said it faced significant financial challenges and had implemented significant cost-saving initiatives in fiscal 2014 after seeing a 23% decline in patient discharges at LMH and Melrose-Wakefield Hospital over the previous two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=892.349s">So</a> it wasn't just LMH that was supposedly losing emergency business. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=898.597s">It</a> was also Melrose-Wakefield, according to this particular article. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=906.022s">In</a> 2016, Hallmark Health nears merger with Tufts Medical Center, parent company Wellforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=917.15s">And</a> in 2016, it says Hallmark Health, which owns Medford Lawrence Memorial Hospital, Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, Melrose, and a handful of smaller sites around greater Boston represents <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=928.582s">295</a> million in revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=931.203s">The</a> details of the Hallmark's merger with Welforce have not been finalized, but will likely include capital investment at Hallmark facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=939.946s">Hallmark</a> officials hope to build a new emergency care wing at Melrose Wakefield Hospital that is at least three times the size of the current ER. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=950.39s">So</a> as you can see, there's a pattern over the years of taking from Lawrence Memorial and adding to Melrose Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=958.335s">So</a> I think it's very disingenuous when we're showing DPHR numbers, strictly numbers saying, hey look, it doesn't appear that Method can support an emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=969.52s">From</a> a financial standpoint, as a hospital, we can't afford it anymore to have an emergency room in Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=975.742s">And</a> I think it's disingenuous to state that when clearly there was an administrative decision over many years to close the emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=988.007s">at</a> Lawrence Memorial, a thriving emergency room, and come out with an outpatient clinic that we're talking about now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=995.695s">So</a> I just want to state that publicly and go on record that I don't think it was any lack of demand in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1004.083s">I</a> still believe there's a strong need for emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1007.426s">We</a> have one of the highest percentages <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1010.232s">of</a> seniors in the Commonwealth living in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1014.535s">And</a> as you know, an emergency room is very important, not just to seniors, but to all residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1020.299s">And</a> this is going to have a real dramatic impact on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1025.443s">And</a> I'm hoping still there's some hope with DPH that they will deny the closure of your request for closure of Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1035.13s">And</a> then we can discuss other options about what's going to happen <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1038.919s">internally</a> within the hospital, about other outpatient services, and also look at the proposal that you're offering regarding an ambulatory care. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1050.247s">But</a> I just want the record to reflect the numbers that were mentioned in your report, as well as the drive times. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1056.051s">I</a> think it's important to clarify the drive times also to these other emergency rooms.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5308.996s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5309.996s">While</a> we have representatives from the hospital here, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5312.707s">I</a> had a question regarding interaction with the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5318.909s">Has</a> there been any on-site meetings with the Medford Fire Department in regards to the placement of your ambulatory care building and where it's situated in comparison to the nursing school?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5366.482s">by</a> the method fire department relative to the <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5369.558s">the</a> placement of the ambulatory surgical center in front of a building that may not be sprinkled up to code?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5406.273s">As</a> part of the mitigation, is it potentially possible that the building could be relocated?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5500.038s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5501.479s">Um,</a> uh, myself and council Lungo attended the neighborhood meeting last week and as part of some of the conditions that were raised by the neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5511.275s">There</a> were a number of conditions that were raised that may not fall under the purview of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and something we as a community could be looking into. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5521.322s">I</a> know signage was an issue on some of the roads on Joyce and Hutchins. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5528.568s">There</a> was talk about maybe resident permit parking, which would alleviate some of the concerns of people parking on those particular roads that may be employed or going to Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5539.354s">But</a> there were a number of issues that we really don't need to wait on Lawrence Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5544.296s">And</a> I'm not sure at what point we as a council can forward some of these recommendations to either the traffic commission or whether it be the mayor's office to act upon these issues, because there's no reason to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5558.441s">So</a> I would ask that as part of the committee report tonight, that we formulate a response that addresses some of the conditions within the <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5567.98s">neighbor's</a> concerns and start working on those immediately, things that really don't need involvement by Lawrence Memorial Hospital.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5587.939s">I</a> think it may, I don't think we should do it here on the floor, but maybe a committee of the whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5596.303s">To</a> talk about some of the conditions.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5599.545s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6677.57s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6680.347s">One</a> of the issues that I think Councilor Caraviello was alluding to was the fact that signs that are internally illuminated can pose a concern within neighborhood settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6692.791s">And</a> I know the other sign that was denied that was approved by this council, we requested special conditions on the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6701.954s">And</a> I'm not sure if you're willing to make that tonight, but that would be my vote for support. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6707.673s">that</a> the sign be turned off no later than 8 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6712.675s">I</a> believe that was the special permit we put. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6716.057s">And</a> we could check with the city clerk, Mr. President, to see what conditions we'll put on the last sign.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6727.213s">Well,</a> and we've called code enforcement on them between you and I, and now the whole city knows about it, but they were, they were in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6735.534s">And</a> I want to make sure that we as a council are consistent when we approve these signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6741.136s">I</a> would prefer to sit down in the subcommittee meeting, talk about the sign, talk about the illumination, talk about hours of operation, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6749.968s">and</a> then move forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6752.63s">I</a> think that's a better way of operating where this was already denied by the billing department. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6758.955s">We</a> would be happy to meet any special conditions that you have.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6766.5s">Business,</a> economic development, and science.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6781.031s">To</a> approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6781.871s">To</a> approve moving it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6800.437s">Subcommittee.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6824.563s">Signs.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6825.404s">Signs.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6825.644s">To</a> discuss with the petitioner the conditions that we'll discuss.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6834.088s">Councilor</a> Dello Russo, I'll mind.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8287.883s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8289.544s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8290.846s">I</a> was just wondering maybe if the Director of Community Development could share with us potentially some of the reasoning behind some of the figures that were arrived at within the Community Development Board's recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8307.179s">For</a> instance, the number of units that they arrived at was 10 units.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8323.208s">They</a> agreed with the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8324.048s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8324.589s">So</a> maybe my question is to my colleagues then, because it's been mentioned to us that most of the surrounding communities start off at six units rather than 10 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8336.636s">Why</a> did we start off at a much higher number of units where affordability is <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8343.352s">I</a> don't want to put anyone on the spot, but if the surrounding communities are all doing it, you know, why would we start, you know, at probably 40% higher than what they're doing?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8377.383s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8378.364s">So</a> my recommendation would be, and we could do with this at any point, but I agree with the lessening of the units. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8387.412s">I</a> feel very strongly that <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8389.717s">especially</a> where Winchester, Arlington, Everett, Somerville all start off at six units, that we should be also starting off at six units regarding the affordability component. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8402.153s">Also,</a> Mr. President, it's mentioned, you know, the term affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8407.063s">And</a> when you talk to different people, I actually work for the Department of Housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8410.867s">And</a> when you talk to different residents and you start talking about the median income and what exactly does affordable housing mean, it's not very affordable, affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8424.899s">And</a> I think anything we can do as a city to open that up to residents and truly make it affordable, I think that's what we should be exploring. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8434.418s">especially</a> in an economy, Mr. President, that, you know, we're looking at outrageous amounts for a one-bedroom, a two-bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8445.223s">You</a> can almost guarantee any new construction for a one-bedroom in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8449.245s">You're</a> close to $2,000, maybe even $2,200, $2,400 for a one-bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8455.248s">You</a> know, and then it goes up as the number of beds, naturally, rooms increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8461.191s">But</a> I think those are the tweaks that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8463.896s">And</a> I'm not opposed to doing it at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8468.437s">I</a> just would hate to have to reinvent the wheel and go through the whole process again where we can make some tweaks now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8475.518s">So</a> I'm not opposed to making some tweaks now to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8479.339s">Mr.</a> President, this may not be the appropriate forum here, but I'm not opposed to making some worthy tweaks that really address some of the affordability issues in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8492.522s">You</a> know, I hear all too often people can no longer live in our community, and that troubles me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8498.565s">It</a> really does, not just for younger people, like my own kids that would like to live in the city someday but probably can't afford it, but people that are actually living here, seniors and families and working people that can no longer live in a community that they grew up in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8512.791s">And</a> I think these are the issues that we have to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8515.925s">And</a> maybe it's small in stature by changing the numbers and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8521.87s">But</a> I think every little bit helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8524.512s">And</a> so that's what I'm going to be pushing for, whether it's tonight or this meeting that Councilor Scarpelli called for.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8667.517s">Just</a> if I could, knowing the process and the number of readings it has to go through, would it be feasible to have a subcommittee meeting while this is going through the legislative process and amending it now, rather than going through a whole other process to tweak something that <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8684.455s">we</a> may all be in agreement with right now, because it has to go to a second reading where it gets published, a third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8692.066s">It</a> may be worthwhile for us to do it while this process takes place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8698.074s">Thank</a> you, Councilman Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8795.879s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8798.841s">So</a> it doesn't require a posting then?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8801.964s">A</a> posting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8813.253s">Okay,</a> so you're saying this is the 13th?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8845.273s">So</a> our option tonight, I was under a different impression, but our option tonight is either to tweak and make changes, which is our prerogative to this, or approve it as Councilor Knight mentioned, and then at a later date, move towards some amendments to this, which, you know, hopefully will be quick, but who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8869.951s">You</a> know, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8871.711s">That's</a> why I was hoping we can try to put some of this stuff through tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8875.514s">So</a> that'll be the druthers of the council if they. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8879.136s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9901.667s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9902.768s">Josephine</a> was a longtime Method resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9905.41s">She</a> was a beloved wife, mother, loving grandmother, and great-grandmother. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9910.173s">And</a> she was truly a tremendous woman, and she will be sorely missed in this community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11683.159s">So</a> just so I understand, who ultimately has the final say on a bus route?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11718.06s">So</a> is the city of Medford signed off on this particular route that you're showing us tonight?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11802.282s">So,</a> so, so you've already received approval from the city to use that as a route, this temporary route, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11811.068s">And</a> you're coming before the council because it's the council's jurisdiction to create bus stops, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11816.272s">To</a> approve bus stops.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11819.774s">So</a> you would think that when the city was doing their due diligence, they would have notified residents in the impacted areas, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11828.568s">and</a> said, hey, this is what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11831.329s">And</a> I appreciate all the meetings you're saying took place in Somerville and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11835.43s">That</a> has not happened in our community, not from the phone calls I've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11840.452s">So</a> just so you know, the input has not happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11845.713s">And</a> that's very alarming to me that a route could be created like that without proper notification of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11856.337s">So</a> I just want to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11858.455s">The</a> second point, you know... Well, it is a detour route.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11928.188s">So,</a> Mr. President, if I could.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11931.209s">So,</a> Mr. President, clearly from day one, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11937.633s">Somerville</a> has been driving this GLX project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11940.275s">It's</a> no secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11941.516s">Medford</a> has taken a backseat every inch of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11944.138s">And</a> I think what we're seeing now is some of the results of Medford taking a backseat. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11950.403s">We</a> have an advisory board that's done Yeoman's work, but the city administration has been nowhere on this issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11957.928s">And</a> Somerville's driving the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11960.37s">Somerville</a> is driving the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11962.271s">So</a> when they say we don't want it to go down this particular street, as Councilor Knight said, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11966.255s">We'll</a> have it go through six miles of method.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11977.106s">But</a> it's temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11978.027s">You</a> just said it's temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11979.068s">You</a> made it sound like it's temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11981.29s">We're</a> doing it temporary because it's temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11989.049s">So,</a> Mr. President, I think part of the frustration, you just happen to be bearing the message, so don't take it personal, but part of the frustration... Don't shoot the messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11997.915s">Part</a> of the frustration is this council has requested to meet with the T for years, and they've blown us off for years, and they only come before us when they need something. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12007.601s">We've</a> asked the T not just for moving bus stops and so forth and signage, we asked about bus shelters. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12014.542s">You</a> can count on one hand, in a city this size with all the bus routes, how many bus shelters we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12020.828s">So</a> we'll have, not many is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12023.03s">So</a> we have routes where hundreds of residents stand when it's pouring rain, snowing, and we can't get a bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12031.058s">We</a> can't get the T to recognize a stop in Medford Square, West Medford, Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12036.89s">And</a> that's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12037.891s">It</a> really is a shame that we can't work in cooperation with the T, who's charging us millions of dollars off our cherry sheet every year to operate the T in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12048.577s">We</a> pay for this access. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12051.238s">We</a> pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12051.659s">It</a> comes directly off our cherry sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12055.481s">So</a> I think this is, and I'm not directing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12057.922s">I</a> know you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12058.823s">I'm</a> not directing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12059.763s">Part</a> of the frustration is that <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12061.494s">the</a> T's unwillingness to meet with us, talk about issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12064.997s">We</a> don't want him here every night, but when we ask him to talk about an issue, they should really present someone and not just blow us off. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12072.702s">So</a> I think that's part of the- I think that's another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12075.644s">It</a> is another issue, but unfortunately, you know, you're here tonight requesting something of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12083.85s">So,</a> you know, I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12086.112s">This</a> needs to go somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12087.352s">I</a> just think the lack of notification, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12090.297s">in</a> this community is appalling. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12092.758s">We</a> get calls every day, reverse 9-1-1 calls, telling me about things that I really don't care about, to be quite honest with you, but something that impacts that there may be a new route on your street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12105.023s">Those</a> are the type of notifications that should be going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12108.244s">This</a> is not to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12109.005s">This</a> is to the city that are laxing, and they can fall back on meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12114.867s">This</a> was how, let's face it, you know, people don't attend meetings for the most part, unless you're directly impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12121.41s">So,</a> uh, Mr. President, I think I'm going to join my colleagues tonight, uh, not supporting this unless the T can come back with us and say other options were explored, uh, about routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12132.574s">And</a> I'm very disappointed that the city of Medford, this administration would sign off on a proposal, Mr. President, without even talking to this Medford city council, who has direct authority over bus stops, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12145.315s">and</a> mention and have a dialogue with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12149.736s">Very</a> disappointed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14810.649s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14811.99s">And,</a> you know, some time back, a few years ago, the city was looking, and I think it was Roberta Cameron at the time, offered a suggestion about adopt a tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14824.338s">And</a> it was actually having the city plant trees on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14829.541s">So</a> if I was a homeowner and <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14831.483s">The</a> city approached me and said, we'd love to put a tree at the corner of High and Elm Street or wherever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14836.744s">Would</a> you like to have it on your property? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14838.004s">We'll</a> pay for the tree and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14841.045s">It</a> never went anywhere, the program, but I thought it was a great suggestion in increasing our trees in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14849.347s">I,</a> however, have a problem with creating a permitting process to remove a tree on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14857.063s">Now</a> if it's a new development that's in an area that as Councilor Knight referred to, I wouldn't have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14867.026s">But</a> I do have a problem with telling a resident that there may be a list of certain protected trees that you want to remove one. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14875.935s">And</a> we're looking at either you may need to relocate the tree, and who knows how much that would cost, depending on the size of the tree and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14885.999s">You</a> may need to replace it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14887.539s">You</a> may need to pay a permit to have it removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14892.201s">I</a> think it's a very slippery slope, Mr. President, that we're going down when we start getting involved in people's private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14901.024s">We're</a> all in favor of shade trees and doing whatever we can <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14904.645s">in</a> this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14906.526s">But</a> I think it's an overreach, to be quite frank with you, to start dictating to people whether or not they can cut a tree down on their own private personal property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14917.508s">So</a> I have a real problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14919.769s">If</a> you're talking about new development and maybe just that angle, I could support the city solicitor looking into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14926.871s">But</a> a general broad brush, Mr. President, of saying that everyone now has to go through a permitting process <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14934.817s">to</a> take down a tree or make sure it's not a particular tree or relocate a tree, I think it's a burden on residents of this community and something that I could not support, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14945.648s">So</a> I appreciate what the council is trying to do, but I think there may be other ways, as I believe it's called Back of the Curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14953.496s">Roberta</a> may be able to speak to that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14956.199s">I</a> think it's called Back of the Curb program, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14958.557s">the</a> city would go in and encourage private homeowners to plant trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14962.658s">And</a> I think that's an excellent concept and I would support that, um, you know, uh, in order to increase our, uh, trees and the different types of trees in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14973.04s">But,</a> uh, you know, uh, you know, reaching into someone's personal property, Mr. President, I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14980.401s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14981.001s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14981.341s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15151.418s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15152.979s">Just</a> if I could, because once we ask as a council, the city solicit to create an ordinance based on what's being submitted to us, I have a concern with the language that's in this, because the council is saying not to preclude someone from taking down a tree, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15171.675s">but</a> it also says there's a permitting process and certain trees are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15176.578s">So</a> I don't know, are there certain trees that you're never going to be able to remove? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15180.56s">Are</a> there certain trees that you're going to have to relocate? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15185.542s">Everyone</a> now is going to, if you want to remove a tree, you're going to have to pay a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15189.584s">Here</a> goes another fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15190.565s">You</a> know, that's, we have a water fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15192.586s">Now</a> we've got a fee on everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15194.187s">That's</a> create a fee to move a tree or take down a tree on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15199.376s">Next</a> they'll charge you for cutting your grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15202.137s">Uh,</a> if you, anytime you want to cut your grass, we'll charge you a fee for that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15205.618s">Um,</a> you know, it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15207.298s">It's</a> just another way of generating revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15210.619s">Um,</a> and, uh, if the mayor wants to create a tree fund, she can do it overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15217.181s">She</a> can do it overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15218.041s">If</a> she wanted to create a tree fund in this city, there's plenty of revenue streams right now that they could dedicate, uh, towards a tree fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15225.923s">If</a> that's what the mayor's intent was to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15228.253s">but</a> to add a permit charge on someone that wants to remove a tree for a host of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15234.375s">Most</a> people that contact me about trees and so forth on private property, after I'm done discussing, it's usually because the tree's ill or sick, and they're taking it down for a particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15246.199s">And</a> they're not just taking it down because they don't like trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15249.48s">So</a> I just, again, Mr. President, I'm not going to have the city solicitor spin his wheels on drafting something <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15258.247s">an</a> ordinance that I'm just opposed to reaching out to people on private property and requesting that they pay a fee, permitting fee, to remove a tree in their own property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15270.135s">So,</a> you know, we got to remember, we're looking at the snow shoveling ordinance now shifting the burden, requiring people to shovel intersections and pedestrian pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15282.963s">If</a> they don't do it, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15284.704s">They're</a> going to put a lien on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15287.501s">I</a> mean, we're really going down a slope here, Mr. President, one which I don't appreciate, to be quite frank with you, of how we dictate to residents rather than work with residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15300.907s">And</a> if the intent is to create, you know, more trees in this community, all you have to do is look at the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15308.204s">It</a> was this council for years, the city abused trees in the city for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15312.645s">They</a> used to use them just to put postings up throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15316.566s">I</a> mean, you go down the square, there was 10 dead trees there for years in the square alone, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15322.408s">Everyone</a> reckoned, and how many resolutions did we put forward to replace those trees or put trees that were more suitable for thoroughfares and so forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15334.848s">I</a> don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15335.928s">I</a> just think we've got to be very careful when we start looking at creating more permitting fees and making it difficult for someone on private property to do what they'd like on their own property, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15349.352s">Very</a> careful of having solicitors start creating ordinances and then present them to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15356.753s">And</a> you're going to be hard-pressed, Mr. President, to do something with it, let me tell you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15381.659s">Counsel</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15382.779s">So</a> based on what we're submitting here tonight, you're giving him a framework to draft an ordinance, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15388.981s">This</a> is a framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15390.122s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15391.042s">And</a> your framework talks about permitting <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15394.512s">making</a> people go through hurdles to cut down a tree on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15399.855s">So</a> that's what he's going to draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15401.076s">He's</a> not going to just come up with something different than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15403.797s">So</a> if that's the council's intent, to charge people on personal property to cut down trees, then you would say, solicitor, please go ahead, forward, and draft something. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15413.843s">I</a> don't support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15415.644s">So</a> I don't feel comfortable saying, go ahead and draft this, because I don't support this concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15420.327s">If</a> we want to look at other concepts, I'm more than happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15424.172s">But</a> this particular concept, I don't support. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15426.673s">So</a> I will not vote on it tonight to have the city solicitor move forward, because from the language I see here tonight, I don't support that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15434.676s">Thank</a> you, Counsel Knox.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15465.277s">This</a> council creates ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15467.599s">To</a> just pass a resolution off to the, an open-ended resolution off to the city solicitor to have him draft something, I think we're shirking our duties, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15479.689s">If</a> the council is that interested in it, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15481.803s">Have</a> them send it to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15483.164s">We</a> have plenty of subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15484.564s">Have</a> them look at language. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15486.145s">Mr.</a> President, at this point in time, I will withdraw my position.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15507.257s">So</a> to put out a resolution asking the city solicitor to craft an ordinance that conceptually I don't agree upon, and I think it's so open-ended that I don't think anyone behind this reeling could tell me how it would work, and then to take what he drafts and work that as a framework, I don't think makes any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15527.664s">Have</a> a subcommittee, get down, start brainstorming, put stuff down like we do with city ordinances, and then come up with something. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15535.273s">So</a> that's the only thing I'm saying, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15537.253s">So</a> I don't want my colleague to take exception, but that's the only thing I'm saying.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15581.439s">Whatever</a> the committee is, we should have the tree water in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15584.921s">We</a> should have anyone that's interested in this issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15589.783s">So</a> it shouldn't be just the council meeting on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15592.568s">It</a> should be the city administration, because we're eventually going to need a buy-in from the mayor and the city administration on this, if that's what they're interested in.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15860.191s">Also</a> in the Fells Plaza, right across from Modell's, there's a drop-off box that's manned eight hours a day, seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15875.538s">And</a> it's getting to be a business over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15879.56s">And</a> neighbors are very upset that live on the Fells Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15882.433s">because</a> I don't think the intent is to run a drop-off business of items there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15887.656s">And</a> like I said, it's staffed eight hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15890.918s">So</a> there's someone there, there's a big bin, they open the door up and they get deliveries all day there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15896.541s">And</a> then drop-offs at night, weekends, and it's becoming a real eyesore and a nuisance to the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15903.764s">So</a> I'd ask in the Fells Plaza that that be looked at by our code enforcement officer.<h2><a href="../2018-09-20_4DO7qbmEtOM/2018-09-20_4DO7qbmEtOM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 17, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=425.624s">Thank</a> you, school committee member DiBenedetto, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=429.046s">And</a> thank you to the school committee and Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=432.268s">I</a> had the unique opportunity to serve six years <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=435.635s">as</a> a member of the school committee alongside Lena DiGentimasso. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=439.357s">And</a> I can tell you unequivocally, she was the most dedicated, hardworking elected official that I've ever served with in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=447.68s">And</a> I've been doing this for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=450.802s">Back</a> in January 2018, I offered before the Medford City Council paper 18-006. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=456.764s">The</a> paper read, to recognize Lena DiGentimasso, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=463.354s">for</a> her 28 years of dedicated service to the children of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=467.695s">It</a> was passed unanimously by the city council and referred to the superintendent of schools and the school committee for further review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=476.017s">I</a> just would like, Madam Mayor, if you would indulge me just for a few moments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=481.478s">I</a> appreciate the dialogue that took place in the Committee of the Whole meeting tonight, and many of which current members have never had the opportunity like I had to serve with Lena <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=493.194s">and</a> you brought up some very valid questions about when and why do we bestow such an honor on someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=500.817s">And</a> I can just let you know that in my dealings with Lena, she was always straightforward, someone that you can count on, someone that was a person of their word, someone that was loyal to the utmost. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=518.785s">And</a> in her time as a member of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=522.183s">She</a> served with distinction for 28 years, but she was also a very active member of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=527.806s">And</a> that's why I think you have to look at someone's total resume, for not better words, when you look to honor someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=536.81s">And</a> I just would like to bring up a few things that I was able to dig up over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=541.593s">Lena</a> served for three decades on the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=545.115s">She</a> was a strong advocate for the Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=549.517s">She</a> was a strong supporter of the Curtis Tufts <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=552.018s">alternative</a> high school, a strong supporter of the fine arts department, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=557.148s">and</a> the high school band, of which was mentioned tonight by members of the school committee that back in the 90s when times were very lean, there were a lot of cuts going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=570.074s">And</a> I can remember firsthand that the arts were a major cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=575.596s">And</a> if it wasn't for Lena and her voice standing up to save the band and many other arts within our school department, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=586.404s">It</a> probably wouldn't have happened, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=589.406s">Lena</a> was the past president of the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=592.167s">She</a> was instrumental in the building of the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=594.768s">I</a> had the opportunity, along with Paulette van der Kloot, to actually climb to the roofs of many of our old school buildings, and Lena was the first up the ladder to the roof with her high heels and her dress on and her hair done to a tilt. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=611.355s">And</a> that was the type of person she was. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=613.916s">She</a> was dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=615.333s">to</a> the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=616.093s">I</a> mean, she really lived the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=620.114s">And</a> she also served with distinction as the PTA President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=625.315s">She</a> was selected by the Board of Directors of the Mass Association of School Committees and Corp to receive the Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=634.538s">She</a> received the Woman's Achievement Award from the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=638.138s">She</a> was the recipient of the Tip of the Hat Award from the Salem Street Business Association, received the Golden Mustang Award <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=645.28s">for</a> supporting the students of the Mustang athletic programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=648.822s">She</a> was instrumental in planning and development of the Gene Mack Youth Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=653.384s">She</a> received the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post-1012 Award in appreciation of leading the charge to have the McGlynn School Auditorium named in honor of the veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=664.549s">She</a> was honored by the Curtis Tufts Alternative High School graduation for many years of continued support. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=670.812s">She</a> received the Tony Lucci Golden Mustang Award <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=673.704s">for</a> being an outstanding athletic program supporter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=676.787s">She</a> served as president of the AARP, Medford Chapter, 1132. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=682.132s">I'd</a> also be remiss, Madam Mayor, if I didn't mention Lena's late husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=688.458s">If</a> you knew Lena, she was always with Alfred. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=690.82s">Wherever</a> you saw her in the city, it was Lena and Alfred. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=693.943s">Alfred</a> was a Korean War veteran and a Purple Heart recipient, and also her three children, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=700.626s">all</a> were educated in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=704.407s">So</a> I, too, think this is an honor that's long overdue and worthy of such a dedicated member of this community, not only to the schools and the children, but to the entire population of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=720.09s">And</a> I thank you all for your diligence on this, and I look forward to the day when we can call the band room the Lena DiGentimaso Band Room. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=729.813s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=773.053s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=774.013s">I</a> was wondering if we could hear from the petitioner where he's present tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=777.795s">Name</a> and address of the record, please.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=863.444s">Have</a> you read the current sign ordinance regarding how long the sign can be left on and so forth?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=872.592s">So</a> would you be willing to, now you're going to have a secondary freestanding sign?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=888.484s">So</a> is that going to be the same size as it currently exists? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=891.206s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=891.907s">So</a> it's not going to be any larger? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=893.269s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=894.47s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=895.343s">So,</a> Mr. President, I find no problem with this particular paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=899.944s">I</a> wish the gentleman that's been a long-standing site for physical fitness in the community, I wish him well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=907.407s">I</a> would just ask that he read the entire piece of the ordinance that was created some years ago regarding signage and what the rules and regulations are regarding signage.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1174.777s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1176.639s">We</a> typically request that any new appointments come before the council to stand here and let us know the position they've been appointed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1186.607s">These</a> are reappointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1188.008s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1189.309s">And</a> we've done that in the past for reappointments also. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1191.731s">It's</a> up to the druthers of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1193.407s">I</a> would prefer, Mr. President, because some of them are three, four-year appointments, I would ask that the reappointments also appear before us, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1239.418s">If</a> they come tomorrow night, we'll talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1243.859s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1344.475s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1880.894s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1881.234s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1883.076s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1884.257s">And,</a> uh, I want to speak from a firsthand knowledge that, uh, this happens to be a local park near my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1891.588s">And</a> I've spent countless hours in the play structure and the basketball court and you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1897.81s">And</a> I can tell you, I can't think of one other park in the community that's utilized to the fashion that this particular park is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1905.332s">It's</a> such a fashion that the neighbors take care of the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1910.254s">And</a> there's a little dome there where you can sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1913.575s">Neighbors</a> actually bring their supper out there and will eat within the park with their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1918.517s">It's</a> a real unique setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1920.447s">And</a> I believe this particular work is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1924.715s">And</a> the question I do have, Mr. President, is recently we created the Crystal Campbell Memorial Garden, which is a park area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1933.015s">We're</a> in the process right now of turning the Riverside Ave, which used to be a bus shelter, into park land and a new addition to the parks department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1946.763s">And</a> we're going to be spending multi-millions of dollars refurbishing our parks, but yet our park department hasn't grown at all, the staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1956.069s">And</a> in my opinion, you can't expand and create, especially parks that are going <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1961.897s">a</a> water addition, and similar to the Crystal Campbell PAC, that are going to require significant upkeep and not expand the staffing and the maintenance on these PACs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1973.441s">So</a> I would ask that during budget deliberation that the administration include ample amount of money to sufficiently increase the DPW staff, in particular, I know we need it in the highway, we need it in forestry, but in particular in the PACs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1990.433s">As</a> we all hear, we get the complaints when the baseball fields aren't lined properly in time, the grass is not cut, and it's not because they're not doing the job, it's because they're at bare bones capacity, which many of our departments are in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2004.281s">So</a> I would just ask that with the addition of these parks, we want to make sure in five years from now that the water facility at Harris Park, which is going to be a great addition, and I'd like to see more throughout the community, is still working after five years and properly maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2019.977s">And</a> as Councilor Longo-Curran mentioned, that when needs come up, that they're addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2025.721s">And</a> you can't do that with a skeleton crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2027.822s">So</a> that would be my one recommendation I make on this, Mr. President, that the city administration come back to this council during the budget with an appropriation to increase the staffing at DPW, in particular, in the parks department.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2674.88s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Marks to take suspension to take paper 18-296 and report that out.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2693.408s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2694.729s">We</a> met tonight as a council, Committee of the Whole meeting for an issue that was tabled or referred to the Committee of the Whole on March 20th, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2707.94s">This</a> paper was an appropriation of $1 million to fund a demolition and other costs for construction of the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2715.887s">We</a> had several discussions regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2720.697s">some</a> issues with tearing down the current training tower and police facility in order to make way for new headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2732.785s">And</a> I would ask that that committee recommendation be brought forward this evening, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3933.823s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3936.533s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3938.054s">And</a> I think it's important that we remember how this all originated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3944.097s">And</a> it was a year ago when this chamber was filled with police and fire and a number of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3951.121s">And</a> at the time, we were told that we couldn't build a combined center because it would require a proposition two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3960.846s">And</a> I remember the discussion and debate quite vividly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3964.328s">And</a> at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3965.928s">the</a> firefighters took a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3968.449s">And</a> they were the ones to say, you know what, if we can get a commitment, we're willing to postpone our fire station for several years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3978.833s">We're</a> willing to go without a tower until a new one's built. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3983.214s">And</a> they were the ones that stuck their neck out in the line more than anyone else, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3988.116s">And</a> it's ironic we're back here a year later with the firefighters in the same predicament. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3994.049s">And</a> I don't blame, and that's why I stand alongside them, Mr. President, I don't blame a single one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3999.19s">After</a> one year of hearing discussion and debate, after receiving a pledge or a commitment, whatever you want to call it, from the administration, that they would receive a new fire headquarters in 2021 or 2022, and to have the rug pulled out from underneath them and pushed down to 2026, which is another four or five years, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4023.142s">And</a> then to say, you'll get a training tower when that one comes down, this was a year ago, when the training tower comes down to make way for new police headquarters, a new one will go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4034.189s">And</a> we're a year out and none of those commitments are on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4041.214s">So</a> I don't know what track some of these Councilors are on, but it's clearly not a track that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4049.099s">It's</a> a one sided track. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4052.794s">And</a> the firefighters are absolutely correct when they talk about training. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4058.716s">I</a> mean, I don't work in that sector or that field, but I can imagine the intense training that's required by both police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4066.698s">In</a> the private sector, sitting at a desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4070.259s">We're</a> scrutinized every year and go through intensive training, working with numbers and paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4077.048s">Imagine</a> doing fire rescue, the intense training that's required. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4081.953s">And</a> to take that away not only puts their lives at risk, but every man, woman, and child and pet in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4094.367s">And</a> I don't think we could just brush over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4097.01s">I</a> really don't think so, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4099.484s">And</a> the conversations we had regarding state land, and I said this weeks ago, are going nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4106.289s">Did</a> they try? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4107.169s">I'll</a> give them an A for effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4108.57s">Did</a> they try? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4109.051s">Yes,</a> they tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4110.131s">But</a> they're going nowhere fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4113.354s">So</a> if we have to depend on getting state land, we're going to just keep depending on getting state land. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4119.918s">And</a> they're going to be in the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4123.681s">So</a> the commitments that were given a year ago have not fallen through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4129.431s">or</a> they have fallen through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4132.632s">So</a> where do we stand right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4134.653s">They're</a> exactly correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4135.953s">The</a> minute that tower comes down, it's going to be put on the back burner. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4141.095s">And</a> nothing's going to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4143.036s">Then</a> there's going to be another need that comes forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4145.257s">You</a> know, a community, I think you could tell a lot about a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4148.058s">When</a> a community doesn't put its time and effort and money into public safety, it says a lot about a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4156.321s">It</a> really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4158.324s">and</a> I think we're seeing that in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4161.146s">The</a> headquarters is one of six buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4165.97s">I'll</a> take anyone, if the reporter wants to go through, anyone that wants to go look at these other buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4171.555s">We</a> need to take them all down in one fell swoop, the condition of these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4175.758s">But</a> we're starting somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4177.199s">We're</a> starting with the headquarters because it was attached to the police station, which we all know needed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4183.565s">And</a> I agree also, and the police aren't here tonight, but how do you take a firing range <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4188.365s">away</a> from police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4191.667s">It's</a> unheard of, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4194.288s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4195.789s">We're</a> building a building undersized already because of monetary constraints. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4201.992s">Everywhere</a> I look, we're building in this community, receiving millions of dollars in new building fees, linkage money, millions of dollars in linkage money, new revenue coming in, thousands of new residents pouring into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4214.799s">It's</a> a hot commodity, but we can't afford <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4218.615s">to</a> rehab and build a station that's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4223.156s">It's</a> a matter of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4224.316s">That's</a> what I tell everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4225.377s">They</a> say, how come we can't do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4226.897s">And</a> you know what I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4228.517s">We</a> can't do it because this is not the mayor's priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4232.798s">And</a> that's what it boils down to. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4235.219s">Building</a> a park out here in Riverside Ave, that's the mayor's priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4239.04s">Building</a> giant big box residential buildings on Locust Street, that's the mayor's priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4246.322s">But</a> it's clearly not public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4250.391s">And</a> I didn't support tearing this down in the committee hall, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4254.012s">I</a> hope, after hearing some of the pleas from the fire department, that some of my colleagues have a change of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4260.973s">You</a> know, a 45-day is just what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4263.134s">It's</a> 45 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4265.414s">Did</a> we put a time limit on the revitalization of Medford Square, which has been going on, from what I can remember, from 2005? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4275.176s">Is</a> there a time limit on that, where it just ends? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4278.437s">But,</a> no, there's a time limit on the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4281.033s">We'll</a> get to a certain point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4282.714s">We'll</a> put some time limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4284.455s">And</a> if we can't meet our goal, we move on to something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4287.697s">It's</a> not fair, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4289.758s">And</a> commitments have to count for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4293.1s">A</a> politician is only as good as their word. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4297.423s">And</a> if people can't trust your word, then you're no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4301.045s">You're</a> no good, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4302.646s">And</a> I don't want to fall in that realm. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4305.188s">I</a> think we should extend the 45 days, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4309.22s">Let's</a> give it several more months to try to work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4313.663s">The</a> mayor's own committee that she put together when she became mayor looked at the revitalization of the square, looked at business and economic development, looked at a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4324.291s">And</a> guess what one of their major recommendations were? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4327.573s">To</a> build a new combined center on that exact location. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4331.275s">It's</a> in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4333.097s">That</a> was one of their recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4336.923s">Now,</a> that committee did yeoman's work, spent many, many months putting together all sorts of data. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4345.289s">So,</a> I plead with my colleagues, Mr. President, take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4350.554s">We're</a> not going to lose out on anything right now, taking a step back and taking a look at this picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4355.978s">Yes,</a> there was a lot of things brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4357.959s">I</a> brought up about wind casinos, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4360.761s">We're</a> going to receive a million dollars a year as soon as the casino opens for infrastructure in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4367.182s">i.e.,</a> public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4369.824s">What</a> better of a project? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4371.165s">To</a> earmark, as Councilor Knight mentioned, all we need is roughly a million dollars a year to take us over the hump. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4376.808s">That's</a> only one aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4379.23s">That's</a> only one aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4380.81s">We're</a> not talking about new growth, to be earmarked, linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4387.495s">So,</a> Mr. President, you know, a reason why we're in this situation is the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4393.511s">This</a> council has talked, I've been on the council a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4396.552s">We</a> wrote together a wish list of capital improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4400.233s">You've</a> been around, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4402.014s">And</a> what were the top one and two? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4403.915s">Does</a> anyone recall? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4405.335s">For</a> years, consistent, police and fire, one and two, police and fire, one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4415.779s">So</a> now we're at a predicament where we're doing number one without number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4419.92s">And</a> that could get painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4423.191s">You</a> ever do number one without number two? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4425.954s">It's</a> painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4428.376s">And</a> that's the situation we're in now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4431.719s">This</a> is becoming awfully painful, and it doesn't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4436.544s">Who</a> in this community doesn't think we need a new fire station? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4439.767s">Stand</a> up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4440.607s">Who</a> doesn't think we need a fire station? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4444.171s">Even</a> when the library people were here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4447.64s">When</a> the library people, I got more emails from library people after the fact saying, thank you, we knew that was a tough vote, but we want to be part of the fight to create a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4458.763s">Our</a> eyes were open that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4461.004s">We</a> didn't know what was going on in our public safety buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4464.065s">We</a> want to be part of that fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4466.746s">This</a> is an entire city fight, not just with the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4471.547s">Think</a> about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4472.247s">They</a> have to get up and fight on behalf of the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4476.53s">They're</a> not fighting for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4479.311s">They</a> don't want a new kitchen or a new bath. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4481.532s">They're</a> fighting for the entire city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4485.074s">That's</a> who they're fighting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4487.736s">And</a> they don't have all these different interest groups and friends of the fire department and so forth, and maybe they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4495.159s">But</a> this is a crucial, crucial item that we as a member of the council, us as councilors, have to stand up sometime and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4503.523s">We</a> have to do the right thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4505.527s">And</a> if the right thing is flexing our muscle, asking the mayor to come back to the table, which we were never at the table with her, by the way, but asking her to come back to the table and say, we are not going to move forward until we take another look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4519.858s">We're</a> not going to move forward until we take another look. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4522.1s">It's</a> too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4525.723s">I</a> think that's the right way to do it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4528.645s">I</a> respectfully ask my colleagues, I realize we took a vote and committed a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4533.228s">There's</a> nothing that precludes anyone from <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4535.74s">re-looking</a> after listening to new debate and dialogue to say, you know what, I'm at the point where I think we need to take another look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4544.562s">We</a> asked that we meet with the mayor every two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4548.403s">We've</a> had two meetings, and they've been somewhat productive, but we've had two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4554.404s">Let's</a> continue the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4557.385s">Let's</a> put out plan A, B, and C. We only saw plan A. We never saw a B and C, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4564.955s">We</a> got the email the night before the mayor was announcing where the new police station was going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4569.697s">The</a> night before we got the email inviting us to a press conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4574.939s">That's</a> when we got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4577.52s">So</a> we had no idea what was taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4579.541s">The</a> decisions were made in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4582.323s">And</a> we're just saying, let's revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4585.664s">We're</a> not that far down the road that we can't stop the process now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4589.566s">We're</a> really not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4591.547s">I</a> think we're right in the thick of things where we can't put a halt in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4595.629s">and</a> press the administration to sit down with this council and come to a resolve once and for all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4602.432s">That</a> would be my suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4604.152s">I</a> would ask any member of the council, respectfully, because I know this is not an easy decision, respectfully take a look at their vote, Mr. President, and revisit this for at least another 90-day period so we can continue our two-week meetings and discussions about a combined center and where we're going with the tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=4622.62s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6101.915s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6106.697s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6108.118s">You</a> know, I think we're at such a unique opportunity now where we have some leverage and able to negotiate this as a separate body <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6121.058s">You</a> know, they create separate bodies for a reason, as a check and balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6124.58s">We're</a> a separate body. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6127.202s">We</a> don't receive marching orders, or at least some of us don't receive marching orders from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6135.948s">And</a> I think we have the perfect opportunity now to sit back and revisit this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6143.513s">We're</a> under no obligation, Mr. President, to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6148.056s">And</a> there's been a lot of great ideas bantered around, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6150.972s">But</a> personally, I don't think it's very bold raising everyone's taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6157.395s">I</a> don't think that's a bold, creative idea, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6160.737s">My</a> own personal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6163.638s">It's</a> easy to raise people's taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6167.24s">You</a> know, I think we have to get more creative and hold people accountable to their words. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6173.163s">When</a> the mayor stands up during election time and say, when we build a new library, we're not only going to get 13 or 12.5 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6181.163s">in</a> a library fund grant through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6186.424s">I'm</a> also going to find 12 to 13 million in private funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6191.265s">I</a> think we need to hold the mayor's feet to the fire and say, Madam Mayor, where are these private funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6197.266s">Because</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6198.287s">When</a> they come through, we won't be having these discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6203.128s">We</a> will not be having these discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6205.967s">But</a> now we're hearing, after we approve the library, well, we've got to set up this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6210.069s">It's</a> going to take longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6211.169s">We</a> can't approach anyone yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6212.99s">And</a> the mayor, over a year ago, said that she had some donors lined up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6219.413s">There's</a> a tape on it, something about a rich uncle. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6223.474s">That's</a> what she said at the debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6226.892s">So</a> there had to be some consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6228.833s">You</a> don't just throw out a figure as the chief executive officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6232.815s">It'd</a> be irresponsible to say, I believe I can raise 13, 13 million is a ton of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6238.558s">And</a> if someone came to me and said, can you raise 13 million through private funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6242.16s">I</a> would take a step back before I made a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6245.162s">So</a> the mayor has to be privy to more than she's letting out there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6249.745s">And</a> if that's the case, all this discussion is in vain because we can afford to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6256.832s">And</a> that's why we need to keep these dialogue and discussions going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6261.353s">And</a> once we sever this relationship, and that's what's going to happen, once we stop meeting, I disagree with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6267.995s">You</a> know, I think meeting after meeting, and I've been doing this a long time, it may not seem productive, but as long as you're together discussing it, it's productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6276.518s">And</a> even if we're at the meeting, we feel nothing happened, we're together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6280.439s">For</a> too many years, Mr. President, we went without meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6284.68s">You</a> know, it was the laugh of the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6287.191s">for</a> 14, 15 years that the mayor, the former mayor never appeared before the city council ever for one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6295.576s">And</a> that's not the way I perceive city government working. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6298.418s">So</a> the fact that we're meeting with the mayor and the mayor agreed to do so, I think is productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6305.742s">Does</a> it get contentious because we have different ideas? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6308.143s">Yes,</a> but that's healthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6310.024s">We</a> can't all have the same idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6312.519s">And</a> we haven't explored that exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6314.5s">We</a> got some feedback, and the feedback we got looked positive, but we haven't explored it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6320.183s">I</a> don't think anyone behind this railing could say we really explored it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6325.326s">And</a> we talked about polling residents to see if there'd be some support out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6330.449s">We</a> talked about a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6333.13s">And</a> I agree with the firefighter that got up, Mr. Flynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6336.472s">He</a> mentioned that, you know, we made a commitment to go out and view all the fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6342.132s">Where</a> is that commitment? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6345.193s">It's</a> more talk, and that's why you can see how people say, you know what, all they're doing is, they're only hot air. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6352.274s">If</a> we were concerned about going to each fire station, we should have made that commitment, Mr. President, and followed through with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6359.955s">And</a> we haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6362.436s">We</a> heard Brian Cronin, he's presented information before this council about cancer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6369.077s">And</a> I know we had the Board of Health Director out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6371.848s">But</a> I'm not that confident that whatever was done by the Board of Health is going to make sure that the brave men and women of the fire department don't have to eat their dinner within five feet of an apparatus that they could be catching cancer off of, or sleeping in a facility that fumes go up to the second floor, or putting their turnout gear or regular gear next to trucks that are pulling in and out of a garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6400.843s">So</a> these are the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6402.465s">This</a> is not merely simply about building a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6406.369s">It's</a> about life or death. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6408.492s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6410.374s">And</a> I don't think we can turn a cheek when they present cancer rates and show the cancer rates in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6418.062s">We're</a> not looking at other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6419.184s">We're</a> looking at this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6421.059s">and</a> draw a direct correlation between our old, outdated stations and how they build new stations and keep the men and women safe in new stations now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6430.542s">And</a> that's why this council fought for dryers to clean the turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6435.043s">That's</a> why they fought for a second pair of turnout gear and washers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6441.065s">All</a> for safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6443.425s">These</a> aren't aesthetics. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6445.686s">Like</a> I said, they're not looking for a new kitchen with marble countertops. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6451.158s">They're</a> looking to be safe in a building that they're in seven days a week, 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6456.26s">I</a> don't think that's asking a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6457.881s">And</a> now's the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6460.462s">Again,</a> before we take the vote, I ask my colleagues, just take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6465.865s">Let's</a> continue our dialogue and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6468.606s">It</a> doesn't stop anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6471.107s">Yeah,</a> will the police station take a little longer? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6473.308s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6474.109s">But</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6475.389s">So's</a> the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6478.681s">And</a> we're not talking a little longer, we're talking years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6483.562s">So</a> I respectfully ask my colleagues, this is not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6486.483s">No</a> one behind this reel, the firefighters, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6488.723s">No</a> one behind this reel is against firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6491.864s">They</a> know that, the police know that, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6495.665s">There's</a> a mutual respect here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6497.645s">Let's</a> just take another step. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6499.605s">Let's</a> just take one more step. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6501.166s">Let's</a> look at this and let's continue to be at the table so we can have discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6507.487s">Because</a> once this issue is voted on, the discussions are going to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6511.55s">That's</a> no secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6513.611s">They</a> only started up because we requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6516.753s">The</a> Board of Health only went down there and did stuff because the council requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6520.796s">There's</a> only a new police station because we went and did the walk of shame, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6526.019s">We</a> were on the council at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6528.221s">We</a> did the walk of shame through the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6530.522s">There's</a> only a new DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6532.243s">We</a> did the walk of shame through the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6534.805s">It</a> showed the conditions of that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6537.817s">and</a> alerted the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6541.199s">This</a> building is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6544.4s">It's</a> no different, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6545.941s">I</a> respectfully ask one of my colleagues to reconsider their vote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6550.643s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6593.436s">Mr.</a> President, we do have someone who would like to speak briefly on an issue of timing that you may be serving.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6761.697s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6764.8s">Counsel</a> Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6765.9s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6767.101s">The</a> way the process, as far as I know, is outlined, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6769.824s">is</a> that once the Community Preservation Committee makes recommendations, it appears before the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6776.886s">So</a> I don't want anyone at home to believe that we're circumventing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6781.207s">I</a> do agree with setting up a Committee of the Whole, as you did, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6785.748s">However,</a> there are extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6788.809s">And</a> as my colleague, Councilor De La Russa, would know, there's been many times that my colleague has approved, when the administration comes up and say, we were just presented with this, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6798.556s">we</a> need a vote tonight, you know, and not able to move it to a subcommittee or committee of the whole, that that vote is taken because of extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6807.878s">And</a> this happens to be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6809.419s">This</a> issue, and I won't speak for the two women at the podium, but this issue has been presented not only to this council, but this community for several years now, actually, about refurbishing around the Roberts Elementary School playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6825.863s">And</a> it is in vital need. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6827.957s">And</a> I'd like to hear, because I'm under the impression that time is of the essence on this, and if it's a week delay, that could alter things, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6837.343s">And</a> I would be willing to support this tonight, Mr. President, as an extenuating circumstance.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7081.835s">Councilor</a> Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7090.279s">Councilor</a> Neill.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7159.388s">So,</a> Mr. President, would it be okay if we requested to vote on one portion of the paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7173.015s">So</a> I'd like a legal opinion on whether or not the 90-day rule would apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7178.341s">We're</a> only voting on one portion of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7181.786s">I</a> don't believe that would apply, Mr. President, to the five of the proposed items. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7187.693s">So</a> I'm not quite sure that does apply.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7196.231s">It's</a> presented as a whole paper, so this would have to be severed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7213.173s">I</a> appreciate what my colleagues say, and I appreciate the fact that we're meeting tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7243.779s">If</a> maybe the petitioner could tell us some more around how will this affect your deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7248.023s">I</a> know you mentioned there's a deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7249.584s">So</a> maybe if you could just clarify.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7270.06s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7270.641s">And</a> we listen to residents when they come up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7281.662s">Well,</a> I'd like to hear the sense of urgency. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7283.844s">I</a> know Cheryl did describe the sense of urgency. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7288.348s">I'd</a> like to hear a little more on that, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7382.503s">So</a> Mr. President, just so I understand, approving it tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7390.307s">or</a> waiting till tomorrow night, which may or may not be approved, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7395.61s">We</a> could leave it in Committee of the Whole, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7398.751s">We</a> could leave the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7399.592s">There's</a> nothing that's forcing us to vote tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7404.374s">I</a> just want to make sure that if we did report it out tonight, what's the earliest, Mr. Clerk, that this paper could be before the administration?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7418.821s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7420.43s">Well,</a> the allocation has to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7422.071s">It's</a> not made by us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7423.472s">So,</a> someone from the administration does the allocation and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7427.514s">I</a> would assume, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7428.174s">It's</a> not the CPC committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7429.795s">So,</a> it's got to be someone from the administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7439.68s">So,</a> I'm asking how long does that roughly take? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7442.261s">Are</a> we splitting hairs here?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7481.577s">It's</a> possible.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7816.048s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7817.229s">Uh,</a> I would support what council and I just brought up, uh, tomorrow we're meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7822.194s">I,</a> as one member of the council, we'll be pushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7824.696s">Uh,</a> there's a lot of items on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7826.679s">But</a> this will be one that I'll be pushing out of Committee of the Whole tomorrow, and I agree with his statement about if we're able to expedite this and let the administration know there's a sense of urgency, and if we can trim off a few days here and there, then we're splitting hairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7843.052s">So</a> if we're able to trim off a few days, whether we approve it tonight or tomorrow, I agree with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7847.995s">So</a> I would ask that this item go directly to the Committee of the Whole, and we'll relay our sense of urgency, as Councilor Knight mentioned.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8445.125s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8446.866s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8447.886s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8449.735s">This</a> is such a huge issue in the community and would impact a majority of the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8458.2s">And</a> to be quite honest with you, to bring it up under suspension, I don't think it's doing the whole transparency issue we hear about all the time any justice, because no one in the community is aware of us bringing this up now, other than the fact it was brought up under suspension.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8508.04s">It's</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8508.42s">No,</a> it's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8510.982s">I</a> appreciate you saying that because I think if we look at debt exclusion, there are a lot of needs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8518.307s">And</a> why should we limit it to just one issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8522.05s">How</a> many times do we hear about the roads in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8525.593s">And</a> we're clearly not going to make any headway with how we do business through the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8530.997s">So</a> we're going to have to get creative and get bold. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8534.113s">and</a> look at debt exclusion to repair our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8537.815s">Now,</a> that's only one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8539.615s">I</a> can go through a list of issues that probably need to be done and that we're not going to be able to do through the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8547.078s">This</a> is a very slippery slope, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8551.08s">You</a> know, we hear from multimillion-dollar businessmen that don't have a problem raising taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8557.603s">But</a> we have to remember that not everyone is a multimillion-dollar business owner in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8564.419s">And</a> that the slightest increase, not only in taxes, but something outside of taxes, like the — let's take, for instance, Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8574.044s">We</a> heard, oh, it's only $45 a year, $50. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8576.365s">Now</a> we're hearing debt exclusion, oh, it might be $65, $70, $80. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8580.127s">We</a> don't know, $45. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8582.368s">That</a> all adds up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8584.529s">And</a> in addition, everything else is going up — your cable bill, your electric bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8589.252s">Everything</a> else is going up, Mr. President, at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8591.653s">So</a> I think we have to be mindful <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8593.932s">when</a> we want to get bold with the people's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8596.933s">You</a> know, it's great to get bold with someone else's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8599.133s">That's,</a> you know, let's get, let's get, let's think outside the box and charge everyone more taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8605.314s">It's</a> not that creative to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8607.034s">That's</a> not, that's, that's not that creative to me, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8647.577s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8648.858s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8649.398s">And</a> it would go to the ballot, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8652.153s">If</a> we're unable to provide the city services, Mr. President, that we should be offering as a community to our regular tax base, then there's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8661.898s">There's</a> an inherent problem in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8665.86s">And</a> I would submit to you, with the building boom that's going on and the increased revenues that are going on in this community, we can't afford the things that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8674.544s">And</a> we have to prioritize. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8676.605s">And</a> that's not taking place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8679.127s">So,</a> to go outside of the budgetary constraints <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8681.924s">and</a> say we can raise money through CPA, we can raise money through, you know, we can raise money through debt exclusion, you know, we'll also privatize our electricity bill and try to save people money that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8696.497s">This</a> is all going to come home to roost. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8698.378s">Someone</a> has to pay for it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8700.7s">This</a> is all going to come home to roost. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8703.101s">And</a> I'm not at the point right now that I'm going to be operating outside of the city budget, which I believe people are already overtaxed in this community, get limited services, which I see on a daily basis, and then ask for additional. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8717.253s">Now</a> we're going to be asking to send out the tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8720.916s">Hey,</a> in addition to debt exclusion, in addition to CPA, we also want to know, would you like to donate a little more money to build this, this, and this? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8729.963s">I</a> mean, where are we going, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8732.345s">Where</a> do we go? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8732.985s">Why</a> don't we just put our hand in the pocket of each and every taxpayer? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8736.587s">We</a> won't need to ask them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8738.088s">And</a> that's the slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8740.349s">I</a> realize what we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8742.03s">But</a> ultimately, Mr. President, I come from a different train of thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8745.951s">That's</a> work within the confines of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8748.653s">We</a> happen to be in a great economy now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8750.954s">There</a> should be no reason that we're looking at debt exclusion to do the simple, simple task of maintaining our buildings and our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8760.272s">That</a> goes with a $160 million-odd budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8764.873s">And</a> if we can't operate within that budget, we need to take a look at some of the high-paying salaries around here and some of these no-show jobs, Mr. President, that are in the six-figure sums, Mr. President, if we want to get a handle on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8779.275s">Not</a> going back to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8781.436s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8783.036s">Mr.</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8961.583s">One</a> information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8963.824s">Right,</a> and that would allow the people to decide, but what if it's a 60-40 vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8968.667s">Do</a> you tell the 40 percent, sorry, you're going up anyways? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8973.45s">So,</a> it's not a clear cut just because it's <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8976.051s">Just</a> because it passes, just because it passes that everyone's on board, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8980.554s">There's</a> a lot of hardships out there, people struggling day to day that, you know, will have to make decisions whether or not they're going to eat or pay their taxes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8991.241s">Those</a> are life decisions that are being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8993.603s">We</a> may not experience it, but they're out there, believe me.<h2><a href="../2018-04-26_jATtLoh7en8/2018-04-26_jATtLoh7en8.html">Medford City Council 04/24/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1165.417s">Mr.</a> President, did we all get a copy of that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1176.625s">Was</a> it this week's package? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1178.345s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1196.99s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1496.769s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1498.19s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1499.291s">I</a> have no problem approving this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1501.132s">However,</a> the event at Circle the Square, it mentions various locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1507.216s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, would want to make sure that whatever is being done is not placed in front of an already existing food establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1517.063s">And</a> would ask that the paper be amended <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1523.023s">to</a> have the administration provide locations for this particular event, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1933.237s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1934.818s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1935.639s">I</a> do want to thank the Method Community Coalition and the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1939.362s">They</a> held a cleanup day this past Saturday in many of our business districts, and they did a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1946.128s">I</a> believe we all received an email regarding trash from one woman that her and her daughter were out, and she noticed a lot of cigarette butts. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1958.337s">So</a> I would say that, in addition to a trash barrel, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1961.6s">that</a> the city also look at putting cigarette receptacles where people can place a cigarette in, Mr. President, because you don't want them throwing them in a trash barrel that could cause a fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1973.147s">So</a> I would ask that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1975.668s">The</a> second thing is that I believe much of the debris we see around is because the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1983.053s">this</a> community only sweeps our streets twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1986.476s">It's</a> inadequate for the number of businesses that we have, the number of vehicular cars that are cut through this community, that may dump trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1994.222s">And</a> I believe that we have to impact and put together a full-fledged street sweeping program, which would sweep our streets more than twice a year, and also our neighborhoods, which much of this debris, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2012.404s">I</a> can tell you firsthand, living off the Fellsway, that every day, indeed, I'm out there picking up trash that blows up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2019.546s">And</a> you come out the next day, and it's more trash that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2023.107s">And</a> it ranges from Dunkin' Donuts to plastic bags to newspapers, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2028.009s">Some</a> of the stuff you see out there is pretty amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2031.81s">A</a> second thing, Mr. President, and I don't want to seem critical, but waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2037.598s">If</a> you happen to see when they dump the barrels, it's pretty amazing how much trash gets left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2047.988s">When</a> it picks up, the arm picks up, it dumps the thing in there, and then you see paper fly out here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2053.633s">And</a> it may not seem like a lot in front of your house, but times that by 30,000 households, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2058.551s">And</a> it's a fair number of trash that's somehow escaping from the truck and not getting in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2064.797s">Some</a> of it's due to barrels that are over strewn with trash, and the lids aren't closed properly, which was supposed to be a mandate in order to dump your trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2075.748s">The</a> lid had to be shut when the program first started. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2078.71s">Now</a> they seem to be very liberal in taking the trash, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2083.692s">That's</a> the second reason, I believe, you see additional trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2088.476s">So</a> it's the lack of street sweeping in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2091.438s">It's</a> also the waste management pickup, which I believe could be done more efficiently and effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2098.084s">And</a> the third point, Mr. President, and I had this discussion with the gentleman that called up regarding the trash along the sidewalks when he walks his pet. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2108.933s">The</a> dog's trying to eat stuff constantly that's <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2111.427s">left</a> outside on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2114.428s">And,</a> you know, we require by ordinance that people shovel in front of their home, even though it's a city sidewalk, that you take ownership and pride and you shovel in front of your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2125.492s">And</a> if you don't, you potentially could get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2128.353s">And</a> someday we may need to expand that to also sweeping in front of your home and taking care of the public sidewalk in front of your home when it comes to cleanliness, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2139.531s">I</a> don't think it's a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2140.711s">I</a> think it shows a sense of pride and a sense of ownership, you know, and a lot of people do it anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2147.353s">But,</a> you know, I think this would go a long way to putting our best foot forward as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2153.574s">When</a> people drive through, which many thousands of people do, they see a city that's clean and taken care of and not a city that's littered with debris, which I hate to say is currently happening right now in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2167.307s">Mr.</a> President, so those would be my suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2169.708s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2170.449s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2542.885s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2544.626s">I</a> believe we all received an email from a resident that was concerned about the living conditions of her parents living at Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2554.973s">I</a> happen to make a call and talk to the executive director, Mr. Driscoll, regarding some of the concerns that were mentioned, which was cleanliness of <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2565.476s">the</a> building and we did receive several photos which showed a building that was in dire need of a sweep and some 409 and some heavy duty cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2578.804s">It</a> was also mentioned that in this particular location <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2582.699s">There's</a> been a concern with bed bugs in several of the units within Walkland Court, of which I was assured by the executive director that the exterminator that's been called out has been doing the proper number of treatments to eradicate the bed bugs, which I believe has to take at least a two to three week span and at least three treatments. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2608.151s">And</a> also the fact that when residents are told that <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2612.537s">their</a> apartment will be exterminated, there should be a step-by-step process that they need to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2620.427s">in</a> order to eradicate the bed bugs, because if you take your sheeting and other items, clothing, and put it in storage, which may be in the basement of that facility while they're treating your apartment, and then after it's done, reintroduce all the stuff that was in the apartment, that may be the cause of reintroducing the bed bugs over and over, and also the spread of bed bugs within a particular housing unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2647.756s">So</a> I'm confident now that <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2650.618s">The</a> executive director, Mr. Driscoll, is on top of this, that the proper professionals were called out in order to take care of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2663.03s">There</a> is a cleaning crew that will be going through all the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2667.014s">Another</a> issue, Mr. President, was the dumpsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2670.517s">According</a> to this particular woman that contacted the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2675.625s">that</a> at any given time this furniture and a number of items that are left outside of this little alleyway, which is where they housed their dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2684.973s">And</a> the executive director assured me that he will have it monitored. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2690.968s">It's</a> not under lock and key. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2693.11s">In</a> my opinion, you probably have people dumping that don't live in the particular area and know there's a dumpster there and dumping items off. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2701.495s">And</a> depending on what the item is, it could be attracting rodents and infestation and other concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2707.98s">So</a> he assured me that they were going to keep a close eye on the dumpster and potentially look at some type of locking mechanism that's only available to residents, which to me makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2720.625s">The</a> last concern which I discussed with Mr. Driscoll was based on what this particular Method resident reached out and said that when residents bring concerns, they're fearful that their concerns may be used against them or they may be told, well, if you keep on bringing these things up, you know, you're going to have to find housing somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2743.399s">And</a> that's pretty devastating when you're talking <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2747.522s">elderly</a> and disabled people which occupy these 144 units, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2753.745s">And</a> I made it known to the executive director that any such action by any employee will not be tolerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2762.149s">And</a> he agreed with me and said that he was going to have a discussion with his staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2766.892s">So</a> there is proper protocol according to <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2769.943s">federal</a> and state statute out there for housing that would require when you file a grievance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2777.89s">So</a> if you're living in a state or federal building, there's a whole policy you can follow to file a grievance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2785.576s">And</a> it actually gets to the executive director level. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2788.619s">And</a> if you're not happy with the executive director, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2791.351s">Then</a> you can go to either federal or state court to resolve your issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2795.813s">So</a> there's a number of avenues, and by no means or at any time should anyone be a fear that there'll be retribution or something held against them for reporting an issue of concern, which may be cleanliness, rodents, whatever it might be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2813.14s">No</a> one should be in fear of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2814.721s">And</a> I let that be known to the executive director. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2817.568s">I'm</a> hoping some changes are going to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2819.949s">That</a> walk-in court is the only state development we have in this community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2825.852s">The</a> federal government back, I think it was two or three years ago, moved to purchase all the state housing within the Commonwealth, and I assume across the country, but I know in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2837.798s">And</a> for some reason, that walk-in court, they were not interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2842.441s">They</a> purchased some of the other state housing we had in the community, but not walk-in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2847.475s">And</a> according to the director, he said it's no excuse, but they are sorely underfunded by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2855.558s">And,</a> you know, he's paying special attention to this particular unit because of the lack of funding and the needs that are in that building, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2865.801s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2866.222s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2866.842s">Councilman</a> Locren.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3948.263s">As</a> I stated last week, Mr. President, during this discussion, that I am all in favor of correcting the error. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3954.687s">However,</a> I do agree with my council colleague that we found out about this error well over two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3960.411s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, you know, am very supportive of doing away with the use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3968.777s">You</a> know, so I'd rather pursue it in that avenue, and we will cover that by a vote of this council in doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3977.424s">You</a> know, either way, it doesn't matter to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3980.005s">It's</a> kind of semantics. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3981.626s">But,</a> you know, I hope we meet sooner than later regarding moving some of these important issues, Mr. President, with all this development going on, that we need to move some of these important issues to safeguard our residents.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=116.51s">Thank</a> you very much for being here tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=118.972s">You</a> know, my first question, Sean, is maybe if you can give us a little background. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=123.396s">People</a> know who a city council is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=126.139s">They</a> know who a school committee person is.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=222.947s">Well,</a> I think it's fair to say that you've been representing Medford in such a great manner for the past almost 10 years that we consider you part of Medford.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=245.933s">Well,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=246.713s">And</a> I think people appreciate the fact that you do a lot regarding constituent services. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=251.956s">And</a> it's important, as I know as a member of the city council, that when people call, you've got to get back in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=258.48s">And</a> I hear good things about what you're doing on behalf of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=262.202s">So</a> I want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=263.463s">I</a> just wanted to get into briefly, I know the house budget is up and before you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=268.726s">If</a> you can give us just a little feedback on the house budget and what, if any impacts there will be to the city of Medford.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=471.7s">As</a> you probably know, we've become so dependent on local aid as a community that when we set our budget, we rely on the money coming from the state in order to fund the things like you mentioned, education. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=483.749s">Our</a> education budget in the city is a third of our total budget, over a third of our total budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=488.333s">So</a> it's a big, important issue in the community, and it's helpful to know that you're on the Ways and Means Committee, which is an influential position, and that you're going to be fighting on behalf of our community to make sure we receive the appropriate funds.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=549.241s">Speaking</a> of education. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=550.242s">I</a> know you're the vice chair of the higher education house committee And I was wondering if you can give us a little brief background on what's currently happening before that committee and your role with that committee absolutely, so
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=681.536s">That's</a> great and you just hit home with me because I actually have three students right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=688.183s">I</a> have two at Framingham State College and one at UMass Lowell.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=694.849s">Proud</a> Riverhawk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=695.99s">Let</a> me tell you, all great schools <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=698.312s">And</a> it's great to hear that you're talking about putting some money into a program that could potentially help those who may not be able to afford to get into college and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=709.164s">And</a> keeping our population educated is key in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=713.95s">And</a> I'm glad to hear that there's a bill that you're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=717.373s">Where</a> does that bill currently stand?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=765.588s">And</a> I know you're working on a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=767.49s">Criminal</a> justice reform is also another issue I know that's been near and dear to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=772.395s">Can</a> you give us an update on how that's going?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=905.988s">Wow,</a> it seems like you have a full plate of issues.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=912.055s">Another</a> issue on the local level is, and I'm just throwing this out there, I've always had an issue with attracting people during election time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=921.945s">You</a> know, because people don't get out and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=925.007s">And</a> we find it on the local level, as you probably know, if you get 25 to 30 percent, you're extremely lucky in a local election. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=933.391s">And</a> it starts to build up. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=934.572s">A</a> state election, you get a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=935.893s">In</a> a presidential election, you get, you know, a larger percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=940.375s">any</a> thoughts on how we could, as a community, and I'm sure Arlington struggles with the same, how can we spur the interest of a community to get them out, let them know that local government is extremely important, we probably impact more that goes on in their life than the federal or the state government, and how do we get more people involved and interested in getting out and getting involved in the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1142.087s">I</a> actually like the idea.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1148.569s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1149.509s">And</a> to me, everything's on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1151.35s">So</a> any way we can promote elections, that being one, I think is a positive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1156.252s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1157.072s">You</a> know, again, I want to thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1159.475s">I</a> want to thank you for your effort on behalf of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1162.479s">I</a> know that when we have crucial issues that we can count on your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1166.384s">We</a> can count on your being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1169.187s">And</a> I think that goes a long way in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1171.871s">Again,</a> I want to thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1219.039s">Absolutely,</a> and I thank you again for your time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1224.653s">Hi,</a> and I'm back with my next guest, Craig Foley. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1227.876s">Craig</a> and I just spent several minutes discussing actually what he does, and I'm still confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1233.561s">So</a> Craig, if you can fill us in on exactly what do you do, Craig?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1303.558s">Very</a> interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1304.799s">So</a> one of the big issues in the community is how do we become more energy efficient? <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1309.463s">And</a> I know in the City of Medford we've taken some steps regarding solar energy, regarding wind power. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1316.247s">We</a> are in the process right now of putting LED lights in our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1321.23s">Are</a> there any suggestions that you can give, not only for a community, but a business owner or a local resident on how to become, ways of becoming more energy efficient?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1422.549s">What</a> else is part of the program? <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1423.73s">I</a> know you mentioned insulation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1507.744s">I</a> see Mass Save, they come out at a lot of local events promoting this, and you're right, if we were able to get it out in a way that people feel comfortable, a lot of people don't know about the program, what it entails, and especially if it's at no cost for just an analysis, I mean, that's a win-win.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1528.34s">So</a> the other issue I hear off and on is solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1531.682s">Living</a> in New England, do we have enough sun to make it feasible to have solar power and so forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1537.584s">What</a> are your thoughts of someone that may be going back and forth, whether they're going to go solar or not?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1695.748s">I</a> mean, those are real challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1697.009s">So</a> living in New England, does that put a damper on things because of
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1806.597s">It's</a> a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1807.917s">And</a> we have a minute left. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1810.159s">And</a> I hate to do this to you, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1811.48s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1812.24s">Another</a> big issue that recently came forward was municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1817.144s">If</a> you could just give us a one minute thought on municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1820.927s">I</a> know you were instrumental in Melrose in bringing their program to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1826.831s">Just</a> give us one minute that you think people should know about how this works for those that are out there.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1961.15s">Well,</a> that was a great answer, and I appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1964.433s">I</a> think I have a somewhat of a better understanding of exactly what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1969.196s">And</a> again, Craig, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1970.778s">And</a> maybe we'll have you back on the show someday when things start to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1975.141s">Thanks,</a> Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1975.801s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1980.177s">I</a> want to thank my guest tonight, State Rep Sean Garbali. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1983.501s">If</a> anyone's interested in reaching out to the state representative, he is more than happy to discuss any issue you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1990.288s">I</a> thought it was very interesting to hear what is going on with the state legislature and how it impacts our city as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=1997.416s">My</a> second guest, I want to thank Craig Foley. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=2000.34s">Craig</a> Foley is an advocate for sustainability, and I also found that very interesting and informative on ways we as a community can become more environmentally friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B8gjC1urdA8&t=2011.153s">So</a> thanks again for tuning in on Spotlight on Method.<h2><a href="../2018-04-02_3aOalIsRmxU/2018-04-02_3aOalIsRmxU.html">Spotlight on Medford - Ep2</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=2.174s">Hello</a> and welcome to another edition of Spotlight on Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=5.58s">I'm</a> your host, Michael Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=7.283s">I'm</a> standing here at Channel 3 Community Access located at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=11.83s">Anyone</a> interested in producing their own show, come on down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=15.863s">You</a> know, I have two great guests on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=18.384s">I</a> have Gary Roberts from the Medford Arts Council, he's the chair, and Jim Silva, who's a community activist and also the founder of SMADO, South Medford Residents Together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=29.23s">You</a> know, we got together a while back and created a small working group of citizens interested in forming an arts collaborative in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=38.454s">a</a> committee to explore the creation of an arts center in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=41.937s">The</a> committee includes leadership of some of Medford's largest art organizations, including Caché, the Medford Arts Council, and Medford Arts Center and Corp., better known as MACI. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=53.367s">Among</a> the locations being reviewed is the building formerly known as the Hegner Center, located at 15 Maple Park Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=60.653s">next</a> to Gillis Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=62.174s">which</a> was reacquired by the city of Medford back in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=67.062s">So</a> sit back, grab your popcorn, and enjoy the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=128.453s">Hi,</a> and I'm very excited to have my two guests on tonight who are representing the Arts Collaborative Method, which is a new collaboration of a group of concerned citizens who are interested in the arts in the community and that would like to see an arts center come to fruition in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=146.862s">My</a> two guests, one is Gary Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=149.283s">He</a> is the chair of the Method Arts Council and has been so for the past five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=154.325s">And</a> I also have Jim Silva here, who is a community organizer and someone that's been very active in the South Medford neighborhood with the creation of SMARTO, which is South Medford Residents Together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=167.595s">So</a> I'd like to thank both my guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=170.416s">Mr.</a> Silva.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=172.097s">Mr.</a> Roberts, let's start off with just telling us a little about your involvement in the arts community and anything else you'd like to share with us regarding your community involvement.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=247.279s">That's</a> hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=247.699s">Seems</a> like you're very active and involved in the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=251.46s">That's</a> great to hear.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=282.095s">That's</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=282.815s">That's</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=283.455s">And</a> Jim, tell us a little about what you've been doing in the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=340.722s">I</a> know firsthand being involved in some of those initiatives that you have been very successful with SMARTO in bringing and confronting some of the issues that face your particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=351.907s">And</a> to be quite frank, I'd like to see that done citywide because I think it's been a great initiative and very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=358.71s">in</a> getting some needs within the community addressed that sometimes otherwise would be overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=366.036s">So</a> I appreciate your effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=367.077s">I</a> know also, we won't get into it a lot, the Green Line Extension has been, you're on the committee now, and maybe if you could just give a minute or two about where we stand with the Green Line Extension.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=378.446s">I'm</a> on the working group.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=410.905s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=411.325s">We</a> all know transportation is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=413.547s">It's</a> the reason why people move to communities and I'm thankful for your effort on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=419.152s">I</a> know it's all volunteer, both volunteer positions and on behalf of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=425.317s">I</a> want to thank you because I know a lot of time and effort goes into it, and it's all behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=430.742s">It's</a> not like being a member of the council when you have FaceTime all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=434.105s">People</a> say, oh, look what he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=435.927s">These</a> are volunteers that are behind the scenes, actually the backbone of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=440.091s">So</a> I want to thank you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=441.632s">Let's</a> talk a little bit about the, which I mentioned at the beginning, this new arts collaborative method, which I believe was initiated for the fact that we're looking to create an arts center, a home for the arts in the community, which I believe, and I know you both do, is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=459.675s">So</a> maybe if you can both give me a quick rundown of how was this created, why was it created, the who, what, when, where, why of where we're at now with <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=470.677s">the</a> creation of an art center in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=472.999s">Maybe</a> we could start off.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=549.709s">That's</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=550.868s">And</a> maybe if you could just outline what the need is in the community for an arts center, why would a community seek out space for arts, and how does arts impact the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=649.832s">So,</a> Jim, if you could just tell us a little bit of how you got involved and what you envision in an art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=658.915s">What</a> do you think an art center would be like?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=696.065s">So</a> the general idea is for arts, but it's also a place where you can meet neighbors, make friends, and do a lot of things, not just the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=707.049s">So</a> it's really a collaboration of not just arts, but drawing a community together.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=733.649s">So</a> I don't want to date myself, but back some years ago, when the issue came up, when there were a number of artists that were looking for space in the community, at that time, they said, let's look for an art center in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=746.933s">And</a> at the time, we were moving from our old neighborhood schools to the centralized schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=752.575s">And</a> one of the buildings that were no longer being used as a school, the Swan School, was targeted as an art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=760.978s">And</a> there was a collaboration back at the time between some of the art groups and also local community access. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=768.141s">That</a> happened to fall down and never came to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=772.163s">But</a> I think what's happening now is there's a renewed interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=777.485s">And</a> from what I heard, that there were several sites in the community that have been looked at where we can have not only administrative offices, which I'm sure, Gary, you would appreciate, having a place to hang your hat and call the Method Arts Council, but also a place that could have workshops and trainings and performances and art exhibits. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=800.952s">And</a> I know one site that really piqued the interest of this new arts collaborative method was the Hegna Center, which is right next to Gillis Park, if anyone's familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=814.96s">And</a> that, for many years, was not in city control. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=819.663s">The</a> city deeded out the building some time back for a purpose of helping people with <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=826.887s">developmentally</a> disabled people in the community and outside the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=832.571s">And</a> it was just recently within the last two years that the city retained the building back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=839.156s">And</a> I think it was a great opportunity on its location, its parking availability, and overall space <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=848.302s">that</a> I believe would make a great, great area for an art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=853.584s">And</a> I know we've done a tour of the building, and I would like to hear what you perceive we can do with the building and how we can include that building as a piece of the neighborhood.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=957.575s">Has</a> there been any formal outreach by any of the groups regarding surveys or information or feedback from the community in regards to what the community would like to see if we did implement an art center?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1101.518s">And</a> just to get to the point where there may be people that say, you know what, that's great to have an art center, but I'm homebound and I can't get out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1110.541s">Are</a> there any ideas that you know of that do community outreach and bring the arts out to the community, maybe in local parks or somewhere that may be more reachable to people that may not be able to get to a site?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1277.261s">I</a> mean, I've even noticed on the electrical boxes throughout the community, art displays in the electrical boxes, which I think adds so much to a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1285.026s">I</a> know back last year and the year before, Mackie was doing what they call art bombs, which they put yarn around electrical lights and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1295.274s">And</a> just the addition, it makes it look like, you know, someone's there, someone cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1301.979s">And</a> I know I had the chance to go to Lowell <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1305.882s">back</a> a few years back, and I think it's something that you talked about, Gary, about how they took a park that was in a drug-infested area and built a small performance stage and really took back the park from <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1321.308s">which</a> was considered a downtrodden park and residents didn't want to use it, they were fearful, and created with wrought iron and a small wooden stage at a minimal cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1332.939s">And</a> I said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1334.821s">We</a> don't have those type of parks, thank God, that are drug infested, but it would be nice to use some of the open space we have to invite people right in the neighborhood <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1344.89s">to</a> get involved with the yachts, and at a minimal cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1348.473s">And</a> I really would like to see that concept someday implemented, and I know you probably both would like to see the same.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1450.703s">So</a> the next question naturally would be, we have a need for an art center in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1457.689s">We</a> have several locations that we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1460.451s">And</a> I guess the big question is, how would we fund an art center? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1464.394s">What's</a> the next steps? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1466.476s">Do</a> we go through studies, feasibility studies? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1470.159s">Jim,</a> I know you're an organizer in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1472.781s">I</a> know that you were one of the members on the creation of the dog park behind the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1477.725s">McGlynn</a> School on River Bend, and you were one of the people that led the drive to go out and find private funding through the Stanton Foundation that paid for a good majority, if not all, of the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1492.653s">And</a> what do you see your experience in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1497.596s">and</a> going forward with the art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1499.178s">How</a> are we going to move this forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1500.919s">Naturally,</a> funds are tight in the community, and there's a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1504.623s">We</a> have a lot of projects, as you're probably both aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1508.086s">So</a> how do we make this happen, and what are the next steps?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1677.606s">You</a> know, I can't say enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1679.427s">I</a> want to thank you both for your involvement in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1683.69s">And</a> really, I think this is a worthy initiative and I appreciate your volunteerism in moving this community forward that we all love and care for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1694.179s">And</a> I think this is going to be a great asset when it does come to reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1699.263s">And</a> again, I want to thank you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1700.544s">Thank</a> you for putting it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1702.626s">Thank</a> you for all your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1703.767s">Thanks</a> for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1706.64s">Medford</a> has a large and dynamic arts community, with numerous individual artists and more than 25 arts and culture organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1715.424s">The</a> Medford Arts Council funds more than 60 cultural programs throughout the city each year, and Caché's online arts and culture calendar featured over 600 events in Medford in 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1728.931s">And</a> yet, the arts currently have no physical home in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1732.613s">There</a> is also a lack of space in the city for holding arts-related events and displaying the work of our artists, and organizations rely on temporary and borrowed spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1743.542s">An</a> arts center could serve as a hub for the arts and method, and provide much-needed space for art classes, art exhibits, performances, art studios, and administrative space for art organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1758.113s">Arts</a> and culture are important to building a strong community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1761.074s">Not</a> only do the arts contribute to the attractiveness and livability of a city, they contribute directly to the strength of the local economy by supporting both our artists and our local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1772.197s">In</a> addition, arts education enhances student performances across all disciplines. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1777.738s">helping</a> to build motor skills, language, problem solving, and critical thinking skills in students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1783.98s">For</a> more information, please visit www.acmethod.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1789.661s">I</a> want to thank my two guests tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1792.162s">I</a> want to thank Gary Roberts, the Chair of Method Arts Council, and I want to thank Jim Silva, who is a local organizer, and also the creator of SMARTO, South Method Residents Together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1804.285s">I</a> want to thank them for all their civic-minded involvement in the community, and I want to thank you, the viewing audience, for tuning in once again for Spotlight on Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aOalIsRmxU&t=1815.099s">I</a> thank you for your viewership, and we'll see you next show on Spotlight Method.<h2><a href="../2018-03-16_zICWMPe0WJI/2018-03-16_zICWMPe0WJI.html">Spotlight On Medford - Ep 1</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=2.647s">Hello,</a> and welcome to the first edition of Spotlight on Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=6.25s">I'm</a> your host, Michael Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=8.311s">I'm</a> standing here today at the new community access station with brand new equipment, state-of-the-art equipment, all in this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=17.318s">I</a> invite anyone that wants to come up in the community to host their own show and get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=22.622s">After</a> all, this is your money that's paying for this community access. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=26.624s">Spotlight</a> on Method will host and highlight <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=30.507s">all</a> people living in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=32.189s">This</a> show is all about the city of Medford and the unique people and the many different talents that we have living in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=40.096s">I</a> plan on highlighting civic organizations, businesses, and residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=46.502s">As</a> a member of the city council for the past 16 years, you all know me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=50.486s">I've</a> been very active and involved in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=52.808s">I</a> also served for six years on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=55.751s">very</a> active in the schools at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=58.152s">There</a> are a lot of pressing issues that are confronting Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=61.032s">I</a> want to bring them to your attention, and hopefully this will be informative and interesting at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=66.733s">I</a> plan on having a great show. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=68.674s">Our</a> first guest is Fred Lasky, a local Method resident, and also he's the head executive director of the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=77.695s">Sit</a> back and relax and enjoy the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=142.844s">Hello</a> and welcome back to the first episode of Spotlight on Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=146.667s">I'm</a> here today with my very first guest, Fred Lasky. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=150.491s">Fred</a> Lasky is not only the Executive Director of the MWRA, but also a Method resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=156.036s">Fred</a> also served in several capacities on a statewide level. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=160.28s">He</a> was the Secretariat of the Administration and Finance, and also served in the Department of Revenue as the Director of the Department of Revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=169.248s">On</a> the local level, Fred served on the school committee two years, two terms, excuse me Fred, two terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=175.958s">And</a> he's also very active with the guiding club and also the local Boy Scouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=181.587s">Fred,</a> it's a pleasure to have you here today.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=184.154s">Thanks</a> very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=185.895s">Fred,</a> as the executive director of the MWRA, I'm sure you get a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=191.417s">And</a> I'm sure you're very involved with the day-to-day operations of the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=196.819s">But</a> I found some interesting service figures that I think it's important to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=202.161s">Most</a> of us get up for work and decide what we're going to have for breakfast and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=206.343s">But</a> when you get up in the morning, you have to make sure that 2.5 million people <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=212.905s">get</a> water and sewer every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=215.346s">You</a> service over 890,000 households, 5,500 businesses, and supply an average of 200 million gallons of water per day, and you treat over 350 million gallons of sewage per day for 61 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=232.898s">How</a> does that feel, Fred?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=442.058s">I</a> think under your leadership over the last many years that I myself have noticed a big difference in the quality of water that we get to our house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=450.983s">One</a> interesting fact that I remember reading somewhere online was that it takes roughly, it costs roughly one cent to get a gallon of clean drinking water to your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=461.669s">And</a> I found that very interesting fact.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=470.233s">It's</a> amazing, really.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=503.77s">For</a> the same type of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=505.871s">You</a> know, Fred, the number one question I get as a member of the council is, naturally, how can we lower rates? <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=512.616s">How</a> can I lower my MWRA water and sewer rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=516.619s">And</a> I tell people water conservation <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=520.755s">is</a> a great way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=521.515s">The</a> less you use, the less you're going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=524.096s">But</a> is there any other things that you can bring us up to date and tell the viewing audience, ways that they can actually try to lower their water and sewer rates?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=632.539s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=632.919s">And</a> how can someone get the dye tabs or the aerators?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=645.284s">From</a> a city standpoint, I know the city has taken action over the last several years, taking advantage of 0% finance loans that are offered by the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=656.187s">And</a> we've tackled many projects such as I&I inflow and infiltration, trying to get a handle on where the leakage is within our outdated sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=668.63s">and</a> also leak detection. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=671.052s">We</a> recently purchased a leak detection system that sends out an acoustic signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=676.796s">They're</a> located on the mains throughout the community and it sends out a signal and is able to tell the city within a matter of two to three feet where there may be a leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=687.403s">And</a> these are some of the things that we've taken steps as a community to try to get a handle on lowering costs from the MWRA <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=697.17s">Is</a> there anything else regarding the loans that you can think of?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=777.691s">So</a> there's been a lot of talk in the news recently, not right in this community, but in this state and across the country regarding lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=787.196s">And</a> what I try to tell people is that the MWRA has what I refer to as like a lead-free zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=794.279s">There</a> is no lead pipes currently that carries the water from the MWRA source. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=800.222s">to</a> homes, the 61 communities that you service. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=803.624s">However,</a> the lead that may be there is the connection between the city pipes and a homeowner's pipe, or the homeowner may have a lead connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=812.709s">Is</a> there anything that's being done now to help assist homeowners with possibly the changeover of their lead connections?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=911.328s">That's</a> a good suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=913.989s">I</a> believe on the city website there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=918.81s">thing</a> you can click on that will show that you can where you can get one of these kits from the lead testing kit yes and I believe the city will mail it out to you and I believe as part of the process the city then in return mails it to the MWRA and you guys do the testing is that correct yes and we've done you can hire a private lab if you'd like but we do those tests and we've done I think 38,000 tests on schools alone in our service area a lot of older schools and whatever and and and
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=961.057s">Protecting</a> our water supply is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=964.138s">Fred,</a> bringing it to a local level, Spot Pond, the Mystic River, are there any new things that are happening that residents may want to be aware of or any innovations that are going on currently within our community that you can speak of?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1102.09s">Well,</a> not to get from the MWRA, but on a local level, I know you're involved in many community initiatives and activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1110.252s">I</a> was wondering if you could just speak briefly about the Garden Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1114.153s">I</a> know you've been very involved and near and dear to you regarding the Garden Club.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1203.377s">I'm</a> so happy to see that it's expanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1206.199s">I</a> know the original setup that we had at the McGlynn School, there was roughly a two to three year waiting list, which showed there was interest in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1214.366s">And</a> now we're seeing it branch off into many of our 26 parks and open spaces throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1220.331s">So</a> I just see this as a win-win for the entire community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1229.175s">If</a> you could just, I know another aspect that you've been involved with is the Boy Scouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1234.879s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1235.42s">And</a> I think it's Troop 416 in particular.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1317.483s">You</a> know what, Fred, I want to thank you for your community involvement and your involvement for many, many years on the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1323.806s">And</a> in my opinion, you've taken the MWRA to another level. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1327.527s">And</a> I appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1329.228s">And</a> thanks for being a guest on the show.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1339.072s">Well,</a> thanks again. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1339.772s">And</a> I hope to see you soon.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1349.008s">And</a> we're back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1350.17s">I'm</a> sitting here tonight with my good friend, Bill O'Keefe, a lifelong Method resident, Vice President of Corporate Securities at Bank of America, and just an all-around good guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1361.406s">Bill,</a> thanks for coming on the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1363.449s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1363.77s">Thanks</a> for having me, Mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1364.551s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1364.751s">Appreciate</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1365.849s">Bill,</a> you've been very active, involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1368.77s">I</a> know you're the president of Method Little League. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1371.871s">And</a> I was just wondering if you can provide us with any updates on Method Little League.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1422.028s">Recently,</a> Bill, I'm sure you're aware that Method just created a new recreation department and they just recently hired a head of the recreation department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1431.259s">How</a> is that department going to be instrumental in combining all the efforts of all the youth sports and what do you foresee that recreation department to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1440.809s">like</a> in the coming future?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1515.063s">That's</a> long overdue and something needed in the community, somewhere that would act as a clearinghouse
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1570.487s">That's</a> great to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1572.388s">You</a> know, I played in my day for the West Medford Little League. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1577.492s">I</a> was on Gaffey's and Kiwanis, and was it a household name? <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1584.917s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1585.177s">Needless</a> to say, but I had a lot of fun playing Little League in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1589.28s">And</a> did you have any time playing?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1666.603s">There's</a> a lot of moving parts when it comes to scheduling.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1764.258s">Thanks,</a> Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1765.139s">You</a> know, we do have a lot of great organizations, in particular veterans organizations in this community, and I want to thank you for your commitment to the organizations and keeping this going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1777.187s">I</a> appreciate your time tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1778.808s">It's</a> been a pleasure seeing you, Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1781.31s">I'm</a> sure we'll see you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1783.091s">And</a> I'd just like to thank you for tuning in to the very first show on Spotlight Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1790.075s">I'd</a> like to thank my two guests tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1791.856s">We</a> had Fred Lasky, the executive director of the MWRA, who is a Method resident, and Bill O'Keefe, a lifelong Method resident, very active and involved in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1802.683s">I'd</a> like to thank Community Access Channel 3, Public Access. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1806.805s">Come</a> on down to Access Channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1808.706s">It's</a> open to anyone that wants to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1810.787s">You</a> have an open mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1811.948s">You</a> pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1813.17s">Like</a> I say, use the community access. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1816.153s">I</a> want to thank everyone for watching Spotlight on Method, and I'd like to give a special thanks to my producer, Chris Donovan, who has done yeoman's work in helping put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/zICWMPe0WJI&t=1827.865s">Again,</a> we'll see you next time on Spotlight Method.<h2><a href="../2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM/2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM.html">Medford City Council 02/27/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=70.064s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=71.005s">It</a> was roughly, I think, five or six months ago that this City Council unanimously put forward a motion <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=78.523s">to</a> request that the broadcasting equipment here at City Hall be updated because of the age of the equipment and the fact that the broadcast itself <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=91.122s">wasn't</a> going out properly to residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=94.445s">Shortly</a> after that, Ben Brown, who is the Method Community Media Station Manager, reached out to us in November 30th, and this is his email, Mr. President, to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=108.637s">I'd</a> like to just read part of it, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=112.08s">It's</a> addressed to the council, and it's regarding the Alden Chambers video upgrade, meeting rooms, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=119.706s">and</a> video install. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=121.527s">It</a> says, hello, I've received a detailed quote to first upgrade the cameras and broadcast equipment in the Alden Chambers, as well as to install cameras in two meeting rooms in City Hall for the web streaming of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=135.434s">In</a> the first portion of the proposal, the quote details installation of four new cameras, as well as the installation of all new TV equipment in the control room. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=144.759s">There</a> are a few reasons why this would need to be such a large upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=149.122s">But</a> the primary one is that the existing equipment at the Alden Chambers is so far behind that new equipment can't interface with the old. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=158.869s">So</a> Ben did his homework and came up with a cost to upgrade our broadcast equipment of a cost at $39,707. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=165.974s">He</a> then went to <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=172.138s">go</a> on to alert us about the web streaming that this council has met on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=178.6s">I</a> know Councilor Falco has discussed this on many occasions, to install cameras not only here in the council for transparency, but also in the other rooms in the building where we might have board and commission meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=193.183s">And</a> we had several meetings on this and discussed it and was part of the recommendation when the council voted on it to request that Ben also look into the cost to add these particular cameras in the rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=207.82s">So</a> on that part, he says for the meeting rooms we would be installing a single camera mounted in the corner of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=214.153s">as</a> well as two removable microphones that would sit on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=218.036s">These</a> would interface directly with the Acela streaming equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=222.36s">The</a> cost for web streaming is $7,058. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=226.864s">So</a> if you combine the broadcast equipment, which is our equipment here for government channel of 39,707 and 7,058, you come out with $46,765 to accomplish this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=244.311s">He</a> also goes on to say, for future consideration, the Alden Chambers system could incrementally be upgraded going forward to prevent such a large upgrade in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=254.496s">The</a> standards that are quoted should be around for another 15 to 20 years, which would allow for things to be swapped out rather than rebuilding from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=265.08s">I</a> thought that was very helpful to receive that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=267.975s">You</a> know, we've been talking about transparency, this council, for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=274.358s">And</a> I find it ironic now what's going on in this community and the lack of transparency that's taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=282.702s">And</a> here we are as a council, been asking just if we can upgrade our equipment so people that are unable to come to these meetings can view the meetings and see what's going on in city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=294.587s">You</a> know, we had for approximately three and a half to four years no cable access when it comes to government channel, I shouldn't say government channel, community access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=306.694s">And</a> yet, the rate payers were paying a franchise fee each and every month to operate not only the government channel, the school channel, and the community access channel, but we only got a portion of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=321.708s">So</a> there was surplus money left in the account, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and all we're asking for is a small amount to make sure people can view what's going on in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=334.035s">We</a> all talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=336.897s">The</a> second part of it, after that November correspondence we received from Ben Brown, the station manager, Councilor Longo responded back to the email and said that she received a number of complaints <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=352.245s">and</a> that people can't hear the meetings and see the meetings and etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=359.426s">Shahb</a> Khan, who's our Chief Procurement Officer, came back and said, I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=364.487s">This</a> vendor is on a state contract for video equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=367.728s">We</a> must need to find the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=370.328s">Without</a> this equipment, the software we bought for the streaming of meetings will not be of any use. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=375.349s">So</a> apparently we have the software for streaming the meetings in these other rooms, but we don't have the equipment to stream it with. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=383.89s">So</a> that was the Chief Procurement Officer stating that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=387.493s">And</a> then recently, we got a final email from Ben Brown, the station manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=396.682s">This</a> is dated February 21st, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=399.724s">And</a> it's to Jen Dever, Ed Finn, Lauren Felch, the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=407.792s">It</a> says, good morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=409.073s">I've</a> received extensive complaints about the quality of city council broadcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=413.694s">And</a> these quality issues are directly related to the age of the equipment that's in the room broadcasting the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=420.041s">I'd</a> really like to move forward with the installation of new equipment to settle this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=424.906s">Is</a> there anything we can do to move forward with this purchase order? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=428.75s">So</a> here we not only have the council, we not only have residents that are contacting the station manager, contacting the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=436.219s">I'm</a> sure contacting the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=438.72s">And</a> yet some four or five months later, we still are in the same position that we were five months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=445.503s">There's</a> money there in the cable account to attend to this very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=451.786s">And</a> I would ask Mr. President, we took a vote already as a council, sent it off to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=457.048s">And</a> I would ask again that we reinforce that vote and ask that the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=462.028s">allocate</a> $46,765 to renew the broadcast equipment here at City Hall and to also purchase the web streaming equipment that's needed to not only view boards and commissions when they have their meeting, but also Committee of the Whole meetings and other pertinent meetings that are taking place here at City Hall that residents really should know what's going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=489.432s">It's</a> a small amount to pay for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=492.254s">You</a> know, I think that word's overused nowadays, but let me tell you, Mr. President, it's true that the lack of transparency in this community is astonishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=503.7s">And</a> this is only one aspect that we've been asking for for years to make sure that people can view these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=511.518s">And</a> you see what happens when people aren't forthcoming with information and a lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=517.5s">You</a> see what happens in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=520.302s">So</a> I would ask that that be done in a roll call vote to the city administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=537.962s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=538.502s">She's</a> been looking into it for at least six months now and four years prior.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=989.119s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I bring this issue up tonight, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=994.987s">Because</a> it's an issue that's been near and dear to me for several years now, and one in which I've discussed during budget times with the superintendent of schools, one in which I have debated the superintendent on, and one in which I believe firmly that in order for us to have a secure school <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1019.847s">facility,</a> we must revisit our facility rental agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1026.249s">And</a> I bring this up, Mr. President, because recently I took it one step further and took a look at the current Medford Public Schools facility rental agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1037.671s">And</a> I went through it with a fine-tooth comb. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1040.417s">And</a> I was surprised to see a number of things, of which I am going to speak about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1049.863s">I</a> think when we look at a rental agreement, although it's stated in the policy that it should be used for community services and so forth, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1058.744s">It's</a> a valuable asset, which I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1061.505s">It</a> also states in here that it should generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1065.346s">And</a> to me, revenue is a side effect of us as a community and what we do with our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1074.508s">And</a> to me, the security of our faculty and our students should be the number one priority over revenue, over anything that's happening in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1084.104s">And</a> under this current facilities rental agreement, I don't believe it addresses security at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1091.87s">And</a> it doesn't mention at all the security of our buildings, the security of our students, or our faculty that are in these buildings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1101.057s">If</a> you would indulge me, I'd like to read certain sections of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1104.559s">And</a> the reason why I'm doing it is, I know, I believe it was last week, the school committee voted to take a look at their policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1113.088s">on</a> rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1114.509s">And</a> I don't want to say I told you so, but for the past five years I've actually voted against city budgets because of this very issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1123.421s">The</a> past five years I've had a dialogue and discussion with the superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1127.806s">And</a> he assured me over and over again, my colleagues were present for a lot of this, that he would indeed look into this and see if there was a shortcoming within our rental agreements and how we can improve it so that our students are safe within our buildings, that our faculty are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1145.014s">And</a> I'm very disappointed that in my discussions recently with the superintendent, that none of this was addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1153.303s">And</a> this is only one part of school safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1156.224s">I</a> don't want anyone to think that if we iron this out with rentals, that now we have a safe school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1162.386s">There's</a> policies, there's procedures, there's lockdowns, there's oversight, there's a lot else that takes place within our buildings to provide security. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1172.77s">And</a> this is one component, but a very important component. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1177.832s">So</a> the first page of <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1180.68s">the</a> facilities rental agreement, and by the way, this is, anyone can go on the city public school website and pull up this agreement, the Connor box just put in at the top, rental agreement, it'll pop up this particular agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1196.413s">One</a> information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1204.74s">Sure,</a> mine has personal comments on it, so I'm not gonna share mine, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1209.274s">If</a> you could email me the link, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1211.695s">We</a> can get this on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1214.096s">So</a> at first it states, Mr. President, procedure for use of school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1217.697s">It</a> says rental applications should contact community schools for facilities and the pool coordinator for the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1226.859s">Or</a> in the case of other facilities, the secretary of the school at which the facility is located to determine if the facility is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1235.654s">Once</a> an individual organization has determined facility availability, and has decided to proceed with the rental, the rental procedure at Medford Public Schools should be followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1247.043s">And</a> the very first thing says, you should go and complete the facility's usage request. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1254.248s">And</a> you can go right online, I printed it out, it's a two page request form. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1258.792s">The</a> request form asks for a name of applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1262.422s">That's</a> a pretty fair question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1264.883s">Name</a> of organization, your mailing address, your phone number, your email address, the city in which you reside. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1273.945s">And</a> the date requested, days of the week, the entrance time of the facility, and the exit time of the facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1282.048s">The</a> start of the activity, end of activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1284.888s">And</a> then you just have to sign it, leave a deposit. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1287.129s">I</a> believe it's a 25% deposit on whatever the cost is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1291.731s">And</a> then at midway down on the page, apparently the Medford Public Schools is open for rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1300.255s">It</a> says organizations using school facilities must adhere to the time approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1306.781s">And</a> then it goes on to say the school requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1311.005s">So</a> under this application, you can request to rent Medford High School, McGlynn Middle School, Andrews Middle School, the Brooks Elementary School, the Columbus Elementary School, and the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1325.082s">Then</a> it asks you, within those particular schools, what facility would you like to have within those particular schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1332.193s">You</a> can have the Marsha Karen Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1334.216s">You</a> can have Lecture Hall C2. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1336.219s">You</a> can have the McGlynn Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1337.842s">You</a> can have MHS Foyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1339.774s">You</a> can have Lecture Hall C3. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1341.895s">You</a> can have classrooms, Library Media Center, Brooks Elementary Gym, Columbus Elementary Gym, McGlynn Gym, Andrews Gym, Roberts Gym, Medford High Gym, Andrews Middle School Cafeteria, Batting Cages, Pool, MHS Cafeteria, Lecture Halls, Batting Cages, Edgeley Field, La Conte Rink, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1366.568s">In</a> other, you can put in other. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1368.931s">Maybe</a> you can write, I'd like to rent the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1372.316s">I</a> don't know, it says other. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1373.598s">Maybe</a> that's, so you can request whatever you want to rent in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1379.806s">The</a> next section is equipment services needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1382.309s">Do</a> you need a custodian? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1384.912s">you</a> check it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1386.233s">Food</a> service, you would check it off if you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1388.974s">A</a> house manager, you would check it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1391.275s">Theater</a> technician, a microphone, overhead projector, video, LCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1397.478s">Not</a> one question about security. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1401.539s">Not</a> one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1403.74s">And</a> in my opinion, it shouldn't be a question, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1407.888s">It</a> should be mandatory that if you're renting out public schools, that Medford Public Schools provides the security on behalf of our community to safeguard our building that we have millions of dollars invested in, and also on behalf of students and faculty that have to attend these buildings the day after we have people from outside the community using our facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1432.414s">It</a> only makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1434.553s">It</a> also should be a requirement to have a supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1438.776s">And</a> as I go on to the next page of this, it should be mandatory that the Medford Public Schools says not only will you be required to have security, but you also will be required to have a supervisor that'll be supervising the event that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1454.248s">Making</a> sure that you adhere to the rules and the standards and the building codes and the capacity requirements that a community has. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1463.975s">None</a> of that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1465.716s">So</a> there's the first shortfall within renting our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1469.538s">No</a> security requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1471.74s">It</a> should be mandatory, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1477.677s">The</a> next part of this, it also states, and this is back to the procedure for use of the school facilities, says the building principal and where applicable, the fine arts media director or designee, athletic director for fields and gyms, food service director will review and sign the application for the rental of the facility for the purpose stated and then forward it to the superintendent for final approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1504.383s">Not</a> one sign off <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1507.647s">by</a> security, not one sign off. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1510.969s">How</a> do you not include security in this day and age? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1514.892s">How</a> do you not safeguard our buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1517.934s">How</a> do you not mention that? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1519.976s">How</a> is that not a requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1521.757s">When</a> I go to the principal, the principal says, yeah, it's available on the 30th, that Friday, you can use the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1528.502s">And</a> he signs off. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1530.924s">The</a> next step should be, it goes to security. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1534.782s">whether</a> it's Chief Sackle or the head of security at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1538.263s">And</a> they should sign off and see what the number of people are required, what they're doing in the event, what does the event call for? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1545.826s">Does</a> it need more than one security personnel? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1548.287s">Does</a> it need more than one supervisors? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1551.508s">Another</a> omission in this particular rental agreement, Mr. President, a very alarming omission. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1561.151s">The</a> conditions of use. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1563.802s">All</a> users shall agree to hold the Medford Public Schools, the city of Medford, the Medford School Committee, the superintendent of schools, their agents, officers, and employees harmless for all property damage or personal injury, including death resulting from the negligence of users relating to the use of the facilities, grounds, equipment, or furniture. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1587.148s">Nothing</a> about our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1590.929s">Nothing</a> about our faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1593.253s">They're</a> saying, if something happens in that building, you're not going to hold the superintendent liable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1598.881s">God</a> forbid, you ain't going to hold him liable, even though he signs off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1602.646s">You're</a> not going to hold the school committee, who's responsible for this liable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1606.928s">So</a> who do we hold responsible when we allow a 21-year-old, because that's what the agreement says, you can rent if you're 21, a 21-year-old to come in and rent to any one of our buildings, invite hundreds of people, and that's not a fabrication, it currently takes place now, hundreds of people with no ID, no quarry check, we don't know what purpose other than what's stated on the form they're there for, we don't know what they're leaving behind in these schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1639.312s">And</a> we don't have any security personnel to oversee this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1646.756s">Again,</a> renters must be 21 years age or older to rent a school facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1651.859s">No</a> quarry check is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1654.06s">Another</a> omission. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1656.021s">Right</a> now, Mr. President, if I want to go up and put a local access show on Community Access, they quarry check me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1664.886s">If</a> I want to go rent the McGlynn School, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1669.123s">No</a> quarry check, no security, and I can rent that building until I'm blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1673.964s">And</a> I can invite whoever I want into that building and have access to all sections of that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1681.207s">How</a> is that security? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1684.287s">We</a> recently did a sweep because what took place? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1688.809s">Are</a> we going to do a sweep every weekend after these renters are gone? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1696.737s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1697.937s">The</a> policy doesn't come from a standpoint of public safety and security. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1703.459s">It</a> comes strictly from a financial standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1709.141s">And</a> we're not that hot up as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1713.483s">We</a> don't need it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1717.124s">We</a> don't need the additional burden, aggravation, and security concerns throughout the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1723.805s">If</a> you want to hold a city event, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1727.107s">Sponsored</a> by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1728.168s">If</a> the schools want to put on an event, that's fine in their building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1731.41s">I'm</a> not talking about school events. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1733.211s">The</a> superintendent was here two weeks ago or a week ago, and he said, well, what about the Cub Scouts? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1739.863s">I</a> mean, come on, Mr. Superintendent, we're not talking about the Cub Scouts in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1744.505s">We're</a> talking about renting our buildings to organizations or groups or individuals that we know nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1753.59s">We</a> don't know what their intent is, we don't know what their purpose is, and we can't control them under this current agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1763.915s">It</a> goes on to say, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1766.577s">The</a> user may not allow attendance at any event to exceed the rated capacity at a method facility as determined by the applicable fire and safety codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1778.046s">Where</a> is that in the policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1781.349s">Where</a> is it asking for the application? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1783.31s">I</a> just showed you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1784.131s">Where</a> is it asking to put a number? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1785.712s">How</a> many people will be here? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1787.093s">I</a> don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1790.236s">So</a> that's just language in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1791.997s">It's</a> meaningless. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1797.306s">The</a> sponsoring organization must take responsibility for ensuring that only the facility noted on the application are used and that the remaining parts of the building are not entered. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1811.411s">That's</a> like giving the fox the key to the chicken coop. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1815.932s">Here</a> you are, renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1817.133s">You're</a> only supposed to be in the cages. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1819.453s">No</a> one watching you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1820.574s">Don't</a> go in any parts of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1822.334s">You're</a> not allowed anywhere else in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1824.835s">We're</a> going to hold you responsible, Mr. Renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1828.953s">Makes</a> no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1830.253s">This</a> is when we need security up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1832.694s">This</a> is when we need a supervisor up there to monitor our facilities and making sure they're maintained in a safe and adequate fashion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1842.777s">No</a> individual will be admitted to the school building before the arrival of an adult supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1848.819s">So</a> until that 21-year-old gets there, no one's going to be admitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1855.002s">who</a> must be at least 21 years of age, and no individual may remain in the building without such supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1861.865s">Putting</a> a lot of emphasis on these renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1864.726s">These</a> renters are now self-policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1866.907s">They're</a> responsible now for everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1871.008s">Custodians</a> have been given special instruction to enforce regulations strictly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1877.691s">Another</a> responsibility for our custodians. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1881.391s">The</a> superintendent said that he used them to sweep areas for bombs at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1886.693s">Now</a> we have them overseeing all our facilities to make sure there's adequate people responsible that should be there for the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1898.796s">The</a> applicant will be responsible for all attendees involved in the function, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1903.478s">participants,</a> observers, and anyone who enters the building when it is under the control of the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1910.08s">He's</a> solely responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1912.72s">Any</a> given Saturday, you can go up to high school, and there's events up there, not gonna mention names, that have 600 or so people that attend the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1922.827s">It's</a> well attended, and it's been going on for years, and it's a great event. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1928.57s">But</a> there is no supervision other than this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1932.556s">They</a> supervise themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1934.477s">They</a> have access to every classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1936.538s">They</a> have access to the cafeteria, the intercom system, all the lecture halls, you name it, they have access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1944.321s">They</a> even have rooms under their own lock and key. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1947.462s">That's</a> how big the high school is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1949.123s">They</a> will give them a dedicated room. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1951.224s">Here,</a> you can store stuff in this particular room at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1954.885s">Welcome</a> to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1956.786s">We'll</a> do anything we can to keep you as a renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1960.747s">Security</a> need not apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1962.448s">Then</a> it goes on to say, the custodial staff shall have no responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1971.053s">So</a> before they had a responsibility to make sure that someone was 21 that was there present. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1975.836s">The</a> custodial staff shall have no responsibility to the user group beyond coordinating access and assisting in the location of electrical outlets and light switches. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1988.486s">No</a> other responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=1990.366s">So</a> if the superintendent says, well, they're the eyes and ears when we have a function, and they're out there to make sure things are happening, not according to this policy, they have no responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2000.829s">Those</a> who use school facilities must actively supervise all participants and attendees and enforce this rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2009.771s">They're</a> responsible, the renter, for enforcing the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2015.142s">Doesn't</a> sound like a safe environment to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2018.104s">Doesn't</a> sound like a place that I would feel comfortable after using to allow our children, Mr. President, to go back into these buildings, knowing that we don't know what was brought into these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2029.632s">We</a> don't know what was left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2031.133s">Maybe</a> something was mistakenly left behind that could cause injury to a first grader, a second grader, a third grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2038.838s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2041.0s">And</a> we'll never know under this current policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2045.493s">I</a> would ask, Mr. President, that my resolution, which states that the Medford School Committee immediately review and revise the policy to the Medford Public Schools rental to only permit school and community sponsored events until there is a complete safety review, also be amended to include mandatory security personnel and school building supervisors to be present at all Medford Public School facility rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2071.939s">And</a> at that point, Mr. President, I would hope that the school committee does their due diligence and homework to make sure that we don't have to worry when a building's rented on a Saturday or a Sunday, that when our students show up on a Monday, that that building is secure. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2089.211s">And</a> as far as I'm concerned, and this may sound like a hard approach, I don't think we should be renting our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2097.907s">I</a> really don't think we should be renting our school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2100.848s">If</a> you want to rent the pool at the high school or the gymnasium, they have security up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2105.91s">They</a> have someone that's in the front that acts as a supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2108.991s">It's</a> a community schools concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2112.053s">I'm</a> all in favor of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2113.953s">But</a> to wholesale rent all our facilities without the proper supervision and security, I think we're setting ourselves up, Mr. President, for a disaster to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2124.137s">And</a> I'm not going to wait for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2127.435s">I</a> thank you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2208.213s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2209.542s">I</a> just wanted to let it be known that this document is available on the school website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2214.147s">So</a> it'd be like going on the City of Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2216.109s">This</a> is available for anyone to look at, not only this council, anyone in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2220.354s">So</a> I just want people to know that that's out there, and it's as easy as clicking on their website to get a copy of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2226.241s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2226.942s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Martins. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2228.695s">Council</a> Member Craig.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2407.572s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2408.793s">Um,</a> my, my resolution, uh, does not say that the city council will craft a new request form. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2416.161s">It</a> doesn't say it'll craft a new facilities rental agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2420.405s">It</a> doesn't say the school committee must do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2423.027s">It</a> must do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2424.409s">We're</a> making a recommendation as elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2428.083s">And</a> we have every right as a concerned, not only elected official, but as a concerned parent and a resident in this community to make sure that our wishes are also carried out, Mr. President, and our concerns are carried out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2443.177s">So</a> by no means is this usurping of the school committee's authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2448.742s">It's</a> great that they waited for something to happen, and now they're acting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2452.906s">I</a> brought this issue up for the last four years to the superintendent, to the school committee, publicly at this meeting, and it fell on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2459.91s">And</a> now they're acting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2461.11s">Great</a> for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2462.631s">Great</a> for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2463.412s">They're</a> acting now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2466.113s">I</a> just don't believe, Mr. President, that for us, we should be able to give guidance and our input on what we believe needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2479.721s">And</a> that's what I did tonight, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2522.309s">Counsel</a> Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2524.029s">Mr.</a> President, the council's been on the council for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2528.317s">He</a> knows much of what we say up here are recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2531.887s">And</a> that's all that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2532.889s">So</a> he can go based on any wording he believes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2536.313s">But</a> I could just tell you when I went head-to-head with the superintendent and voted against budgets, I wish I had that same support of some of the members of this council before anything happened, Mr. President, not after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2548.2s">So</a> to make a recommendation tonight to improve security in our schools is well under the purview of this council, and it's a recommendation, and that's all it is, is a recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2559.707s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3357.143s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3358.402s">It</a> would be up to the school committee to decide what they consider security. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3361.824s">We</a> currently have security officers at the school department, we have police personnel in the community, so it would be under their purview to figure out who they want there as security. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3371.811s">But</a> having an organization or a group determine their own security and who they internally will report as security, to me is inadequate and not a prudent way of operating.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3752.698s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3753.619s">I</a> want to thank council Longo current for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3756.542s">Uh,</a> this is a logical next step, especially because of the proximity to, uh, the Andrew school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3763.028s">And</a> I support this tonight, Mr. President on the motion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4303.015s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4314.682s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4317.418s">Councilor</a> Knox. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4318.498s">Just</a> if I could, on Mildred Ionesa, I just wanted to say a few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4323.701s">I've</a> known Mildred for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4326.942s">And</a> she's always had a smile on her face, a good word to say about people, and a true family person that family always came first. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4338.107s">And</a> she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5502.758s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5503.739s">I</a> want to thank the gentleman and the young lady for speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5508.342s">They</a> brought up some very valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5510.523s">I</a> too have the same concerns as my council colleague has mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5515.085s">And</a> it was just recently, Mr. President, that this council took some <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5520.379s">a</a> pretty big action to go against a potential development on Locust Street and to help alleviate some concerns that Director Butters had as well as neighbors in an area. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5533.505s">And</a> we went as far as to ask for outside legal counsel to help us with an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5539.168s">And</a> we got to a point right now that the mayor just sent out a correspondent saying she no longer is going to fund that outside counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5546.811s">And</a> here we have the mayor going off on her own <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5550.393s">Because</a> as far as I know, the school committee met in the committee of the whole or whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5556.714s">They</a> can't take formal votes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5558.914s">It's</a> like us in the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5560.675s">We</a> could take a vote in the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5562.455s">It</a> has to come out on the floor for a formal vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5565.396s">As</a> far as I know, that never took place with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5568.256s">I</a> don't think they're following their own procedures and protocol. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5571.737s">And</a> I don't know how the mayor can unilaterally make a decision to hire someone without going through the proper procurement laws <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5579.758s">and</a> so forth that are requirements.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5586.2s">No,</a> I saw it on the news on several stations.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5598.163s">Well,</a> I think the mayor may have stated it as it was just mentioned, but it would be nice, what's going on in this community, to get some type of correspondence. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5608.045s">Wouldn't</a> that be nice for the mayor to reach out to the council and say, hey, this is what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5613.106s">This</a> is what's happening in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5615.326s">This</a> is what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5616.306s">We</a> just had a sweep. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5617.727s">We're</a> doing X, Y, and Z. Not one correspondence in the last 12 days from this mayor to this elected body. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5625.708s">Maybe</a> someone else received it, and if they did, they could step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5628.851s">Not</a> one correspondence, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5631.413s">But</a> then again, we hear leadership that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5634.075s">We</a> hear this and that coming from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5637.538s">And</a> this administration does not correspond with us, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5642.542s">And</a> that's a telltale sign of a government that's going in the wrong direction, let me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5647.566s">So...</a> Point of information, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5699.628s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5701.228s">I</a> stated what I had to state, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5703.509s">Um,</a> I'd like to see to the answers, uh, that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5707.157s">former</a> Councilor Penter and Councilor Longo asked for, so I would ask that be in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we send that to the city administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5886.603s">If</a> the school committee never formally voted on it, how is it a school committee matter?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5897.768s">Right,</a> because the mayor hasn't communicated with us, that's why we're trying to get answers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5902.834s">Right,</a> so I would recommend that this, or make a motion to be sent to the city administration, as well as the school committee.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6007.436s">But</a> I was at, through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6008.876s">Mr.</a> President, please, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6011.807s">With</a> all due respect, with all due respect about notification, we weren't even notified that there was a magazine found in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6017.769s">So</a> you're saying that's not true? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6019.849s">I</a> mean, you know, the notification thing is out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6023.07s">You</a> know, we haven't been notified from day one on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6026.391s">And</a> I have to believe when I hear the mayor say she hired Martha Coakley, when I read in the paper, when I see it on the local news. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6032.153s">We</a> don't know of any cost or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6033.673s">I</a> have to, you're right, we don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6035.514s">That's</a> why we're asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6036.794s">But</a> I have to believe there's some truth to it when I see it in all these, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6040.315s">different</a> media venues. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6042.876s">I</a> have to believe this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6043.596s">I'm</a> true to it.<h2><a href="../2018-02-21_Gg6yNgxPzRA/2018-02-21_Gg6yNgxPzRA.html">Medford City Council 02/20/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=248.715s">I</a> would just add that where the CPA now is in effect in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=253.36s">and</a> one of the options for the CPA money that's available is affordable housing, that that also be looked at, Mr. President, to see what funding is available to assist in low to moderate and affordable housing within our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1310.682s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1311.823s">And</a> I hate to interrupt you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1313.563s">It'd</a> be helpful if you can point out timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1317.085s">When</a> was it brought to the principal's office as you make your presentation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1321.327s">Happy</a> to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1322.067s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1901.095s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1903.537s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. Superintendent, two points.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1906.519s">The</a> decision that was made that this wasn't a serious incident <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1910.285s">Who</a> else was in consultation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1912.006s">Was</a> the chief of police involved in this conversation?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1938.911s">Okay,</a> and my other point was, at the beginning of your speech, you mentioned that the clip, the magazine clip, potentially had three to four bullets, which is pretty specific to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1950.961s">And</a> at any point, did you receive a picture of this, even though the principal stated he did not have the clip, or doesn't recall ever seeing the clip? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1962.471s">At</a> what point did you see the clip itself?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2001.211s">So</a> in your opinion, you just mentioned that you want to make the public feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2005.899s">And</a> in your opinion, finding a magazine clip in a K through 8 school <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2013.137s">doesn't</a> rise to the nature of seriousness to notify local police department, notify faculty, notify parents, notify students that there is an investigation that is gonna take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2028.304s">You</a> didn't even feel it was at that level where you notify people in the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2039.27s">That's</a> debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2042.112s">We've</a> had a bomb incident, Mr. Superintendent, that your own school committee created a policy where serious incidents had to be reported immediately by the administration, which clearly wasn't followed in this case.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2075.931s">There's</a> no debate, Mr. Superintendent, when you find a magazine, Mr. Superintendent, that there is a concern within a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2087.799s">There's</a> no debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2088.879s">I</a> don't see how you can say that it didn't rise to that particular level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2092.602s">I</a> would question your judgment if you honestly believe that that doesn't rise to a level where you should be notifying at least public safety officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2106.654s">And</a> I say with all due respect, Mr. Superintendent, because we've known each other for a lot of years, but I really don't see how that doesn't rise to a level in this day and age that people should be notified, especially after the incidences that we've had in this community where there's been a lack of notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2125.105s">I</a> thought we were past that stage and the best policy is 100% notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2131.332s">and</a> then let the administrators and the police do what they have to do, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2135.536s">So</a> I'd like to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2136.676s">Thank</a> you, counsel.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4069.664s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4071.404s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4072.945s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, in my opinion, it's clear that <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4078.217s">if</a> this wasn't brought to certain people's attention in the community, this would have never came out in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4087.12s">That's</a> my own feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4089.361s">And</a> again, we can talk about best practices, we could talk about additional funding for cameras, we could talk about new policies and procedures, and all that can be negated by one bad judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4104.284s">All</a> that, any policies and procedures in place can all be negated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4108.145s">And</a> I think that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4109.685s">I</a> do think we have policies and procedures in place that weren't followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4113.746s">And</a> I know you take responsibility now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4117.127s">You</a> mentioned about coordinated and uncoordinated efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4121.288s">I</a> would consider what took place an uncoordinated effort internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4126.049s">Would</a> you not?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4134.394s">I</a> don't think that was full coordination, but clearly part of part of coordination is notification, correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4145.377s">My</a> other point, and I'm not a Johnny come lately on the issue is year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4150.079s">I've</a> been questioning you regarding the rentals of our school buildings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4155.991s">And</a> year after year, we've had debates, many at this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4160.536s">And</a> I'm not going to rehash all the different debates, but I do feel strongly, Mr. Superintendent, you promised me you'd look into this, that many of our buildings are rented out to outside organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4174.511s">that</a> have no affiliation with this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4177.273s">We</a> do no background checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4179.214s">We</a> have no idea who are entering, exiting, what they're bringing into these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4184.818s">And</a> in my opinion, when it's mentioned to you, you kind of shrug it off and say, well, we can't crawl up and hide in a ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4196.346s">We</a> rent our buildings out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4197.847s">And</a> I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4199.508s">But</a> the safety and security of our children and our faculty should come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4204.831s">And</a> if it comes to telling a program that they're no longer welcome back in this community because we choose not to rent out our buildings to make an additional 25 or 30 grand a year, which is a pittance, to be quite honest with you, in the scheme of a city budget, to me would lend a lot more peace of mind to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4225.575s">We've</a> had this discussion about the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4227.896s">After</a> 3 o'clock, we don't have one security person on at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4234.071s">After</a> three o'clock, as you know, there's extracurricular activities, there's after school programs, and there's not one person at the high school that's there for security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4244.355s">I</a> don't count custodians, I know you do, for security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4248.216s">I</a> don't count having faculty around that they're security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4252.938s">And</a> I think that's a real breach of a safe and secure building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4257.92s">And</a> I just can't see why you can't see that, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4261.559s">And</a> again, it concerns me about a lack of judgment when it comes to having people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4267.44s">We</a> don't know what they're bringing into these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4269.921s">We</a> really don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4270.741s">In</a> this day and age, Mr. Superintendent, I think it's best to err on the side of safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4275.422s">And</a> I know you mentioned about Cub Scouts, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4278.723s">And</a> we don't want to make Cub Scouts not come into our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4281.563s">I'm</a> talking about outside organizations that have no city affiliation, that you don't know who's going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4290.839s">Chief</a> of Police doesn't know who's entering these buildings, and we don't know what they're doing inside these buildings, but they do have access to classrooms, to auditoriums, to cafeterias, and to a host of things within our building, and that's of grave concern, and something that no policy or procedure is going to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4308.784s">We</a> have to take an internal approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4310.956s">saying,</a> is this what we really want out of our buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4313.978s">Is</a> it worth the public safety? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4315.599s">Is</a> it worth the wear and tear? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4317.44s">I</a> don't believe so, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4319.361s">And</a> I don't think we could just shrug our shoulders year after year and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4323.383s">We've</a> had no incidences. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4324.444s">We're</a> doing fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4325.885s">This</a> could have been an incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4327.606s">If</a> you found some flour, sugar, and frosting underneath the seat in the auditorium, you would say they're baking a cake. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4335.05s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4336.051s">But</a> you find a magazine with bullets, and you don't think there's any serious nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4340.414s">That</a> there's no affiliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4352.782s">I</a> really believe, Mr. Superintendent, that someone needs to be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4357.455s">Someone</a> needs to be held. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4359.158s">You</a> don't want to discuss particular personnel matters, and I agree, this is not the forum to discuss it, but someone needs to be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4367.209s">How</a> can you be cleaning your office the day after this took place? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4371.004s">take</a> a magazine off the shelf and say, oh, this doesn't look like my pocket pen or this doesn't, and discard it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4380.567s">How</a> does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4381.868s">Unless</a> your office is a filthy mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4385.609s">I</a> don't understand how that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4387.23s">I</a> really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4389.018s">And</a> even if it does look like a cell phone, how many people throw cell phones out? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4393.322s">I</a> mean, I just don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4395.645s">It</a> seems to me the perfect, and I hate to use the words, the perfect coverup to something that should have been reported immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4409.991s">We're</a> not here to alarm people, I agree with you, but having administrators, having faculty, having parents, having them make that decision whether this is serious or not, whether they want to send their kids to school, is up to them, Mr. Superintendent, and not up to you making an individual, standalone decision on whether you think it rises to an area of such seriousness that people should be aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4434.549s">I</a> really am very disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4437.45s">I</a> have to say, Mr. Superintendent, I know you're stepping down soon and I wish you well in your retirement, but honestly, I'm very disappointed in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4447.853s">I'm</a> very disappointed that it's taken seven weeks to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4451.744s">into</a> the public and just barely come out, and only because I think people found out about it and raised awareness that it came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4460.31s">Otherwise,</a> I think it would have been brushed under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4462.832s">And</a> it would lead me to believe what else is being brushed under the rug that we should be aware of.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4614.943s">Well,</a> I don't think it's enough responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4617.103s">But</a> needless to say, at the beginning of your speech, you made mention, and you referenced it, that that building was rented prior to what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4626.725s">And</a> I believe you mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4627.986s">And</a> you can correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4630.286s">You</a> mentioned that to allude that this was probably brought in from somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4635.687s">This</a> wasn't a student bringing it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4637.928s">This</a> was probably someone that came into our building through a rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4642.709s">Is</a> that not correct, Mr. Superintendent?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4653.182s">So</a> that leads you to believe that we should be looking at who's renting our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4658.405s">Shouldn't</a> that lead you to believe that we do need security, Mr. Superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4663.828s">Do</a> you have security when you rent these buildings there?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4672.752s">I'm</a> talking about the McGlynn schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4674.413s">There's</a> security there.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4691.32s">We</a> could talk as we've done in the past few years until we're blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4695.103s">We</a> just don't see eye to eye on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4697.445s">And</a> I hope it never amounts to anything other than just talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4700.447s">But</a> I think we need to take a serious look at, Mr. President, our rentals, which the superintendent told me for the last, I think, four or five budget periods that it's being looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4713.334s">Is</a> it being looked at? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4713.954s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4714.594s">Maybe</a> it's being looked at.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4729.799s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8982.222s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8983.703s">Paper</a> of Council Resolution 17-795 was a proposed amendment to Chapter 94, Article 2, Division 1, relative to the expanded notification of certain public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8995.065s">We</a> received the response back in our packet, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8997.475s">from</a> the Community Development Board dated February 12th, 2018, and I would ask that a Committee of the Whole meeting be set up to discuss this particular response from Community Development Board, and this be a paper review referred to Committee of the Whole.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9025.933s">Mr.</a> President, we received correspondence from the city solicitor in our packet tonight, dated February 16th, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9034.319s">It's</a> to Mayor Burke from Mark Rumley regarding Council Paper 18041, request for an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9043.665s">This</a> was, I won't read the whole thing, this was a request of opinion from Council and Knight regarding has the Board of Health exceeded their authority with the regulatory passage of a smoking ban in private clubs? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9055.934s">where</a> an exemption for smoking ban on private clubs is outlined in the city ordinance 58-43. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9062.999s">The</a> correspondence that we received back from the city solicitor stated that he believes that the Board of Health, and I'm not speaking on his behalf, this is how I interpret it, that he believes the Board of Health did exceed their authority in the passage of that smoking ban <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9085.356s">and</a> what he refers to membership associations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9089.259s">And</a> I would ask that this paper, because we were supposed to be following up on this, be referred either to a committee of the whole or some, be open to a subcommittee, whatever the council feels fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9107.133s">And</a> if there's any, I think we have someone that'd like to speak on it tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9565.977s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9567.558s">Uh,</a> in the spirit of cooperation, uh, as part of paper 18 0 dash, uh, 0 4 1, there was a B paper and I had a re recent discussion after the city solicitor issued his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9580.465s">And</a> if anyone recalls the B paper was requesting that, uh, these particular service clubs, or if you want to refer to them as membership associations, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9589.04s">have</a> a dedicated smoking area and we asked that as a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9593.626s">In</a> my discussion with the city solicitor, he thought it would be wise to put some language within our city ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9601.989s">is</a> requesting that member associations have an alternative, which would be a dedicated smoking area within their facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9611.994s">And</a> as Councilor Knight mentioned, that would be up to the membership to decide where, when, and if they want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9618.857s">But</a> I think that's appropriate that we have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9624.28s">It's</a> a matter of crafting really a sentence <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9626.949s">of</a> language into the city ordinance of 58-43. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9631.591s">And</a> I think it would, in my opinion, solve all problems for members that feel they have the right to smoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9638.093s">And</a> they do have the right to smoke, in my opinion, but in a dedicated area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9642.635s">Like</a> any other establishment, we all have workplaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9646.376s">There's</a> areas even here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9648.437s">You</a> can't smoke anywhere around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9650.457s">You</a> can't even smoke outside the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9652.618s">There's</a> a dedicated area across about 30 feet from City Hall where is the dedicated smoking area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9659.499s">And</a> I think that would suit well for Captain Brennan and some of the concerns he raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9664.3s">Those</a> numbers that he's mentioning are alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9667.241s">And</a> that's only one particular establishment they're alarming of the number of cases of cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9672.698s">and</a> people that frequent these particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9675.72s">So</a> I would ask that this correspondence from the mayor be sent to a committee of the whole meeting and to discuss the dedicated smoking area and membership associations.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9742.577s">Mr.</a> President, I would also ask that as far as I know, I know the city solicitor did an opinion, but as far as I know, these particular organizations in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9752.426s">have</a> not received any formal correspondence from the city, whether it's the Board of Health or from the city clerk's office, and I think it's only appropriate to let them know what the opinion is, and if truly they are allowed to smoke now in the building, they should be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9769.719s">And</a> it'll be up to the council to get together on this and try and iron out something that's amendable to all parties.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9798.673s">Right,</a> but he's more or less saying if you were stopping people from smoking there now, you can't do that according to his opinion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9810.919s">Right,</a> and it's important that all the service organizations know that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9816.103s">I</a> think we can solve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9817.123s">I</a> think with the Committee of the Whole meeting, get all the parties together, I think it's common sense.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9840.493s">Committee</a> to the whole, it's possible.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9998.835s">I've</a> been neglecting my duties, Mr. President, even more.<h2><a href="../2017-12-19_AW1lkvnNQcg/2017-12-19_AW1lkvnNQcg.html">Medford, MA City Council   Nov  28, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=395.851s">Mr.</a> President, I know on the agenda also Councilor Scarpelli has a similar paper, if you'd like to read that also.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=421.259s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=422.64s">And</a> I was recently contacted by a resident that happens to take that bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=429.065s">If</a> anyone's familiar, this bus stop is located on South Porter Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=439.733s">If</a> you're not familiar with it, it's the picnic bench that's been out there for some time now that is considered the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=449.541s">And</a> this particular resident contacted me, said not only is this bus stop kind of in a bad area, being placed around the Rotary at Roosevelt Circle, which is a highly traveled and fast-paced area, but the fact that there's a picnic bench there does not lend itself to public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=473.337s">and</a> or discourages people from using that as a legit bus shelter stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=483.031s">And</a> this particular location would be a prime location for a bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=488.635s">to</a> protect residents that use that, I believe the 325 and the 100 bus both go by that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=496.578s">And</a> it would protect residents and commuters from the rain and snow and the inclement weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=505.16s">It</a> also, Mr. President, in my opinion, would increase ridership at that particular location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=510.842s">And</a> Rep Donato reached out to me just recently <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=514.023s">and</a> said he's been working with some of the residents in that particular area that contacted his office to erect a bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=524.014s">And</a> the MBTA told them they do a ridership count, and they recently performed one. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=530.433s">and</a> said roughly 28 people use that particular bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=534.856s">And</a> the MBTA will not consider a bus shelter unless it's 50 or more people that use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=542.061s">But</a> what I think, Mr. President, is the old issue that you have a shelter or a bus stop that's located in really a poor area in regards to traffic flow and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=558.007s">and</a> safety of commuters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=560.747s">And</a> it also discourages people from standing there waiting to catch the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=567.069s">So</a> hence why the numbers of ridership may be down based on that current location, based on the fact that there's not a shelter that makes it look like, hey, this is a legit bus stop, rather than you're out there having a picnic off of 93 at a picnic bench. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=585.652s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=588.15s">This</a> council send a request to the MBTA to erect a bus shelter at South Border Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Rotary in the interest of public safety, which services riders on the 325 and 100 bus, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=608.103s">We</a> may also have a resident here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=610.424s">I</a> don't know if Barney's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=612.765s">She</a> said she was going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=614.233s">And</a> if we can also listen to Bonnie, who wants to speak on the issue, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1012.711s">Just</a> if I could, and I've brought up this fact a number of times, the MBTA assesses this city, the city of Medford, over I believe it's $3 million a year to operate the MBTA in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1027.518s">And</a> we all pay for it as riders. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1029.659s">We</a> pay through the sales tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1032.74s">There's</a> a percent that goes towards <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1034.717s">the</a> operation of transit in this state. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1038.742s">And</a> I think, Mr. President, I believe we're in the top maybe five or six in assessment in this state from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1047.093s">That</a> money comes right off our cherry sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1049.376s">So</a> it's money that goes right out of <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1051.498s">the</a> city coffers, and it's based on services they're providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1056.082s">And</a> I would state, Mr. President, that we need to take a long, hard look at many of our bus stops, many of the shelters that do exist in the city, the creation of not just <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1069.213s">this</a> shelter, but many other shelters in prime locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1073.594s">In</a> the square, you have bus stops that hundreds of residents wait on a daily basis to take the bus there, and there's no shelters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1082.937s">You</a> know, I think the T has to do a better job, Mr. President, in this community, and I'm hoping, like Councilor Scarpelli, that we get a quick response to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1095.08s">And</a> also, Mr. President, based on the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1097.677s">We're</a> one of a few communities that are paying such a heavy fee to have bus transportation, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1105.438s">I</a> like John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1107.057s">take</a> the bus every day also. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1109.118s">But</a> I can tell you, Mr. President, the access that we get in this community is not just for Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1116.361s">We're</a> paying a hefty fee to make sure people from all surrounding communities that jump on our express bus and all the other transit methods that we have, we're paying for their ridership as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1128.567s">And</a> I think, really, we need to make sure that the MBTA sees fit to make sure this community is getting its fair share.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1161.617s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1988.344s">Vice</a> President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1990.145s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1992.072s">I</a> can't support this resolution tonight based on the fact that I agree with my colleagues that this is something that hasn't been approved by the council as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2000.641s">And</a> I'm not going to partake in something that is going to tell residents that they can get out of something that the council is going to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2009.05s">Um,</a> and in my opinion, what we should do, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2012.492s">and</a> I've stated this from day one, Mr. President is, uh, the energy and environment committee where this was sent at one point in this process, um, had a public hearing on it and we asked the city solicitor to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2025.499s">And</a> one of the questions, and it was actually my question was whether or not we can file a home rule petition on behalf of this city and change the legislation, which, uh, is everyone is opted into the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2040.106s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2041.969s">automatically</a> and change it so you can opt into the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2049.54s">And</a> according to Mark Rumley, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, he spoke to House Counsel <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2056.856s">at</a> the statehouse and they believe that we could file a home loan petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2061.641s">And</a> that is my number one concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2064.564s">In</a> my opinion, when you get into utilities, that's between a homeowner and the utility company, not between the homeowner, the utility company, and the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2076.056s">I</a> don't think we have any business getting involved, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2080.139s">I</a> realize this is a good intention to reduce our carbon footprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2085.984s">I</a> realize that supposedly there's a cost benefit to by aggregating everyone together. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2092.289s">And</a> so I realize what the intent is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2096.313s">But</a> I, as one member of the council, don't feel that everyone should be opted in automatically to a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2103.879s">And</a> if this is such a great program, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2106.121s">It's</a> going to be overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2107.182s">People</a> will be knocking on the door here at City Hall to get involved and say, I want to opt into that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2113.866s">Let</a> the program work. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2115.707s">Let</a> the program work. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2116.968s">So</a> that would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2119.005s">Mr.</a> President, that eventually, when we do discuss this again, that we file a home rule petition to reverse it, Mr. President, because the state legislature made a mistake, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2130.368s">Maybe</a> it wasn't a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2131.648s">Maybe</a> it was intentional that they realized that, you know, a good majority of the people aren't going to opt out of the program, leaving them in the program, and that's where they're going to get their numbers from. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2141.95s">That's</a> why they intended it and crafted the legislation that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2145.572s">I</a> don't believe that should be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2147.473s">I</a> believe we should give residents of this community an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2151.115s">If</a> they want to opt into the program, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2154.136s">You</a> can opt into the program, and I hope you save money, and I hope we move forward to reducing our carbon footprint, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2161.6s">There's</a> also a section that I understand within this legislation that also allows a community to purchase more green energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2171.722s">And</a> you can do it on a one-to-one basis, but the community can decide as a community, saying, you know what, the 15% that we're required to buy, you know, we want to up it to 25 or 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2184.573s">Now</a> that's going to be a cost to everyone else in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2188.336s">And</a> you can opt out of that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2190.737s">But</a> now you say you can opt out of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2192.839s">And</a> if you happen not to opt out of the program, then if you don't want to pay the additional green energy, you have to opt out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2199.244s">That's</a> be up front with the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2200.865s">Let</a> them choose whether they want to partake in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2204.628s">And</a> I could support that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2206.25s">So</a> I can't support this resolution tonight because we haven't voted on any type of aggregation the way it stands.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2626.032s">Was</a> there a number six on that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2636.291s">No,</a> I, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2637.752s">I</a> thought a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2638.372s">Yeah,</a> no, they were saying if I'm not mistaken, as part of what council Longo just spoke about, um, I think I offered the motion during that meeting that, uh, as part of their detailed plan, that they also include, uh, the water hookups throughout the entire route. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2654.821s">And</a> we asked that that be provided to us at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2658.803s">And</a> I think, uh, representatives from Eversource said, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2661.324s">We</a> can't possibly get that information this quickly and so forth, but it was still a request of this council to get a plan of each hookup that they're going to be crossing over or under, water hookups.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2677.292s">Last</a> week.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2684.349s">Okay,</a> so we're not gonna, are we gonna get the next paper before next Tuesday's meeting?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2696.876s">When</a> we ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2709.005s">I</a> mean, Eversource was before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2710.626s">We</a> asked Eversource to produce some information.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2762.332s">But</a> we may not get that information before next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2766.474s">This</a> issue is coming up again, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2767.894s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2768.875s">So</a> we may not get that information prior to next Tuesday's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2775.997s">That's</a> an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2782.12s">That's</a> why I thought this was part of the paper that we were reading that included everything.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2902.807s">Vice</a> President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2904.088s">I</a> appreciate Councilman Light sharing that information and knowing that any approval comes before the mayor and also the council as a two-pronged approach, it would be very helpful maybe in future projects <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2917.523s">that</a> the administration sit down with this council and say, you know, we're crafting an MOU, memorandum of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2924.607s">You</a> have partial approval of the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2928.43s">What</a> are your thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2929.871s">And</a> that would have been helpful, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2931.672s">So</a> now we're after the fact negotiating with the utility company that has already entered into an agreement with the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2939.586s">And</a> in my opinion, I think we have every authority, otherwise it would be just a rubber stamp body just approving things to put conditions on this, Mr. President, that make sense to the rate payers and the tax payers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2954.762s">When</a> you have a project coming into a city that has zero benefit to this community, I say zero benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2963.277s">and</a> 100% disruption, I think we have every right to stand up on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2969.262s">So</a> I look forward to speaking with the city solicitor on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3063.816s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3065.756s">As</a> the financial steward of this community, as we are as a body, and the mayor is coming before us requesting $200,000 of taxpayers' money, I would ask that the administration answer a few questions regarding this money, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3085.9s">Well,</a> if the administration appears before the podium, Mr. President, I'd be more than happy to relay my questions.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3102.691s">So</a> the mayor is presenting a paper, Mr. President, a financial paper, and not one person could take the time out of their schedule to come up before the council to answer a question regarding taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3118.485s">I</a> just want the record to reflect that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3121.237s">that</a> not one person from the city administration was here last week, and they had ample opportunity because it was tabled for a week, or here tonight, Mr. President, to answer one question on behalf of the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3135.049s">But,</a> Mr. President, I still will ask my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3140.549s">I</a> posed last week, and many of them, as representatives from the Brooks Estates quite eloquently stated, is not under the ability wig to answer why we don't have a capital plan in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3155.857s">And</a> I can appreciate the fact that representatives from the Brooks Estates, all volunteers that have been doing tremendous work to keep that <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3164.551s">building</a> and the carriage house afloat for so many years, and actually moved towards the rehabilitation of the manor and the property, have done great work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3179.258s">My</a> concern, and I reiterated this last week, is not with the Brooks Estates, is not with shoring up a building that I witnessed just recently as a building that's on the verge of collapse. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3192.664s">I</a> agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3193.783s">I</a> don't think anyone else could go over into that area or that building and say this building is not going to come down very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3200.767s">I</a> think we all agree with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3202.247s">My</a> concern, Mr. President, is why don't we have a game plan in this community on capital improvement? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3210.571s">This</a> is one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3213.373s">There</a> are a laundry list of issues that we need a capital plan for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3219.114s">Last</a> week, I mentioned the fire departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3222.455s">Each</a> fire station has dire need, Mr. President, for upgrades and renovation in the fire stations where our brave men and women spend seven days a week, 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3236.175s">That</a> is one aspect that needs a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3239.676s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that work within the confines of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3243.677s">And</a> I think we can all appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3246.678s">Over</a> the last several years, every member of this council has spoken about the poor condition of our sidewalks and our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3255.72s">And</a> based on over the years, that information, this city has put zero dollars for road replacement in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3267.126s">$0.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3268.727s">The</a> only money we get for road replacement is through Chapter 90 money through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3273.789s">It's</a> about $980,000 a year, which is not going to be enough to start even remotely replacing and repaving the streets we know we need in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3285.616s">We're</a> never going to get ahead of the game in the way we're doing business. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3289.118s">We</a> need a capital plan to address roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3294.278s">We</a> have yet to get any capital plan regarding roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3298.74s">We</a> talk about tree stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3301.541s">Do</a> we have to bring up the list again of tree stumps in this community that we just either don't have the will to take them out or don't have the funding to take them out? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3310.944s">It's</a> one or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3312.705s">I</a> would hope it's the funding and not the will to take these out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3317.366s">But</a> that's another capital plan we need to move forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3320.908s">Catch</a> basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3322.878s">Talk</a> to the DPW commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3324.639s">Go</a> down any street. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3327.161s">I'd</a> venture to say, and this is just off the top of my head, 50 to 60% of our catch basins that are capturing rain runoff water and taking it out to the Mystic River are imploding. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3340.49s">And</a> they're sinking into the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3343.712s">We're</a> not addressing these. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3345.053s">It</a> needs to be a capital issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3347.665s">It</a> needs to be a capital issue that we have to move forward to. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3350.607s">Traffic</a> calming measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3352.749s">We</a> just had a meeting about the revitalization of Method Square and the master plan, much of which calls for traffic calming plans on main street and high street and Salem street. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3365.9s">We</a> have many other streets in this community, upwards of 600 streets in this community that need the same traffic calming approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3375.009s">But</a> yet, we put nothing in the budget, or very little, I should say, to address these very important pedestrian safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3383.472s">We</a> need a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3385.533s">We're</a> moving forward on a new library. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3387.253s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3388.074s">We'll</a> probably need a capital plan for that, a portion of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3391.775s">You</a> know, we're moving forward on a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3393.976s">We're</a> probably gonna need some type of capital plan moving forward on the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3400.742s">There</a> are a lot of issues that we need a direction from this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3406.165s">The</a> easy way out is to keep on allowing this administration to sit back and not give us a capital plan and take each issue one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3420.192s">That's</a> our vision for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3422.253s">When</a> there's a need, we'll take the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3424.474s">The</a> carriage house is going to fall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3426.676s">Let's</a> take some money out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3428.477s">We'll</a> repair that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3429.687s">We'll</a> wait till the next emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3431.47s">We'll</a> take care of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3433.594s">If</a> we don't have a game plan in this community, we're never going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3437.681s">We're</a> never going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3439.901s">And</a> whether this is the carriage house or any other issue in this community, I've preached about this for years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3446.464s">And</a> members of this council, I think, can agree that we've all asked for capital plans over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3452.447s">And</a> there have been few in coming by the last administration and this current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3458.23s">So</a> I'm not going to continue to work piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3461.992s">If</a> we want to ask the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3466.53s">To</a> start looking at some of the needs we have in this community, I think we have to put our foot down at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3472.372s">The</a> easy thing is just to prove everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3474.772s">We</a> have over $8 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3477.713s">The</a> coffers are open. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3479.474s">Just</a> keep on approving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3480.794s">That's</a> the least resistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3482.274s">That's</a> just to prove everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3483.515s">But</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3484.355s">Someday,</a> those coffers are going to be closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3487.036s">Times</a> aren't going to be as good. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3488.276s">We're</a> not going to have a reserve of $8 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3491.937s">And</a> the decisions are going to get tougher and tougher. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3494.279s">And</a> that's why we need to have a game plan to tackle the most important issues, the pressing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3500.945s">So</a> tonight, Mr. President, I'd like to find out what is the vision for the Brooks Banner? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3508.888s">We</a> had a group that did Yeoman's work, and we heard about it last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3513.389s">Back</a> in 2012, they created a master plan for the Brooks Estates, and how the Brooks Estates is gonna be able to be self-sustaining and reinvest back into the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3525.613s">And</a> part of that vision was to use the carriage house as the economic engine, as a function hall, to generate money that we could put into road repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3539.096s">I</a> said this last week, and I hope people from the Brooks Estates don't get offended. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3543.599s">You</a> need a four-wheel truck to get up to the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3547.121s">And</a> if you make it up there in a four-wheel pickup truck, you're lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3550.563s">That's</a> how bad that road is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3552.924s">It's</a> awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3553.664s">It</a> needs over a million and a half dollars of repair and underground utility. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3559.408s">There's</a> a lot of work that needs to take place up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3562.209s">What's</a> the vision? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3563.73s">We</a> were presented with the vision in 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3565.791s">And</a> what did this council do? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3569.841s">We</a> sat on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3571.561s">Five</a> years later, now we're talking about buckling up the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3576.422s">Let's</a> put an envelope over it and let it sit there for another five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3581.403s">That's</a> our vision for the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3583.563s">That's</a> what we're doing for historic preservation in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3589.164s">Let's</a> bring the plan out again. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3591.325s">Let's</a> discuss the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3593.005s">Let's</a> see what our direction is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3595.945s">If</a> it's the druthers of this council not to approve the plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3600.106s">again</a> or not to ask for additional information, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3605.691s">But</a> to wait five years and then put a band-aid approach to just putting a capsule over the building, yes, it will preserve the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3614.038s">But</a> we're still in the same spot we were, Mr. President, the same spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3618.282s">We're</a> not moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3620.084s">As</a> Mr. Lincoln eloquently said last week, this is a city-owned building, no different than Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3629.397s">The</a> city has to step up to the plate and take ownership. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3633.758s">And</a> ownership is not putting a band-aid on a much larger problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3637.86s">So</a> that would be my question to the mayor, or if your staff was here, what's the vision for the building for future use? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3646.578s">Do</a> you have the same vision that the Brooks Estates has? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3649.72s">Completely</a> restore two buildings, the Shepherd Brooks Manor and the Carriage House for public benefit, restore historic landscape, open space, natural habitat, capture the historic look and feel, promote biodiversity, improve habitat values, create the necessary economic engine to ensure long-term self-sufficiency of the property? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3670.874s">Is</a> that the mayor's goal? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3673.916s">That's</a> what I'd like to know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3675.681s">We're</a> putting $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3677.566s">Is</a> that the mayor's goal? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3679.049s">Is</a> the mayor going to come up with a capital plan that includes the Brooks estates? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3684.175s">These</a> are the questions I think we, as the financial stewards in this community, should be asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3689.94s">And</a> the quick knee-jerk reaction, I've talked to a lot of people, I got a lot of emails, Tommy did a great job, got a lot of emails from residents of this community, and actually it enlightened me on a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3701.71s">And</a> I found myself, which many residents said, that's compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3707.015s">We</a> need to secure the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3708.676s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3710.145s">You</a> know, we had a member of this council five years ago that said, let's tear down the building and build a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3718.109s">I</a> mean, that was the thought five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3722.091s">I</a> don't know how they're going to vote now, but maybe they have a change in heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3727.053s">But</a> I would ask Mr. President that this be a condition on the paper that the city administration present the council within the next six months <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3740.129s">After</a> approval tonight, a capital plan addressing the city needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3745.011s">You</a> will have my vote tonight if we can get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3748.132s">I</a> think that's a simple request. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3750.713s">We</a> can move ahead with the $200,000, and we're asking as a council, which we should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3756.095s">I</a> think that should be unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3758.056s">Madam</a> Mayor, present us with a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3760.957s">You</a> have six months to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3763.898s">Present</a> us with a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3765.239s">Let</a> us know your directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3766.759s">Let</a> us know if it includes the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3769.551s">because</a> these are the decisions we have to make as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3774.136s">And</a> I'm prepared to make a decision either way tonight, but I thought if the people I spoke with that sent me emails and through my phone conversations, that this would be a great compromise to move the paper forward and also have an understanding that, Madam Mayor, we're gonna hold your feet to the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3792.691s">We're</a> going to make sure you're accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3794.392s">You</a> may not want to come out with a list of things that you want to accomplish, because then we can measure you by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3801.636s">So</a> you may not want that on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3803.457s">But</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3804.578s">We</a> as a city need to have that on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3807.199s">We</a> need that to move issues forward in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3810.441s">So</a> that would be my condition on this paper, Mr. President, that the administration present the council within the next six months, after approval tonight, a capital plan addressing all city needs.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3847.412s">It's</a> not a condition to spend your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3849.032s">It's</a> a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3850.693s">If</a> I could have my mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3854.685s">This</a> is first of all a financial paper and the council has purview over whether we approve it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3860.429s">So</a> we can put a condition on any paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3863.291s">Secondly,</a> we do it all the time with the utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3866.394s">When</a> they come in and they ask us to do work and open our streets up and they only want to repave the little area that they do work on, we put conditions of approval based on the fact that they have to do curb to curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3880.12s">So</a> we put conditions all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3881.941s">This</a> is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3882.781s">I</a> had a conversation with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3885.283s">I</a> won't speak for him, but this is no different than any other paper requesting us to approve something. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3891.486s">We're</a> saying we will approve this, but you also have to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3895.568s">So</a> I don't think there's any problem putting a condition as I just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3900.01s">So</a> you want a vision for the whole city or just the Brooks Manor? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3905.152s">Capital</a> plan addressing the entire city's needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3907.954s">Capital</a> plan.

href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1821.296s">You</a> always have a friend in Michael Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1824.218s">I</a> will yield to no one in my support of the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1827.479s">During</a> the past 16 years as your city councilor, I have dedicated myself to doing the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1833.577s">And</a> to this end, I've worked tirelessly to be worthy of your trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1838.14s">Over</a> that time, I've become experienced in a broad and expansive range of issues, and I would like to think I learned what makes Method heart beat. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1847.726s">The</a> revitalization of Method Square is central to our success as a thriving community on a cusp of a new, innovative future. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1856.151s">Economic</a> opportunities abound, but we must reach out for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1859.893s">Today,</a> one of those opportunities exists in plain view. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1863.034s">three</a> city-owned parcels of land on the eastern edge of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1867.297s">As</a> your city councilor, I will encourage an invigorated Office of Community Development to take a more proactive role in attracting new investment and to charting the future of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1878.062s">Seniors.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1879.223s">Seniors</a> will always be on my radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1881.263s">We</a> forged a connection many years ago while I was a novice city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1885.405s">And</a> to this day, I actively support issues important to our seniors and will continue to marshal all the resources at my disposal to ensure that seniors always get a fair shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1895.389s">You</a> guys can count on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1898.593s">As</a> your city councilor, I proposed and want approval to reduce the speed limit citywide to 25 miles an hour to create Method's first raised crosswalk, improving pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1909.696s">I</a> advocated for a complete review of our current zoning laws to encourage smart growth concepts and neighborhood protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1917.138s">I</a> proposed a resolution which resulted in an improved emergency preparedness procedures for Method public housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1924.06s">I</a> supported the hiring of a traffic engineer to review public safety, traffic calming initiatives, and roadway improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1931.165s">As</a> your city councilor, I will continue to support and offer suggestions to reduce the unrelenting airplane noise over our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1939.07s">I</a> offer the resolve which led to the home rule petition to create a charter review commission in order to review ways of improving how city government operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1948.141s">I</a> also organized a group of residents and established the Medford Dog Park Committee, securing a private grant of $250,000 from the Stanton Foundation, and we are in the process right now behind the McGlynn School and Riverbend Park to build Medford's first dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1965.048s">As</a> your city council, I successfully led the charge to take back city ownership of the Hegner Center with the intent to create Medford's first art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1973.943s">I</a> sponsored resolutions to create temporary pop-up community space in our parks, business districts, and unrented storefronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1982.209s">I</a> was the originator of the resolution to have solar panels installed in the DPW facility, reducing our carbon footprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1989.235s">As</a> a daily public transportation user, I will continue to support programs to build and improve upon public transportation in Method, including public bike paths and walkway improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1999.903s">I</a> offer the resolution which created Method's rain barrel program, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2002.925s">to</a> conserve and repurpose rain runoff water. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2005.906s">And</a> now that you know who I am and where I plan to journey with you over the next couple of years, let me finish with these words. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2011.849s">I</a> am and always have been motivated by a sense of duty.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2015.171s">A</a> summons to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2016.011s">What</a> can I do for my community? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2017.812s">And</a> how can I improve the lives of my fellow citizens? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2022.774s">And</a> yes, I have an obligation to the people of Medford to get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2026.976s">I</a> also would like to thank the Medford Firefighters Local 1032, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2032.077s">and</a> the New England Laborers for their endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2034.918s">I</a> thank you very much for your time tonight.<h2><a href="../2017-01-06_q5wtGZ49X-w/2017-01-06_q5wtGZ49X-w.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 20, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1785.901s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1787.122s">And,</a> uh, I couldn't be more happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1790.165s">Uh,</a> two years ago, uh, this council had a big borrow and steal to get $10,000 allocated in the budget to fix what I refer to as two prison bathrooms in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1805.657s">And,</a> uh, they were painted and some, uh, fixtures were replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1811.361s">Um,</a> and now we're talking about, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1814.117s">possibly</a> a $27 million brand new library, complete with community gathering spaces, which I believe is going to be a home run. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1824.585s">This</a> library will not only be a library, it'll be a central gathering place for all of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1832.19s">And</a> I have big expectations for this building now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1838.435s">I'm</a> glad to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1839.556s">I</a> know there's been talk about, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1841.87s">putting</a> in a small cafe where you can get a scone and a cup of coffee, and I think that's a great asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1848.674s">I've</a> had people in the community come up to me and say, you know, in this day and age, do we really need a new library? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1855.359s">And</a> what I tell people is that this is not the library that we all remember, where you go pull out old microfilm and sit down and maybe rent a video or so forth or a book. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1867.846s">This</a> is going to be a state-of-the-art community gathering space. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1872.387s">um,</a> and equip with the latest in technology and someplace that, uh, you want to say, Hey, I'm going to go down to the square to go to the library and, uh, it'll become a destination place. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1884.674s">So</a> I am so ecstatic to see, uh, the plans, uh, moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1888.837s">Uh,</a> I know the, uh, friends of the library been working, uh, with this building, uh, for a number of years and the new library building committee has done yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1900.272s">and</a> gathering the information needed and such a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1904.735s">Uh,</a> the question I do have is that, uh, I don't want to be a Debbie downer, but if the grant does not come through for some reason, do we have a plan B in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1915.021s">Uh,</a> because, um, I want to see something happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1918.964s">This</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1919.744s">I</a> want to see this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1921.305s">But</a> if this, for whatever reason doesn't come to fruition, I think we need to have a plan B and start moving on that plan B. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1928.212s">immediately,</a> so has there been any discussion?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1958.198s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1959.119s">Um,</a> now you mentioned, I think council Longo current asked about the construction timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1964.702s">What</a> is the total construction from, uh, putting a shovel into the ground until we actually do a ribbon cutting?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2002.185s">So</a> as part of the plans, what is going to be done to temporarily relocate the library for possibly almost a two year span?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2030.342s">So</a> has there been any consideration of potential sites?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2056.035s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2057.116s">And</a> the Magoon Room has a number of historical artifacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2062.279s">Is</a> there any discussion on using some of the Amelia Hart artifacts that are in there to enhance the library and enhance some of <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2070.543s">the</a> educational tools that we might have.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2116.119s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2117.34s">Almost</a> in the same theme that you have now, when you walk into the library, you have the display cases where you have stuff similar to that, where, uh, we may be able to turn a section of the library into, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2128.572s">come</a> and display your old political buttons like you had in there at one point.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2138.837s">That's,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2139.857s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2140.818s">Um,</a> so just, just the, uh, the last point I have, um, regarding, uh, is, uh, there any stipulation regarding the city's, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2153.499s">uh,</a> budgetary requirements, uh, in regards to, as you know, I don't have to tell you, Barbara, that, uh, over the last several years, the city has underfunded, uh, the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2163.75s">Um,</a> and, uh, is there any requirements when we apply for the grant that we have to maintain that funding at a level so that that is written into the grant document itself?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2203.942s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2205.223s">And</a> I, and I liked the suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2207.084s">I</a> realized there's no funding within the grant for the exterior landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2212.186s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2212.827s">Or,</a> uh, that council Scarpelli brought up about having interactive, um, uh, similar to what we're doing out here at the, uh, on Salem street. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2224.353s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2224.853s">I'm</a> Riverside F as you probably know, we're doing the bus shelter over, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2228.843s">and</a> that particular area to turn it into an outdoor gathering space. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2232.706s">And</a> we're going to have a number of interactive exhibits for young and middle-aged children. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2240.151s">And</a> I'd love to see something around the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2242.953s">They</a> do a great project in South Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2245.255s">My</a> kids just went recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2247.076s">And</a> they have these lit up, I can never remember the name of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2250.458s">If</a> anyone knows, if you could help me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2252.42s">They</a> have these great lit up things that you can sit in. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2255.442s">And</a> it's a big attraction.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2258.793s">Lawn</a> on D. Lawn on D. And let me tell you, it's a great attraction. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2264.418s">I'm</a> not sure what the cost is, but kids go from all over, all over to go there and be pictured with these outdoor seating, illuminated structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2276.769s">And</a> it's really just, you know, an excellent take and something that would serve as an attraction, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2287.008s">and</a> maybe something outside where we received a grant for the Riverside Ave, $250,000 for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2294.612s">It</a> might be something that we can look at for the exterior of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2299.435s">But</a> Barbara, I want to thank you in your short term as the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2303.177s">We</a> seem to be on the move.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2308.439s">Well,</a> it takes leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2311.241s">And</a> I want to thank you for your leadership and the board of the library and also the building <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2315.777s">committee</a> as well as Councilor Caraviello, I think it was about a year and a half ago, you mentioned about doing the library over and looking for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2323.798s">And</a> I think everyone looked at you like you had three heads and now we're looking at him as he has one giant head. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2330.86s">And</a> I mean that in a good way. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2331.98s">I</a> mean that in a good way. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2333.96s">Lots</a> of brains in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2334.96s">And</a> so I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for his leadership on that too.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2837.413s">Just</a> if we could, cause Mr. Cassidy brings up a great point and maybe if Barbara can answer it as part of the grant proposal, does the city have to clearly define what its maintenance will be of the building?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2864.42s">So,</a> so that is part of the grant proposal.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2867.342s">It</a> is one of the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2868.283s">So,</a> and I agree with Mr. Castagnetti that there's been a lack of oversight for many years, but we have to move on forward now and that shouldn't prevent us from creating these great new structures for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2880.211s">So,</a> um, thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3469.888s">I</a> think we should offer it as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3471.369s">Yes,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3543.219s">I</a> just want to thank, uh, Councilor Penta for bringing this to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3547.3s">I</a> did see something in the news recently, uh, regarding Mr, uh, Simons. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3552.741s">And,</a> um, I think the, um, uh, movie producers did put out a statement saying at the end, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3561.695s">They</a> thanked all who were involved and who had some type of involvement or hardship with the Marathon bombing. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3572.819s">And</a> that was the way they presented it as covering everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3577.28s">So,</a> but I want to thank Councilor Penta, Mr. President, for bringing this up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3672.176s">And</a> Mr. President, too, I'd be remiss if I didn't say something about Jean Barry Sutherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3677.618s">I</a> have known Jean for a number of years, and she was truly a dedicated professional in our Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3685.462s">She</a> was well-liked by everyone, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3689.143s">She</a> always had a smile on her face, even when she was going through very trying times over the last many years, she was there to give a positive note and positive advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3700.004s">And,</a> uh, she will solely be missed in this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4321.964s">I</a> said that is to benefit the business owners in each of our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4327.066s">And</a> I think we should get an answer before we <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4329.538s">take</a> something off our agenda, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4333.021s">Because</a> it's been on there a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4335.042s">It's</a> certainly not bothering me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4337.645s">And</a> I think it deserves, on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce and every business in this community, to get an answer on it, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4365.074s">There</a> was several questions asked, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4370.755s">That's</a> why the paper was put on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4375.316s">I</a> remember like it was yesterday that we asked <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4385.377s">that</a> if there was $250,000 reserved for the business districts that we find out who would be responsible for giving out the money to each business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4393.862s">Was</a> it going to go to the West Medford business community or was it going to go to the chamber and so forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4398.744s">So</a> we had a number of questions and maybe we have to just revisit to find out what the status is rather than just doing away with the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4406.008s">Well</a> then why don't we have a motion so we can get an answer?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4466.934s">Have</a> we ever received the full policy, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4469.154s">Because</a> that was what we asked for.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4474.116s">Can</a> we ask that we receive a copy of the full policy, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4500.384s">Yeah,</a> so if we can get a copy of the policy, that's all I'm asking.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4612.449s">So,</a> what was the question?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4614.369s">I</a> don't know what the question was.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4625.046s">So</a> that was the question that we couldn't get out to the administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4685.487s">Mr.</a> President, I'm a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4690.588s">The,</a> the fact that a paper is before us as a, as a resolution and we may have a question on the paper itself, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4698.91s">From</a> what I'm hearing from some of my colleagues, it appears that, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4702.098s">we</a> have to approve the paper in order to get questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4706.079s">And</a> I don't think that's necessarily true. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4709.06s">Mr.</a> President, I think we can request as a council to get answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4713.741s">Uh,</a> we had a Councilor Knights resolution a few weeks ago about setting up a reserve account in the city and we didn't support that as a council, but we did support sending it to the mayor to see if the mayor, um, uh, thought it was appropriate, uh, for, uh, the setting of, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4731.41s">a</a> reserve account. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4732.15s">So</a> I'm not quite sure the fact that we don't approve something necessarily means that we can't get something answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4738.894s">And</a> if it is, then we have to change our council rules because that, that doesn't make any sense to me that we have to approve something before we can get some answers or in order to get access that has been here.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4786.236s">It's</a> the petitioner reached out to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4788.318s">Have</a> you heard from the petitioner?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4843.246s">We</a> didn't take any vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4845.967s">How</a> do you know majority of the council was opposed to it?<h2><a href="../2016-10-27_tUX_rthPMVU/2016-10-27_tUX_rthPMVU.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 25, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=744.937s">This</a> has nothing to do with the petitioner, but more to do with BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=750.118s">And</a> you may or may not be aware, but BJ's has been a good neighbor for a number of years in that particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=758.425s">And</a> of recent, I've received a number of calls from area residents regarding the trash on the property at BJ's and how it is sneaking under the fence into surrounding neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=771.152s">And</a> I would just ask as part of this paper that we as a council send a paper to BJ's asking that they maintain the trash on both sides of the fence at BJ's and that they stay vigilant regarding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=787.202s">very</a> important neighborhood concern.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1010.817s">What</a> is the information you have to share with us, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1012.818s">I'm</a> going to share it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1014.358s">I</a> agree with Councilor Long and Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1015.999s">I</a> think it would be helpful to have that in advance of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1019.26s">So</a> then I can go over it myself and come up with some questions that I may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1025.862s">So</a> I thank the gentleman, Councilor Knight, for all the due diligence on that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1031.024s">They've</a> done a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1032.465s">But</a> in order for me to make an educated decision, I'd like to have ample time to review it ahead of time rather than right at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1038.994s">It</a> would be helpful to have a comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1040.575s">You</a> know, this rule number one, we're adding the word the and changing it to the, you know, it is difficult to follow.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1583.513s">The</a> one thing I was asked actually by phone and by email today was if I can get a resident a copy of what the proposed rule changes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1594.197s">And</a> because I don't have it electronically, it's difficult for me to relay six pages of changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1600.298s">So</a> is there any way we can get this electronically so we can get it out to our constituency? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1606.24s">I</a> believe all our documents that we get are also posted on the city's webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1612.382s">Is</a> this posted on the city webpage?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1619.087s">I'm</a> talking about the meeting notice.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1643.035s">The</a> City of Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1645.676s">I</a> couldn't find it, unless someone else is aware where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1650.337s">If</a> you could give me a heads up where it is, just so I can point people in the right direction.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1681.726s">Right,</a> and where would you find those records on the city website? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1685.068s">On</a> the council records. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1686.569s">So</a> the council records and we don't know what?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1693.568s">Can</a> you find out and send us an email just so I can point people?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2188.891s">I</a> think the woman at the podium raises some great questions, and tomorrow will be a very fruitful meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2195.076s">However,</a> I do agree that although Councilor Knight mentioned that this will allow ample opportunity to speak, the way I understand it is, other than the 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2207.005s">prior</a> meeting, that you would have to speak on something that's offered by the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2211.689s">And</a> in the past, we have allowed residents to get up and speak on any issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2215.88s">And</a> that's always been the uniqueness of our body. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2219.963s">Unlike</a> the state legislature, unlike Congress, we invite public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2225.747s">And</a> my discussion will be made tomorrow night, but I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2229.47s">I</a> will not support anything that narrows any type of public participation or makes residents jump through hurdles in order to speak before this body, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2238.036s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2241.298s">If</a> you just want to... Yes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2296.772s">Can</a> I speak once or twice? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2298.713s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2300.074s">It'd</a> be nice to get equal time. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2303.155s">It's</a> great to offer a public session prior to our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2307.457s">We're</a> opening it up at 6 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2309.558s">We</a> assume that people don't have families. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2311.399s">We</a> assume that people aren't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2313.46s">We're</a> taking a lot of assumptions here that a 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2317.322s">meeting,</a> first of all, that's not televised, and that, secondly, just say 20 people do want to come up and speak under this open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2325.679s">The</a> first person comes up and speaks on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2328.54s">The</a> second person comes up and speaks on the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2331.701s">The</a> third person comes up and speaks on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2334.621s">How</a> are we going to keep a quorum, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2337.802s">Because</a> I'm not sure what order things would be taken if people are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2342.063s">Are</a> they just going to rattle off what their concerns are and fall on deaf ears? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2346.785s">I</a> mean, to me, what better to have someone from the public speak while the debate is happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2353.632s">I</a> don't want someone speaking two hours before a debate, because that's no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2358.095s">I</a> want to hear what they have to say during the debate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2362.078s">And</a> I think we all should be eager to listen to residents that are taking the time to come up here out of their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2368.382s">We</a> always say, I wish more residents would come up, and now we're making it more difficult for residents to come up and speak before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2375.566s">So</a> that's the only point I want to make, and I appreciate you allowing me.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2499.682s">And</a> an electronic copy is already available, but we'll add that as well, amend the motion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2594.677s">Council</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2596.639s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2597.52s">This</a> is not new to the council, but I've received a number of complaints from not only area residents, but business owners that now that the daylight savings time is here, that at 5.30 it gets quite dark and square is pitch dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2615.788s">And</a> it's becoming a problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2618.089s">I</a> know roughly about 12 to 14 months ago, many of the lenses were changed within the lighting fixtures with the hopes that that would improve some of the lighting in the square that failed to yield any benefit, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2635.532s">And</a> there is a pilot program, if anyone's interested, that's being done in front of the old theater, Medford Theater on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2643.635s">You'll</a> notice that they enhanced the lights and two of the street lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2648.779s">And</a> in my opinion, they give off great light. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2651.621s">And</a> I'm hoping that we really don't need to spend much more time on this in the interest of public safety, in particular, when we have trick or treat coming in our square very shortly and in Haines Square and West Method, that these lights be changed over immediately, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2670.01s">There</a> are many sections in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2672.052s">If</a> business owners didn't leave their lights on overnight, it would be ultimately dark in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2678.296s">And</a> that's not good for business, and it's not good for public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2681.719s">So</a> I would ask for a response back from the mayor regarding when this new lighting is going to take place.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2832.378s">Mr.</a> Press, I typically don't like to bring up one street or another because I know <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2836.677s">Many</a> of our streets are in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2840.079s">But</a> I must say Riverside have, in particular at the corner of Riverside and Park and going down Riverside towards the Fellsway, there are a number of good-sized dips in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2852.346s">And</a> they're unavoidable. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2854.547s">You</a> can't swerve to one side or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2856.948s">And</a> they really cause a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2860.07s">And</a> we've asked, I know I've put it on and other members of this council have put it on a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2865.677s">Some</a> of it's due to work done by the utilities, but really the city needs to step up, find who dug these particular trenches, and get them to repave the road in the condition it previously was. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2880.929s">And</a> I would ask once again, I know we received 400,000 in safe streets grant from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2889.336s">However,</a> I don't think we can ignore the existing streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2892.939s">It's</a> great we have seven projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2894.958s">that</a> are coming to fruition, but we can't ignore the existing streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2898.861s">So</a> I would ask that Riverside Ave be looked at again by our engineer.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3060.986s">Just</a> if I could, actually the next street down and the street escapes, the name escapes me. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3068.008s">There</a> was some bushes that were eight to 10 feet tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3071.597s">En</a> a building department went out and kindly asked the owners to cut them down because it was blocking the view of people trying to get onto Riverside. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3079.559s">And</a> the residents were kind enough to get out there immediately and trim the bushes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3083.781s">I've</a> never had something of a fixed structure like a fence, but I think it's something we should ask the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3091.043s">You</a> don't happen to have a number, do you? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3093.644s">Of</a> the home that you're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3095.204s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3100.045s">So</a> if we can get that, I think we should offer for the building apartment, maybe just to go out there, take a look at the area, because that is a tough area to pull out of, let alone with an obstruction in the way, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3114.016s">On</a> that motion as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=3115.417s">Can</a> you provide that to the city clerk, the address?

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=773.272s">Just,</a> just if I could on that, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=775.695s">And</a> I appreciate the linkage committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=778.476s">A</a> lot of people might not know what the linkage committee is, but, uh, in this city, if businesses want to do a business within this community and their project, uh, is over a certain size, um, they are required to pay the city a linkage money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=793.68s">And</a> that linkage money can be used for a number of particular purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=797.261s">Uh,</a> in this case, uh, the committee, which consists of the president of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=802.258s">The</a> mayor and also the head of community development.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=820.526s">the</a> linkage money that's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=823.809s">And</a> although I'm not opposed to studies, Mr. President, I would just caution my fellow colleagues, even though it doesn't require approval from us, the previous history with studies in this community is one of three studies from 2005 to revitalize Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=849.353s">that</a> costed a couple of hundred thousand dollars for three studies to revitalize Medford Square, and we're no closer in revitalizing our square from 2005 to current. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=862.883s">Governor</a> Zav's feasibility study for the garage that fell down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=867.427s">A</a> study was done for the Governor Zav garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=870.309s">We</a> don't have a garage now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=873.133s">The</a> Mystic River Water Taxi Service, a feasibility study to study taxi service from the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=881.841s">Not</a> quite sure when it freezes over in the winter, unless they're gonna have an ice cutter in front of the taxi, how it's gonna get down the Mystic River, but that was a study that was commissioned by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=894.232s">The</a> Wellington Circle Traffic Improvement Study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=898.591s">Now,</a> anyone that's been in the city for a lot of years will realize Wellington Circle's been that way for 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=906.436s">And</a> there's been a lot of talk and discussion, a lot of lip service, but, you know, overpass, underpass, but nothing has been done to improve pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=917.383s">Take</a> it from someone that lives 30 yards from Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=921.086s">Nothing</a> has been done to improve pedestrian safety at Wellington Circle, even after the study was commissioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=928.325s">Then</a> we also had the police station feasibility study back in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=933.307s">So</a> that was three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=937.369s">Nothing</a> has been done to date with that particular study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=941.151s">I'm</a> not opposed to studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=943.032s">Studies</a> could be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=944.892s">But</a> in this case, Mr. President, I have an article from February 2015 where Chief Sacco stated on several occasions that <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=958.01s">Uh,</a> this is his quote by as early as next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=960.871s">And</a> this was again, February of 2015 by early of next year, which is January of 2016 police Sacco said the city plans to adopt a new system for residential parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=973.076s">So</a> that leads me to believe, although he's not timely, he's working on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=978.378s">And</a> that's what we've been told by the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=980.739s">Another</a> quote, the street by street enforcement as it's done now is age old. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=986.387s">Sacco</a> said during a January, Medford City Council meeting, we either will go to zone or citywide residential permits, but I don't see that happening before next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=996.596s">And</a> again, this was January, February of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=999.798s">And</a> then it goes on to say, Sacco said the traffic commission would likely meet in June to develop a new residential parking system with the intent of implementing it at the start of next year, which would be January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1015.153s">So</a> we have Chief Sacco and the Traffic Commission, by the way, which is responsible for the oversight of parking in this community, saying they're working on the issue unless they recommended that <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1030.827s">The</a> mayor commissioned a study for $20,000, which they might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1034.59s">I'm</a> not privy to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1036.412s">Why</a> would we issue a $20,000 study when we have our own traffic commission, our own chief of police looking into an issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1045.62s">And</a> why do we need to spend $20,000, Mr. President, on a report <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1052.118s">that</a> you can get three sensible people to sit around a table for two nights and figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1058.703s">I</a> don't understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1059.944s">It</a> really makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1061.745s">But</a> again, it's what this city does. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1065.117s">You</a> know, if there's an issue, commission a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1067.417s">If</a> there's an issue with the square being dead for 20 years, issue a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1071.558s">If</a> that doesn't work, issue a second one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1073.379s">If</a> that doesn't work, issue a third one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1075.379s">And</a> just keep on issuing studies, and maybe the people will forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1079.64s">So</a> I'm not sold on this $20,000, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1082.441s">I'd</a> like to hear from Chief Sacco about where he stands with permit parking in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1090.922s">And</a> I would like to hear from the Chief Law Enforcement Officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1095.163s">not</a> just from a bureaucrat saying that we need to have another study in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1102.406s">Another</a> study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1103.907s">It</a> just doesn't sit well with me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1107.688s">And,</a> you know, I'd like to hear from Jim Silva from SMARTO on the issue, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1592.801s">Just</a> if I could, um, if, if we can have the, uh, the gentleman that just spoke last, if he can leave us a list of the questions, I think those questions should be answered by the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1605.35s">So</a> if you can leave a list of the questions with the city messenger, uh, we'll make sure that it's read into the report and we get those questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1614.036s">Um,</a> also, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1616.959s">Mr.</a> Silver and his group have done a lot of work in compiling a lot of information that I believe the administration as well as Park Method should find very useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1630.738s">And</a> what better to have residents that get together <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1633.562s">with</a> a common cause and present not only a gripe, but how to resolve an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1641.251s">And</a> if you heard from Mr. Silva, he's laying out how they can resolve some of the issues that are confronting residents in particular in Salt Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1651.375s">And,</a> um, if we could, uh, by a vote of this council, uh, pass that along to the traffic commission for, uh, for their next meeting, um, that would be very helpful, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1664.727s">And</a> if we can also, um, have a park method, which Councilor Caraviello was called for a number of times now, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1672.899s">uh,</a> come to a council meeting to discuss some of the issues that we've had, uh, on the program itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1679.745s">Uh,</a> I think we should reiterate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1681.947s">So</a> if we can have, uh, everything that was stated by Jim Silver and Mr. Clark, did you get any of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1688.332s">You</a> didn't Jim, Jim, would you mind when your mind just coming up to the podium one more time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1694.378s">And,</a> um, cause I wrote down some, I don't know if I captured all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1699.082s">I</a> wrote down, uh,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1735.774s">Well,</a> that, well, that's, I don't know what his written testimony looks like, but, um, I think it's always helpful with, would it be helpful to give bullet points or the written testimony to, uh, I believe we all received an email some weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1754.781s">Did</a> you have a list of the bullet points? <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1756.702s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1757.743s">So</a> Mr. President, if we can accept the bullet points, uh, and I have the bullet points forwarded to traffic commission for review and, uh, answer the questions also that were presented, uh, regarding, um, uh, park method would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1773.432s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2122.406s">Motion</a> for approval, roll call, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3028.736s">Uh,</a> I know captain Clemente doesn't oversee the crossing guides, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3032.457s">You</a> don't oversee them.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3064.845s">Does</a> that number seem a little low, three reserves?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3067.326s">Remember</a> in previous years we used to have maybe a dozen.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3089.887s">So</a> what happens if a police officer is acting as a crossing guy and they receive a public safety call?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3118.253s">Now</a> do our traffic supervisors have a way of communicating with the police department when they're out on the streets?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3129.202s">So</a> their own personal phone, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3133.646s">Is</a> there a reason why we don't give them some type of walkie talkie or communication directly?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3143.239s">That's</a> that's what I was told by the chief a couple of years ago that that that was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3147.287s">Well,</a> they'd look into it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3149.171s">And</a> I think at the time you were getting an upgrade on your walkie talkies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3154.035s">And</a> it was mentioned that maybe some of the older ones could be used, because I've had crossing guards come up to me and say, you know, we have cars that aren't stopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3162.662s">And</a> I'm able to get a license plate, but, you know, by the time I pull out my phone or do what I have to do, you know, it's easier just to let the car go by. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3171.188s">But</a> I think if we had quicker communication, you know, with some of these people that are disregarding kids in the crosswalk, disregarding a traffic supervisor that's out there with their hand up saying stop, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3183.377s">You</a> probably hear the stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3186.038s">I'd</a> like to see greater communication in cracking down on these people that are paying no attention to traffic supervisors.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_xPBP-EonBGI/2025-03-18_xPBP-EonBGI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 11, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=143.205s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=144.626s">I</a> was the member that called for Rule 20 last week, which allows on any spending paper that comes before the council for the first time for the paper to be laid on the table for further review. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=159.812s">And</a> as I stated last week, and I still feel strongly, Mr. President, it was back, I believe, in June of this year when the administration came before the city council <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=169.313s">requesting</a> $500,000 appropriation for the repair of sidewalks and tree stump removals, uh, throughout the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=179.936s">And,</a> uh, some four months later, uh, the bid went out and it came back at, I believe it was a 30 something thousand dollars above the $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=190.759s">It</a> was roughly around 30,000 above the 500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=191.759s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=198.224s">I'm</a> not quite sure the administration just didn't go back and request that the city receive $500,000 worth of tree stump and sidewalk rather than amending the original amount that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=213.811s">And</a> we were told last week that there's roughly about three weeks left to pour cement and <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=222.422s">So</a> I'm not quite sure what we're really gonna get right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=226.403s">So</a> I know it sounds like this needs to be done immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=229.905s">And</a> that's what we heard back in June, that the money was gonna be spent immediately to start replacing sidewalks and remove tree stumps in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=239.208s">And</a> here we are four months later, and we haven't done, at least through this appropriation, haven't done one ounce of work yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=247.471s">So</a> based on that, Mr. President, based on the money that we did receive, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=252.722s">is</a> for an emergency snowstorm that happened two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=257.584s">And</a> as we all know, in the past 14 years, 13 years, we've been in a budget deficit with the snow and ice removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=266.787s">So</a> year after year, we severely underfund snow and ice and come out in a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=272.009s">And</a> here we had money that came back because of a snowstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=276.711s">And</a> in my opinion, that money should go towards the snow and ice removal, which <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=282.68s">I</a> can guarantee it will be in the deficit this year once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=286.102s">So,</a> for those reasons, Mr. President, I cannot support this additional money here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=292.486s">And</a> I voted for the $500,000 for the original stump and sidewalk work four months ago and refused to add another penny to that at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=305.654s">And</a> I believe the appropriation should be taken from the Water and Sewer Enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=312.273s">or</a> some other account within the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=315.375s">We</a> have over $8 million in the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=319.597s">And</a> so for those reasons, Mr. President, I will not be supporting this motion tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=499.403s">If</a> we can also get an update on the cemetery board, where they stand with the mausoleum <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=506.648s">I</a> know there's been a lot of discussion and research done by the cemetery board of trustees, and I would ask if we can get it just an update to the council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1039.36s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1040.681s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn that, you know, if I were to list the top calls that I receive, I would say that pedestrian safety and speeding are in the top five as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1056.269s">And</a> it's a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1058.912s">And,</a> um, you know, I'm not happy to say that over the many years that I've been on the council, that I have seen very little progress, uh, in, uh, traffic calming approaches in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1072.983s">Although,</a> uh, recently under this new minute, uh, administration, uh, the mayor signed a complete streets, uh, program that, uh, currently, uh, there's, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1085.513s">uh,</a> a complete street stakeholders committee that was set up, uh, I guess several months back. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1091.417s">And</a> it consists of a number of department heads as well as someone from the bicycle, um, advisory committee, which I believe is Bruce Kulik and someone from walk method. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1104.885s">Uh,</a> Jack's, uh, Jeff Buxom, um, is on that committee also. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1111.1s">And</a> their mission is very similar to what I want to set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1115.603s">A</a> major difference is that I believe there should be more citizen input. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1121.947s">And</a> I believe that in addition to a member of the Bicycle Advisory Committee and Walk Method, there should be a resident from every section of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1132.033s">Because</a> who best knows their neighborhood than someone that lives in the neighborhood and experiences firsthand <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1138.594s">the</a> situations of pedestrian safety and speeding and which streets may require traffic calming approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1146.12s">So</a> my motion tonight, Mr. President, is not to replace by any means the stakeholders complete street committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1157.108s">I</a> think they're doing yeoman's work and bringing to the attention of the administration as well as the police department <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1166.591s">areas</a> that are hot spots in this community that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1171.093s">With</a> that being said, I believe there was 70 locations that this complete street committee sat down and looked at a number of spots throughout the community and said, you know, if we had a wish list, what needs to be attended to in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1187.699s">And</a> they came out with 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1188.96s">In</a> my discussions with Jeff, I'd say <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1192.613s">I</a> said to Jeff, Jeff, I could probably come up with 170. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1195.035s">And</a> he says, I agree, but it's a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1199.418s">And</a> I think it's a great starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1202.259s">What</a> I'm hoping by this resolution tonight is to draw attention once again to public safety concerns in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1211.526s">And</a> I attended last Wednesday night, as well as Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Falco, the police department's public safety meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1222.887s">which,</a> due to Councilor Falco, is being held in neighborhoods throughout this community, and it was very well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1231.03s">I</a> have to thank the chief, the officers that attended, as well as Councilor Falco for bringing up this very important issue and bringing it out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1242.115s">But</a> the Brooks School, as we know, is on a state highway, and that particular road <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1250.796s">has</a> been a concern for a number of years because the only true set of working lights from the square on down to West Medford Square is, I believe, in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1262.562s">There's</a> a blinking set of lights at Pedestrian Operated in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1268.685s">Joe's</a> Church, but there is no other light all the way down past West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1275.948s">And</a> the next set of lights is <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1279.753s">I</a> believe, another pedestrian control light in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1283.136s">Raphael's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1284.718s">So</a> it's a long stretch of road that really tends to pick up speed and cars, in my opinion, see this as a place where you can pick up speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1298.29s">But</a> I wanted to throw out some of the recommendations, Mr. President, just so for the edification of the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1305.74s">things</a> that are currently being worked on at High Street in front of the Brooks School, and things that will be addressed over time because they involve more engineering study and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1321.428s">But</a> the installation of two rectangular rapid flash beacons to be actuated by push button, the beacons have been audited and expect them to arrive this coming week. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1334.08s">So</a> that should be installed very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1339.044s">They're</a> also talking about shortening the crossing using painted curb extensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1344.208s">And</a> I think that's something that was mentioned at the council meeting a few weeks ago when residents and parents came from the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1352.254s">They're</a> going to install a flexible pedestrian yield stop sign in the center of the crosswalk, along with striping to further narrow the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1360.86s">They're</a> going to paint stripes to delineate the parking lanes <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1363.881s">on</a> both sides serving to narrow the road and slow traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1367.722s">And</a> they're going to clarify much of the existing signage in the area to help with traffic control and pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1380.965s">One</a> of the major recommendations that was made was to lower the speed limit on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1386.747s">And</a> I realize because it's a state road, and I think at the meeting that was brought up at the Brooks School, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1392.102s">is</a> the fact that it's a state road that we need the Department of Transportation to act on this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1398.084s">It's</a> not something we can do internally through our own traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1401.885s">So</a> it's my understanding that is in the works to lower the speed limit to 25 miles an hour, and with the hopes that if you lower speed, streets become safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1415.269s">And,</a> you know, it's been said here a thousand times, you can have all the signage, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1420.707s">You</a> can have all the traffic markings without enforcement, without strict, consistent enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1429.211s">We're</a> not going to move forward no matter what signage we put out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1433.313s">And</a> I was a little dismayed to hear from the chief that when residents were concerned for the lack of enforcement, that the chief over and over again said, well, if I had a full complement of police officers, I'd be able to do some of the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1450.073s">And</a> I can't see why, Mr. President, with the existing amount of manpower that we have in this community, that we can't provide basic enforcement from our current staffing as it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1465.146s">And</a> in my opinion, it's a matter of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1467.928s">If</a> pedestrian safety and taking back our streets is a priority in this community, the police department will find the manpower to accommodate that task. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1478.483s">You</a> know, it was also mentioned that the Traffic Division only has four personnel right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1485.364s">There</a> are four officers in the Traffic Division. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1488.545s">And,</a> you know, to cover — don't forget, we're not open nine to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1493.066s">We're</a> open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1497.007s">And</a> it requires a significant input of manpower, not only by the patrol, but also by a Traffic Division. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1505.929s">And,</a> in my opinion, we lack <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1508.662s">the</a> proper personnel to provide the safety that's needed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1514.484s">And</a> again, I would say that's a matter of priorities and shifting of personnel to accomplish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1522.047s">During</a> the budget, the chief asked, as one request, he asked for CAAS, which I'm hoping are going to come to fruition, which in the capital improvement plan the mayor is going to be offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1533.792s">But</a> he also asked for some additional civilian manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1537.496s">And</a> part of that was to keep crime statistics in the city and also do some basic reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1546.097s">Because</a> if you go onto the police website, it's very difficult to get any information on any type of reporting that's been done regarding analysis, crime analysis, pedestrian safety, accidents within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1563.76s">And</a> the chief asked for that particular position <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1567.415s">and</a> it was denied by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1569.956s">But</a> I can tell you firsthand, without the proper reporting, because there were a lot of questions asked Wednesday night regarding how many accidents, where are these accidents located? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1580.92s">Are</a> they in this particular area or are they around the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1584.782s">And</a> we did get some information, but it was very limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1589.203s">And</a> I think a position of that would pay for itself 10 times over. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1594.346s">in</a> regards to a sense of confidence, a sense of peace of mind that it is being looked at, and that problem areas are being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1605.93s">If</a> you don't know where the problem areas are, then you can't address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1609.511s">So</a> the first step is to identify and isolate the areas that need to be attended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1615.673s">And</a> without someone that's gathering this data, I think it makes it that much more difficult for our police department to do its <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1623.968s">job.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1626.449s">Then</a> there was talk also about quicker response time when it comes to a neighborhood safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1635.152s">The</a> Brooks Hobbs or the Brooks School, I should say, there was a quick turnaround, but I think residents expected to see a little more, a little quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1647.695s">And</a> some of the quick things that were asked for to put out as maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1652.876s">a</a> couple of those orange safety barrels on High Street just to let people know that there's something there and something impeding them coming down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1662.639s">There</a> was also talk about putting up the electronic speed sign that we have to let people know, hey, we're out here, we're present, we're looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1671.941s">Even</a> to take a couple of our cars that have been sitting behind the police station unused for a period of time, they may not be in great condition, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1680.511s">but</a> they still say Method Police on them, and they still have a set of lights on top, and you park one of those out on High Street, let me tell you, that's gonna deter people. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1688.334s">The</a> minute they see it, they're gonna slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1692.256s">So</a> these are the few quick things that could have been done, and I think residents were concerned that the response wasn't adequate enough after, first of all, the child was struck on High Street, and secondly, after the several accidents <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1709.325s">that</a> happened, car accidents, right around the perimeter of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1715.09s">There</a> was also mentioned that the lighting throughout the entire community, this is not just within the high street area, throughout our entire community is poor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1726.598s">There's</a> been upgrades to the lighting here in Medford Square, but it's been, in my opinion, not adequate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1736.676s">And</a> I know they're doing a pilot, I believe, in front of the old movie theater on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1742.578s">If</a> you go by there, I believe they've put some different type of lighting in a few of the lights out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1749.441s">And</a> they do appear to give off more light, a greater distance, but I think more needs to be done to improve lighting within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1761.523s">If</a> I could just briefly talk about the pedestrian advisory committee that maybe will roll up into the complete street committee that's already formed, or maybe it could be another committee comprised of just residents in this community that give input. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1783.011s">No</a> different from a police advisory committee that would be set up <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1790.694s">within</a> other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1792.435s">So</a> I would just ask Mr. President that, and I'm sure the mission statement from the Complete Streets is very similar, but I would ask that the mission statement consist of reviewing new projects that affect pedestrians to ensure they meet local and state design guidelines, advocating for safe access for pedestrians, supporting education, outreach, and advocacy of pedestrian issues, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1819.432s">Developing</a> policy and plans to better meet the needs of pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1823.133s">Advise</a> city staff on issues related to promoting pedestrian safety and education. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1828.234s">Promote</a> walking as the most environmentally friendly form of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1832.875s">Assist</a> the Medford Traffic Commission, Mayor, City Council, and all city departments in setting priorities for pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1840.336s">Work</a> with law enforcement and other city departments to promote enforcement and education about laws, policies, regulations pertaining to pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1849.341s">and</a> review and make recommendations on capital improvement projects to ensure that pedestrian needs and pedestrian facilities are given full attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1857.884s">So</a> like I said, I know the stakeholder committee, Complete Streets, is very similar to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1865.307s">If</a> the mayor opts not to set up a separate advisory committee, I would ask that she expand the current stakeholders Complete Street committee to include residents, preferably one <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1878.532s">from</a> every neighborhood and section of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1881.913s">Like</a> I said from the outset, what better to have the eyes and ears of someone that actually lives in a neighborhood to give direct input. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1888.977s">And</a> as far as I'm concerned, there are more than ample neighbors and residents that want to get actively involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1896.94s">I</a> receive a lot of calls from people saying, how do I get on a committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1900.402s">How</a> do I get active? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1901.979s">And</a> I'd like to see, it's great to have department heads on these committees, and that's useful because they're the ones that you want to be your advocates when they approach DOT or when they approach other agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1913.947s">But</a> it's also helpful to have residents that are driving and living in the community and walking our streets, bicycling on our streets, and walking their children to school who best know the neighborhood and what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1930.537s">I</a> would ask Mr. President that, uh, this be approved, uh, based on, uh, the need, uh, throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1937.741s">And,</a> uh, if so, if the mayor sees fit that the current advisory, uh, safe streets, uh, be included to, uh, include one resident from each neighborhood of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=1950.408s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2143.534s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. Speaker.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2146.807s">Joe,</a> just if I could, have you ever reported this to the police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2150.828s">Have</a> you ever made any C-click fix? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2153.309s">Have</a> you ever reported it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2154.049s">I</a> have, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2155.229s">And</a> what response are you receiving?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2158.75s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2159.31s">This</a> is public safety.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3416.565s">Just</a> if I could, because. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3417.425s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3418.837s">I've</a> asked for a public safety summit for the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3423.101s">And</a> we had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3424.502s">And,</a> well, we haven't had a summit that addresses the needs of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3433.77s">And</a> I still believe a public safety summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3436.132s">I</a> know Councilor Lungo said that we should have the chief and the mayor and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3442.497s">That</a> is well needed, Mr. President, and long, long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3447.1s">The</a> second point that I wanted to raise is I have a copy of Walk Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3452.102s">It's</a> September 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3453.282s">And</a> I had the opportunity to talk to a member of Walk Method, and they said back a few years ago under the McGlynn administration that the mayor gave the approval to erect pedestrian neon crossing signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3471.902s">And</a> for a period of time, we saw a few of them pop up here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3476.324s">And</a> I said, wow, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3477.444s">We</a> have some neon signs showing where Pedestrian Crossing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3481.406s">The</a> only problem is that we got maybe one-fifth of what the mayor promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3489.729s">And</a> I think what we need to do, Mr. President, is, in addition to, you know, bringing forward the public safety concerns, we also have to hold people accountable in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3501.785s">And</a> if there's a commitment from the mayor saying he's gonna install 70 sets of pedestrian crossing signs, neon crossing signs, we as a council have to hold the mayor to that commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3515.327s">And</a> the fact that a new administration comes in doesn't relieve all the commitments that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3521.608s">Those</a> are commitments that should be kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3524.329s">We</a> were promised back some four years ago when they created, after myself and many, many members of this council <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3531.41s">pushing</a> for raised crosswalks in this community as a traffic calming approach, we were promised a pilot program by Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3540.398s">He</a> said, we're going to start off with three. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3542.741s">Now,</a> was I happy with three in a city this size? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3545.103s">No,</a> but I said it's a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3547.365s">Four</a> years later, we got one out of the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3551.638s">One</a> out of the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3553.199s">I've</a> asked the administration a dozen times, this new administration, to give us a report on where we stand with the Harvard Street and the Central Ave raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3563.745s">And</a> we have yet to get a response, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3567.207s">yet</a> to get to a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3568.848s">Now,</a> I realize it wasn't this current mayor that created this pilot program, but this current mayor agrees with pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3576.61s">She</a> sent her chief of staff at last Wednesday's public safety meeting, and it seems to be a priority of this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3584.932s">And</a> a priority to me is keeping forward the commitment that was made even by a previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3592.454s">And,</a> you know, so I would ask that this paper also be amended <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3596.285s">to</a> find out, Mr. President, if we could, these are important issues, find out where the commitment stands with the mayor, with this current mayor, regarding the commitment Mayor McGlynn made with neon pedestrian crossing signs that he made to walk Medford back some years ago, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3615.783s">I</a> also would ask again for the 22nd time <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3620.825s">that</a> the current mayor give us an explanation why that the pilot program for raised crosswalks has only experienced one crosswalk on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3632.387s">In</a> my opinion, it's been effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3634.567s">It</a> needs to be painted again because you can barely see it when you're driving upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3639.348s">I</a> realize there's signs on both sides of the road, but it's not visible enough in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3645.409s">But</a> it's an effective way of slowing down traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3649.118s">And</a> I don't know why, Mr. President, we were told, well, they're doing work on Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3654.583s">So</a> as soon as that work's done — that was a year and a half ago — we'll move forward on the raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3660.028s">Then</a> we were told on Harvard Street, oh, they're working on the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3663.011s">When</a> the bridge work gets done, we'll be able to — and nothing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3667.735s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3668.135s">So,</a> you know, I'm just tired of talking about the same issue over and over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3676.597s">And</a> I'm hoping we can move forward now with this new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3679.818s">But</a> we have to tie up the ends of the last administration, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3685.3s">You</a> know, people want to give a lot of accolades, this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3688.021s">Well,</a> let's tie up what wasn't done, what wasn't completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3692.405s">And</a> pedestrian safety is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3694.647s">You</a> know, I hear time and time again, oh, God forbid, wait till a major accident happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3699.851s">I</a> don't want to tell anyone, but we've had a number of deaths on our street to date, pedestrian deaths on our street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3709.079s">Mr.</a> President, we've had <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3711.173s">bicycle</a> death on our street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3714.016s">We've</a> had a number of pedestrian accidents on our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3718.06s">So</a> the horse is already out of the barn. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3720.562s">We</a> can't say, well, wait till something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3723.165s">It's</a> happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3724.626s">It's</a> happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3726.388s">You</a> know, it's not funny when a loved one is lost, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3730.451s">We</a> had a woman that was struck and killed in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3733.253s">Joe's</a> not too long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3735.015s">It's</a> not, you know, it's a very, very serious situation here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3741.7s">And</a> that incident, Mr. President, as I explained with the poor lighting, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3746.743s">If</a> anyone's familiar, when you go by St. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3749.444s">Joseph's</a> at night out there in front of the church, it's very dark out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3755.667s">Very</a> dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3756.287s">And</a> we've asked for National Grid to go out there and create some additional lighting, but that never happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3763.77s">So,</a> I don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3766.091s">Until</a> we take control of our streets, until we demand more from our police department in regards to enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3775.458s">You</a> know, we know how to give out overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3777.6s">We</a> know how to give out details. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3780.383s">We</a> know how to give everything out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3782.285s">Let's</a> give out some public safety enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3786.71s">Let's</a> provide some enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3788.432s">You</a> know, I'll rehash it over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3790.394s">There</a> was a spotlight story on Channel 5 or 4 back some four or five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3795.8s">There</a> was a couple of spotlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3797.263s">But</a> one, they did 10 surrounding communities in this area, north of Boston, and they looked to see how many communities are writing moving infractions, speeding tickets, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3809.09s">Method</a> was last on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3811.972s">This</a> is not me saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3813.272s">This</a> was a spotlight investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3815.794s">Method</a> was last on the list, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3818.795s">So,</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn, I know you've asked for the number of tickets given, and I hope you get it someday, but in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3827.194s">Uh,</a> that number could have been given to you very easily, uh, because I don't think there's many moving violation tickets going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3835.218s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4157.763s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4158.544s">I</a> want to thank councilor Falco for offering this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4161.806s">Uh,</a> at that meeting also rep gob Ali mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4165.485s">a</a> piece of legislation that he co-sponsored, I believe, regarding having local municipalities take local control of roads, and in particular roads that may be dual jurisdiction, as Councilor Knight mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4183.472s">And</a> I guess it made it as far as the governor's desk, and the governor either vetoed it or sent it back, removing state roads from the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4196.418s">So</a> it really did nothing to accomplish what we were trying to get after. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4202.381s">But</a> needless to say, Mr. President, you know, I come from a different train of thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4208.234s">You</a> know, and I've offered resolutions like this for the last probably 10 years, that there's no reason why any road in this city — I don't care if it's state or city road, Mr. President — that when a resident comes to us and say, I have a concern of a sidewalk on this road, and the road happens to be under state jurisdiction, but we can't touch the sidewalk, we can't trim the tree, but that taxpayer is paying thousands of dollars <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4236.354s">to</a> this community and property tax, to me, is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4240.978s">It's</a> absolutely ridiculous, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4243.499s">So,</a> in my opinion, if I were chief, I'd go out, I'd take DPW, I'd change all the speeding signs on High Street to 25 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4254.668s">Knowing</a> how the state works, it'll take them about 10 years to catch up with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4259.431s">Right,</a> Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4260.672s">And</a> we'll have public safety for the next 10 years on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4264.755s">So</a> the fact that the state says, oh, don't go ahead and move forward with that, to me, public safety should supersede that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4272.08s">And</a> we're not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4272.761s">We're</a> not putting tollbooths up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4274.422s">We're</a> not putting gates up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4276.003s">We're</a> saying that we need to reduce speed based on reported data of accidents, pedestrian safety in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4284.189s">And</a> in my opinion, that should take priority and wait for the ramifications down the line with the state someday, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4292.616s">But</a> I thank Councilor Falco for offering this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4944.081s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4945.001s">I</a> think it would also be helpful to find out who has ownership of that particular rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4950.743s">I</a> know we refer to it as a Winthrop Street Rotary, but High Street runs right along it too, and if that's a state road, you know, so I would ask that we also find out <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4963.185s">uh,</a> what jurisdiction the city of method has on that complete rotary in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4967.829s">And</a> if we were going to make changes, do we need to involve D O T?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5834.721s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5835.901s">And</a> thank you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5837.602s">You</a> couldn't meet two gentler, kinder people, in my opinion, and in this day and age to celebrate 50 years of anything is an accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5847.848s">And,</a> you know, they're a great couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5850.829s">And</a> I want to wish them well and many, many more anniversaries.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5873.926s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5874.946s">They</a> have 10 more than Thomas and Mary Ann, and as I stated, Bob was a mail carrier in Arlington for a number of years, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5884.89s">just</a> a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5886.831s">And</a> Marie, if anyone remembers, worked for the Medford Transcript back some many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5892.996s">She</a> was the office manager and always a friendly face within Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5899.2s">And</a> I just want to congratulate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5900.901s">They</a> have three children, seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5906.325s">And</a> they're truly a great couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5909.907s">And</a> I know they spend a lot of time in Florida as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5913.288s">And</a> when they're back here in Method, it's great to see their face. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5916.93s">And</a> I wish them well, Mr. President, in their 60th wedding anniversary.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY/2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 4, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1303.949s">So,</a> so early June, uh, we were told as a body that we needed this money immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1309.453s">Cause</a> I remember some members of the council and you probably remember the night, uh, wanted to get a little more involved with what exactly we were going to do for this 500,000, which sidewalks were going to be replaced, how many sidewalks, how many stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1324.966s">And</a> we were told at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1326.851s">Well,</a> if you let this go on another week, uh, it's going to be a week longer before we get to the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1332.392s">And</a> here we are in October and, uh, I'm dumbfounded that the city would come before us for a half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1342.635s">And</a> you must have had a plan saying we want to accomplish this many sidewalks and this many stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1350.777s">And</a> then for the low bidder to come back at 543,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1355.332s">$43,000</a> above what the city was requesting either tells me one or two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1362.094s">That</a> your list was unrealistic, meaning the amount of money you were looking for for the type of work you wanted done could never be accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1371.636s">And</a> that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1373.156s">And</a> the second thing is that I'd like to see, and I don't know if you have a copy with you, but when we originally asked for a listing of what was going to be done, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1383.824s">and</a> I remember specifically asking you about what was the cost per panel, and you gave us a cost, I think it was kind of on a low end of it, we figured out afterwards, but I don't understand where the miscommunication is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1401.433s">If</a> you presented a list or a request for proposal, whatever went out to the bidders, and it said we want what? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1410.017s">How</a> many sidewalks done? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1412.157s">Is</a> that how it went out?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1413.758s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1414.898s">And</a> how many were asked? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1416.039s">How</a> many panels were asked?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1516.788s">I</a> understand that, and I can appreciate that, because I know for a period of time the city did not have a purchasing agent, and that was a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1527.427s">But</a> on the flip side, if the bid went out and the lowest bid came back at $543,000, why as a city couldn't you go back to the drawing table and say, you know what, rather than doing 300 panels and 40 stumps, do 270 panels and 36 stumps?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1560.896s">Because</a> we didn't have someone in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1563.278s">Well,</a> exactly.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1592.108s">I</a> think it's fair to say, as you just mentioned, we have about a three week window to pour cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1597.837s">It's</a> fair to say, I don't think we're going to be pouring much cement within that three-week window.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1639.942s">Okay,</a> so that leads to my other point then. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1645.424s">Year</a> after year since I've been on the council, and it's been a number of years, we run a deficit in the snow and ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1652.166s">I</a> mean, you can almost bet on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1654.665s">that</a> our budget does not match what we spend for snow and ice removal every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1659.929s">Now,</a> here we have some money coming back based on a particular storm that we received some funding for, and we're taking the money from snow and ice that we know that account is going to go into a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1673.858s">I</a> bet you right now that that account will be in a deficit, and we're spending it on catch basins, which we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1681.223s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1682.124s">We're</a> spending it on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1683.855s">We're</a> spending on other tree planters and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1687.997s">Why</a> wouldn't we, as a city, saying, knowing the history of this community, not funding fully the budget for snow and ice, why wouldn't we take that money and put it back in snow and ice?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1711.008s">You've</a> been around a lot of years, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1713.533s">And</a> that was the first time I've ever seen a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1716.295s">So,</a> in the 15 years I've been on the council, one year there was a surplus, 14 years we were in deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1722.84s">If</a> I was a betting man, I'd say we're probably going to be in deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1725.982s">And</a> I've been in New England a long time, as well as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1728.784s">And,</a> you know, the mild winters are few and far between. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1731.547s">So,</a> you know, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1734.088s">I</a> just, you know, I'm having deja vu again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1737.671s">I'm</a> having deja vu with the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1740.693s">You</a> know, you request a half a million dollars, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1743.813s">And</a> I've asked the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1745.174s">I</a> talked to the mayor a couple of weeks ago when she called me on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1747.955s">That</a> was the first thing I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1749.096s">I</a> said, how many sidewalks and stumps have been done with the 500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1752.638s">And</a> she said, we are in the process of awarding the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1757.12s">This</a> is months after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1759.181s">And</a> now we're coming back before the council saying, give us a little more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1763.283s">It's</a> not a lot, but give us a little more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1767.385s">I</a> really have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1769.626s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1770.167s">I'd</a> rather see this go back out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1773.178s">Or</a> I'd rather see you sit down with the low bidder and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1777.582s">And</a> I don't know if you can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1778.783s">Maybe</a> it has to go back out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1780.465s">But</a> sit down with the low bidder and say, give us $500,000 worth of sidewalks and stump removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1787.451s">That's</a> what I'd rather see done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1790.815s">The</a> second piece you mentioned about catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1794.198s">You</a> mentioned there are 4,500 catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1796.76s">And</a> I think you remember a couple of months ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1799.396s">I</a> said you can go down any street and see a sunken catch basin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1802.578s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1803.158s">That's</a> how bad it's getting in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1805.5s">You</a> provided a list to us which seems to be probably calls that were made to the mayor's office within the last year or so requesting a catch basin on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1818.868s">Do</a> we have a full list of catch basins that need repair? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1822.618s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1822.878s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1851.408s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1852.515s">And,</a> you know, and I realize you just started doing that check throughout the city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1888.5s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1889.861s">So</a> if you were going to give an estimate of how many catch basins need some type of repair, and I realize it could vary from 1,500 to 5,000, what would be your thought out of the 4,500?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1930.139s">I</a> know, but I'm not talking about being flush. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1932.58s">I</a> mean, our streets are riddled with potholes, our sidewalks are cracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1936.523s">I'm</a> talking about catch basins that when you look at, you say, wow, that catch basin is sinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1942.368s">I</a> mean, the average person looking at it could spot it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1945.049s">Not</a> talking about a lip between the street and the catch basin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1949.373s">Roughly,</a> what do you think we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1950.673s">OK,</a> at the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1953.642s">So</a> we're looking at probably 450 catch basins that need some type of repair?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1990.266s">So</a> when will this list be done?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2009.502s">So,</a> so, so we have a private contractor that's going around currently cleaning the catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2014.464s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2015.585s">Why,</a> why wouldn't we ask the private contractor as part of cleaning the basins to also provide us a list because they do this for a living, provide us a list of catch basins that currently is sinking and that needs some type of interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2033.795s">Why</a> wouldn't we take that step, even if it was an additional cost, why wouldn't we take that step to at least point out in the community, because I really believe we're at a real, real point of concern here with these catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2050.561s">And,</a> you know, if you want to talk about flooding in the community like we had in the Lawrence Estates and so forth, don't attend to your catch basins, and then you're really going to see some major flooding and flooding of basements throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2063.931s">And</a> people are going to be irate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2066.132s">And</a> I think we're at a point right now where many of our catch basins are going to collapse onto themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2072.754s">And</a> that's going to be a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2074.194s">That's</a> going to be a real major concern in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2076.435s">And</a> I don't think we're addressing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2077.695s">I'm</a> not pointing the finger at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2078.856s">You've</a> been here a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2080.896s">But</a> we're not addressing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2081.877s">We</a> have no list that we can look at, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2085.818s">You</a> can't show me a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2087.178s">It's</a> being compiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2088.579s">Well,</a> I realize that it's a work in progress, but at some point, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2093.547s">You</a> know, this is not the, we're not talking to the City of New York here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2097.708s">We're</a> talking to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2098.868s">At</a> some point, we should be able to get a number, a good number of catch basins that need to be attended to and what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2108.091s">Again,</a> we're being presented with piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2111.952s">Okay,</a> here's 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2112.572s">We</a> may or may not get to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2116.153s">That's</a> what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2117.374s">We</a> may or may not get to these.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2183.742s">So</a> why wouldn't we take advantage of some of the surplus money in the water and sewer accounts, the $8 million that we have in water and sewer? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2192.165s">Why</a> wouldn't we be looking at some of this funding to start replacing catch basins and doing some of the work we'd need throughout the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2204.971s">I</a> realize that, but I think as long as this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2208.215s">keeps</a> approving anything that's presented to us, I think we're going to be faced with this piecemeal approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2215.901s">And</a> again, Brian, this is not directed at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2219.103s">I'm</a> just tired of a piecemeal approach to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2223.226s">And</a> that seems to be, again, what we're facing here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2227.109s">And</a> I, as one member, am not going to support this tonight because I think, as I stated last week when we were talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2236.56s">the</a> capital plan that we wanted for this community and the mayor presented the Plan for City Hall here with nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2245.563s">It</a> was this council that stood up and said madam mayor We want the capital plan before we move forward and sure enough the committee the whole meeting last Wednesday the mayor presented her draft capital plan and You know again, I would ask my colleagues that we either <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2266.482s">table</a> this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2268.403s">I</a> know there might be some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2269.783s">I'm</a> just throwing this out there that we table this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2272.964s">Uh,</a> so we can have a full discussion with the mayor because Brian's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2277.866s">He's</a> doing yeoman's work, but I want to know the direction we're going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2281.868s">And</a> I don't think doing piecemeal, uh, 24 catch basins here, a few sidewalks here, uh, is adequate enough for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2291.251s">And</a> maybe when we talk about capital planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2294.744s">that</a> that should be mixed in with the capital planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2297.245s">What</a> is the five-year plan for our streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2300.267s">What</a> is the five? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2301.147s">Councilor</a> Knight brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2302.708s">He</a> brought up about x-raying our streets so we can get on top of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2306.73s">And</a> here we are tonight, really, with a Band-Aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2309.532s">This</a> is a Band-Aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2311.553s">And</a> you know what happens when you pull off a Band-Aid? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2314.995s">You</a> get an ouch. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2316.715s">And</a> we've received a lot of ouches in the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2320.638s">And,</a> Mr. President, I would respectfully ask <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2324.008s">that</a> this be sent to a committee of the whole meeting where we can invite the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2329.59s">It</a> was great to have the mayor here last week to discuss some of the issues going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2335.552s">And</a> so we can address the catch basins, the sidewalks, tree stumps, signage, whatever else you want to address as either part of the capital plan, either part of the surplus money we have in the water and sewer account over $8 million <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2354.456s">of</a> ratepayer money sitting there for these type of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2358.959s">That</a> money's there for infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2363.582s">It's</a> not there for a barn rating so they can say, oh, look at our barn rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2367.665s">We</a> have a great barn rating because we have all the surplus money lying around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2371.587s">No,</a> it's for infrastructure improvements in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2375.51s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that this be sent to a committee of the whole meeting for a further review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2383.257s">And</a> I thank Mr. Kearns.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2421.663s">I</a> didn't motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2424.045s">I</a> was trying to be magnanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2425.906s">But</a> apparently, if you want to make that a B paper, I will have to draw a motion to table.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2442.907s">It's</a> your opinion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3975.885s">Just</a> a quick thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3979.007s">This</a> council took a vote during budget season to have poll workers fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3986.033s">I</a> realize that it didn't happen at the previous election, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3990.438s">I'm</a> going to ask that the clerk feed the poll workers, Mr. President, based on a vote of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3997.061s">Mr.</a> Finn, does that look doable based on?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4034.994s">I</a> know, but you just said you might not be able to pull it off.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4059.228s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4060.388s">We</a> could probably stagger it a little bit.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4920.207s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4921.327s">And,</a> uh, I had, uh, Mr. English, uh, my junior and senior year at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4928.91s">And</a> I can tell you that, uh, typically, uh, phys ed was the type of, uh, class that you'd skip one here, there, but not with Mr. English. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4940.454s">Mr.</a> English did not put up with any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4943.295s">And,</a> uh, he was a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4944.755s">I</a> got to know him well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4946.636s">And,</a> uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4948.27s">He</a> will be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4951.233s">Please</a> rise for a moment of silence.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5188.641s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5189.881s">It</a> was about three years ago I was contacted by a number of business owners at that stretch of Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5198.203s">Anyone</a> familiar with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5199.363s">There</a> used to be a bus stop that stretched about six car lengths in front of the businesses, and it took up a majority of the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5209.565s">We</a> got together with the T, along with the business owners, and we narrowed the space where the bus can stop to pick up some additional spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5218.057s">Just</a> recently, a car knocked down the bus sign that was erected on a single pole, and the T erected the sign back at the old location. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5230.845s">So</a> it took us almost two years to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5233.547s">We're</a> back at step one again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5235.308s">So</a> I would ask that the T look at their records, Mr. President, and relocate the bus stop sign in front of 213A <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5245.398s">Middlesex</a> ave where it was voted on and approved for relocation back some two or three years ago.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5265.156s">I</a> haven't had much success with them but if that's where it goes, that's where it goes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5270.804s">Do</a> we have a representative? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5272.265s">Do</a> we have a representative to the T point of information council Scott?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5286.955s">So</a> maybe, maybe if we could send it to him as well, CC it to Dan.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_L5Dn-1_BzKM/2025-03-18_L5Dn-1_BzKM.html">Medford, MA City Council - Sep. 20, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=84.222s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=88.461s">It's</a> my honor and pleasure, Mr. President, tonight to recognize a young gentleman in our community who has put in countless hours to rise to the top of being a Boy Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=105.872s">And</a> anyone that's been in the Scouts realizes that you go through different levels to attain the highest level, which is Eagle Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=114.798s">And</a> it's many countless hours of <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=117.91s">community</a> participation, it's many countless hours of obtaining badges, field trips, and then leadership within the scouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=127.26s">And</a> here we have a young gentleman in pack 416. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=133.546s">And</a> that's the Otis Street Church, United Methodist Church, that sponsors the PAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=140.449s">And</a> over the last, let's say, three or four years, I've had the privilege of recognizing many Eagle Scout recipients. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=151.134s">from</a> the Otis Street Pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=154.575s">And</a> they've done yeoman's work in representing our community and putting out young gentlemen of Andrew's caliber within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=164.818s">Just</a> a few things I'd like to state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=166.938s">Andrew</a> earned 28 merit badges, 21 of which were Eagle required. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=174.26s">He</a> had various positions in the troop, including patrol leader, assistant senior patrol leader, and senior patrol leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=183.108s">As</a> part of the Eagle Scout, every Eagle Scout is required to submit a community service project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=192.336s">And</a> we've had a number of Eagle Scouts within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=196.079s">The</a> last one I recall was an Eagle Scout that fixed the flagpole when it came down during a hurricane, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=202.52s">in</a> front of the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=204.541s">And</a> he did a fundraiser and raised funds and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=207.842s">And</a> he also put some shrubbery and bushes around that and erected our flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=212.243s">And</a> Andrew came up with a great concept as part of his project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=218.225s">I'd</a> like for him to say a few words on the project itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=223.626s">And</a> you know, most of the times I ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=227.253s">people,</a> would you like to come up and say a word or two? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=229.795s">And</a> Andrew, without hesitation, said, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=233.618s">So</a> he must be a gifted speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=235.46s">Uh-oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=237.902s">I</a> set the table for you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=240.564s">So</a> Andrew would like to say a few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=243.286s">One</a> other point I'd like to mention is when you look at Eagle Scout, it's not just the scout that's going through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=251.013s">It's</a> the mom and dad, which we have in the audience tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=254.055s">that,</a> as they could probably attest to, spend many countless hours on these projects and chaperoning the scout around and so forth, and they participate as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=264.749s">But</a> an interesting fact is only about 5% of all Boy Scouts <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=269.735s">attain</a> the rank of Eagle Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=273.137s">And</a> since 1912, when this was established, there has been 1,700,000 Boy Scouts that have earned the rank of Eagle Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=288.967s">That</a> may sound like a lot, but we're talking over 100 years worth of millions of Boy Scouts, hundreds of millions of Boy Scouts throughout this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=299.97s">And</a> it's really, truly a big honor to obtain this level. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=304.611s">So</a> at this point, I'd like to pass it over to Andrew so he can explain his community service project.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=436.431s">So</a> as we can see, Andrew will be in good company. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=440.053s">Eagle</a> Scouts, Neil Armstrong, Michael Bloomberg, Method Man, Stephen Breyer, Judge Breyer, President Gerald Ford, Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State, Steven Spielberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=454.723s">So</a> you're in a real elite group, Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=458.225s">And</a> at this time, I'd just like to present the Method City Council accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=462.986s">says</a> the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Andrew Knight, Eagle Scout, Court of Honor Troop 416, on attaining this high ranking within scouting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=473.589s">The</a> realization of this outstanding achievement will undoubtedly lead to success and accomplishments throughout your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=480.651s">Signed</a> by Council President Frederick Dello Russo and myself, City Council, Michael Marks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=493.064s">If</a> we could take a picture out here, that'd be great.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1201.823s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1203.624s">I</a> think there was a number of good suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1205.365s">Often,</a> um, there was a pilot program created, uh, I believe it was about three years ago at a request of this council, uh, to implement raised crosswalks throughout the community and other, uh, communities have been very successful, uh, in using raised crosswalks as a traffic calming approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1225.396s">Um,</a> and, uh, to date we've had one raised crosswalk, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1230.532s">uh,</a> which was implemented on Winthrop street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1233.935s">And</a> we're still waiting for the other two as part of the pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1238.839s">And</a> I've asked the administration a dozen times and we have yet to get a response on, uh, when the other two race crosswalks will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1247.926s">But,</a> uh, this is not rocket science and you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1253.185s">in</a> particular around schools, around senior buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1257.047s">There</a> are many methods that you can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1259.888s">Many</a> communities widen the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1262.529s">And</a> when you widen your sidewalks, it slows down traffic because you don't have, as we all know, High Street is two lanes, but they're very wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1272.034s">And</a> it lends itself for cars to pick up speed in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1277.956s">There's</a> also markings you can put on the road <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1280.468s">that</a> when cars approach they appear to be, they're 3D in nature, and they appear to be some type of obstruction in the roadway, and cars tend to slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1291.473s">So</a> you have raised crosswalks, you have these 3D images in the road, you can widen sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1297.535s">There's</a> a number of approaches that we can take, in particular around school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1301.882s">zones</a> to make sure that our children are safe when crossing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1306.426s">It's</a> far easier to cross a road that's maybe 25 feet in length or width rather than 45 feet in width. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1315.113s">And</a> these are the things that really we need to move forward on as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1321.178s">And</a> we're finding it difficult to get the administration to just paint crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1326.662s">And</a> that's another issue that's going to be brought up, uh, tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1329.504s">But,</a> uh, here we are in September and we still haven't painted all our crosswalks throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1336.35s">These</a> are just basic, basic, uh, public safety, uh, um, initiatives that could take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1343.295s">I</a> agree with councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1344.536s">I</a> think, uh, that we do need to hire, uh, an engineer, a traffic engineer, uh, within the office of community development and a city this size, uh, with the number of streets we have, the number of intersections, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1356.585s">I</a> think it's only appropriate in that we can't rely on the traffic commission to solve all our woes, but we can take some small initiatives to make our streets safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1368.587s">I've</a> been saying for years, we have to take our roads back. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1371.348s">We're</a> at a point right now, people don't want to go out and do a power walk because they're afraid to be on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1378.089s">They're</a> afraid when they get to an intersection that they have to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1381.67s">And</a> really, our city should be much more user-friendly when it comes to pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1387.754s">So</a> I would also add, Mr. President, that a raised crosswalk at that particular area would be reviewed by the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1396.8s">You</a> know, a set of lights is great there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1400.662s">But</a> I think we have to look at a number of options that we can explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1408.554s">I</a> think a raised crosswalk is very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1410.696s">I</a> know on Winthrop Street it has done a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1413.579s">If</a> you talk to area residents, at first they heard a lot of banging of the undercarriage of cars because people didn't recognize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1421.086s">And</a> even with the neon signs on both sides of <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1423.525s">the</a> road, but now people do, if you stand out there and watch, people do slow down when they come to that raised crosswalk on Withrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1433.248s">So</a> that would be my suggestion, Mr. President, that these issues be looked at immediately in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5047.656s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5048.837s">I</a> think all of us behind this reeling realized the need for repairs to this particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5055.16s">And,</a> uh, I know councilor Scarpelli brought up an issue that's near and dear to me about the, uh, which I refer to him as prison restrooms we have, uh, within this building here that are in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5067.546s">So</a> I too would like to see a total plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5071.557s">And</a> I was under the impression after budget deliberations that we were gonna be seeing the mayor's capital improvement plan sometime in September and October. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5081.0s">And</a> to me, that would give me a better vision of what the future's gonna bring, rather than having it come before us piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5088.243s">We</a> all realize the parapet and the exterior of the building is in tough condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5094.765s">I</a> remember some years back, and some of the councilors were on at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5099.375s">that</a> any spending paper that was before this council, we voted as a council to have it appear, not the first time on the council floor, but at a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5110.253s">So</a> we can sit down with the department heads, we can sit down with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5113.708s">and</a> discuss the need for the spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5116.77s">And</a> I don't know why we got away from that, but now we're seeing multimillion dollar items appear on the council floor for the first time without any committee of the whole meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5127.416s">And,</a> uh, you know, I, I prefer, uh, the ladder. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5131.118s">I</a> prefer committee of the whole meetings, uh, and, uh, discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5135.701s">You</a> know, we received a paper stating what's gonna be done, and the paper we received from the mayor's office, it goes on to say phase two will be a bid in the spring for internal work in the council chambers, external work such as front entrance doors, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5154.576s">Now,</a> if I was gonna do work in my house, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5157.459s">And</a> I went to the contractor and said, what are you going to do for this $50,000 I've given you? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5163.72s">And</a> he says, well, I'm going to replace your windows, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5167.961s">I'd</a> say, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5168.741s">No,</a> what does et cetera mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5170.442s">What's</a> actually involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5172.302s">What</a> are we getting for our dollar? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5173.982s">So</a> I think this needs to be vetted personally, Mr. President, and the committee, the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5181.624s">I</a> don't think anyone behind this reel doesn't think this is well overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5187.33s">As</a> we know, the city for many years neglected its buildings and its infrastructure without having proper maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5194.733s">So</a> I would just respectfully ask that this be laid on the table until we have a Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5202.457s">Mr.</a> President, I'm sure you can set that up next week and we can discuss this further, as well as any other capital improvements we heard about the woman's locker room at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5215.242s">I</a> heard about that a dozen times. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5217.125s">I've</a> yet to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5218.107s">That's</a> a cost of the estimates that I've heard, half a million dollars to add a woman locker room. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5225.776s">in</a> the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5226.816s">There's</a> a number of issues that we were told during budget that don't worry about them during budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5232.077s">It's</a> going to be part of the mayor's capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5234.658s">So</a> I think we really need to sit down, Mr. President, as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5238.859s">You</a> know, I've been around for a little while, and I refuse to get things piecemeal like the city worked for many, many years under the past administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5247.941s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate that we're the stewards of the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5255.034s">And</a> it's an easy fix just to approve everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5257.836s">But</a> I think we have to do our homework and our due diligence on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5261.558s">And,</a> uh, I don't think it hurts anyone to have a committee, the whole meeting on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5267.922s">Yes,</a> it would be a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5268.883s">Mr.</a> President, motion to table matter is tabled committee, the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5276.868s">That</a> was part of the motion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5875.492s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5875.913s">And</a> I don't want to put my colleague Councilor Caraviello on the spot, but where he sits on the, um, uh, committee on the public library for the rehab of the public library, uh, in the best case scenario, if we were to get the grant money from the state after filing the application, are we looking at two years out before we possibly could get some funding and start <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5901.528s">looking</a> at an addition? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5902.529s">Are</a> we looking at three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5903.909s">Are</a> we?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5990.338s">So,</a> uh, Mr. Moki, it was about, uh, I don't know, maybe four months ago that, uh, there was an appropriation made, uh, for some repairs to the library roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6002.388s">They</a> did some repointing, uh, around the top of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6005.871s">Uh,</a> a major concern was the fact that no one was cleaning the drains. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6011.436s">So</a> we didn't have a lot of places where water was actually infiltrating through the roof, but people weren't cleaning the drains out in the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6019.009s">that</a> was creating pooling up there, and then water will find its way, you know, eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6024.773s">So,</a> and that was a major repair from what I remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6028.716s">The</a> dollar amount was far less than $35,000 to $45,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6033.12s">Over</a> the last four or five months, what have we found? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6037.303s">Because</a> we were told that they were going to fix the roof, not a complete roof because there were three options at the time, but fix the roof to stop the leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6046.79s">And</a> I thought we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6048.531s">And</a> now you're saying that we're at $35,000 to $45,000 to
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6152.885s">I,</a> you know, I, I agree with some of the comments in what council Longo said. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6156.407s">Um,</a> and I, and I think a meeting's definitely needed for this particular building because it's a much larger scope and the project's much larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6165.051s">Uh,</a> but the library roof has been a bone of contention for a period of time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6169.934s">Uh,</a> it's heavily used by our youngsters and residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6174.796s">And</a> I think to at least give me a peace of mind and people working in the library and people that go, uh, frequent the library, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6182.684s">I</a> think it's a small amount to share up that particular roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6186.346s">So</a> I would support this tonight, knowing that the study was done in August and that, you know, no matter what takes place with the building, we need to do something now, because I agree with you that we can't plan on a mild winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6201.933s">I</a> think, you know, we have to plan for the worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6204.314s">And</a> so I would support this tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6302.889s">We</a> had our first annual fundraiser for our dog park event this Sunday.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6320.636s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, for those at home that didn't hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6323.517s">We</a> had our first annual fundraiser for our dog park that's going to go on Riverbend, hopefully next year, behind the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6331.781s">And</a> we had a fundraiser this Sunday, 11 to 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6335.443s">There</a> were a number of volunteers that came to the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6340.766s">It</a> was well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6341.986s">We</a> probably washed anywhere from 70 to 85 dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6346.408s">And</a> let me tell you, if you haven't washed a dog, it's a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6350.643s">It's</a> a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6352.465s">I</a> want to thank the organizers, Mr. President, that have been with moving this dog park forward for the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6359.513s">Patty</a> Flynn, Jim Silva, Gary DeStefano, and Diane Gintner, the chicken and rice guys, sponsored the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6367.583s">So</a> you came up, you got your dog wash, you got a plate of chicken and rice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6370.839s">We</a> had a pet photographer there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6373.119s">I</a> want to thank the administration, the mayor's office for allowing us to use City Hall and allowing us for the event to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6384.402s">And</a> again, I want to thank all the volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6387.662s">It</a> was a very successful event. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6389.063s">We</a> hope to have more events and hopefully this will lead to first dog park in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6395.704s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6654.464s">Councilor</a> Markswell? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6658.145s">I</a> would evoke rule 20 section four, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6662.327s">Uh,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7154.513s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7155.814s">Uh,</a> the, uh, bus stop at the corner of, uh, main and high street was temporarily closed due to the, uh, construction of the credit bridge from August 31st to September 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7170.463s">And,</a> um, I was contacted by a property owner in that direct area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7176.687s">And</a> they said if they can close it for two weeks to help, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7179.577s">with</a> construction, why can't we leave it closed until the construction's over? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7185.022s">And</a> it made sense to me, Mr. President, that anything we can do to help the business area would be beneficial to not only the businesses, but also to the residents that traverse that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7198.875s">So</a> I would ask that the temporary closing, which took place August 31st to September 14th, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7206.789s">remain</a> in effect until the Craddock Bridge is fully operational, Mr. President, and then we can revert back to a stop being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7217.515s">We</a> received a report from MassDOT through Councilor Scarpelli's due diligence of several bus stops that we requested to be moved, and that does have a high ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7231.602s">I</a> can appreciate that they're saying it services approximately 600 passengers a day on a number of bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7239.629s">And</a> so I know that's a heavy traveled area, but I would say that in due deference to the businesses in that particular location, that this be taken under advisement, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7397.596s">It's</a> currently working now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7927.999s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7929.14s">And</a> yes, uh, console nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7930.76s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7931.54s">I</a> think it was about seven or eight months ago when console Caraviello offered his resolution about, uh, finding owners that leave graffiti up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7940.863s">And,</a> uh, you know, I, I don't have a problem if, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7943.991s">The</a> city approaches a business, and in this case, it could be a homeowner too, because we're saying business could be a homeowner, and after many attempts, the homeowner of the business says, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7955.077s">I'm</a> not going to clean that off. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7956.618s">Then</a> I think there should be teeth that you can go after the business or the homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7960.58s">The</a> concern I have is I, as a homeowner, someone comes up Halloween night and spray paints the front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7968.257s">Whatever</a> the ordinance reads, within 10 days, 14 days, I have to remove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7972.203s">That</a> adds insult to injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7974.005s">So</a> I just got my house spray painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7977.33s">It's</a> probably going to cost me hundreds of dollars, if not $1,000 or $2,000 to remove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7983.419s">And</a> then I have the city saying, if you don't remove it within X number of days, we're going to fine you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7988.405s">I</a> think it's, you know, it's a little too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7991.928s">I</a> could see people that are leaving it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7993.81s">You</a> know, the business that we refer to on Forest Street, that was cleaned off a number of times, and the tagging went back a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8003.164s">So</a> it wasn't, you know, there may be some new stuff or some older stuff still up there, but I think we have to be very careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8010.187s">The</a> City of Somerville has a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8013.588s">First</a> of all, on their website, they have a place where you can report graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8018.77s">Secondly,</a> they have, what Councilor Knight was saying, they have an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8022.811s">It's</a> called Removal of Graffiti Agreement and Release of Liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8027.225s">They</a> will go to anyone's home, they will go to any business, if the business owner signs the liability form, and Councilor Scarpelli can probably speak better than this than I can, and the liability form waives any type of liability that the city of Somerville may have in the process of cleaning this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8046.91s">But</a> it's a great alternative to offer to people that were just wronged. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8051.031s">You</a> know, most people, you know, don't ask to get their house graffitied or their garage graffitied or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8057.432s">this</a> is something that's done by vandals. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8059.953s">And</a> I think to offer a service is a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8065.215s">And</a> if you offer a service and someone doesn't want to take you up on it, then maybe we should have teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8070.376s">We</a> also have a clean it or lean it ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8072.777s">And</a> the clean it or lean it ordinance, in my opinion, would apply to graffiti also. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8077.099s">And</a> that calls for a penalty. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8078.62s">So</a> I believe we can enforce the clean it or lean it on graffiti if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8084.563s">You</a> know, this city is very lax when it comes to any type of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8090.266s">But</a> I like what Somerville does. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8092.527s">I</a> think this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8093.827s">I</a> just don't want to penalize business owners or <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8097.789s">residents</a> that may have been tagged and saying, well, you better get that off or we're not going to only tag you, we're going to send you a bill on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8106.531s">So</a> I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8107.892s">But</a> I think we can craft something that makes sense and possibly look at, like Councilor Knight mentioned, about having <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8116.012s">you</a> know, a dedicated office that will go out and do some graffiti removal in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8123.093s">I</a> had someone drop off today to my house because they saw this on the agenda, a bottle. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8130.455s">Actually,</a> I'm glad they didn't put it in a briefcase or some other bag because it dropped off a bottle of, it's called clarinet. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8142.865s">And</a> this is a substance that a lot of municipalities use. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8146.848s">You</a> spray it on any new cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8148.73s">So</a> when we did the Fast 14 project, you spray it on the cement that's holding up the bridges, and it makes it 100 times easier to remove graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8160.88s">And</a> it's really, it's a cost-effective way of, at least the city doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8165.004s">I</a> wouldn't recommend people spraying their homes with this, but I think it's an effective way for municipalities <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8171.732s">and</a> in locations that are prone to, to, uh, graffiti, uh, to use this substance, uh, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8178.858s">And,</a> uh, there's a lengthy, um, uh, material safety data sheet that came with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8185.403s">And</a> if the city administration is interested, I'd be more than happy to pass this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8191.248s">Uh,</a> I won't leave it at city hall because I don't want them thinking I'm leaving something around that, uh, could be construed as something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8198.934s">But,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8200.975s">I</a> agree with this resolution, and I thank my council colleague for offering it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9084.832s">I</a> brought this issue up several months back regarding the outstanding <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9091.223s">number</a> of renewals that were out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9094.926s">So</a> you said there's roughly 90?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9108.157s">And</a> that runs by calendar year, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9110.139s">That's</a> by calendar year, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9111.4s">So</a> from January to present, we were able to do what, a little over 100?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9122.289s">And</a> prior to that, we had multiple food inspectors?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9136.837s">So</a> just fill me in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9138.978s">When</a> one of your inspectors go out and do an inspection, it's a thorough inspection of the premises, the kitchen, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9147.171s">and</a> so forth.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9192.956s">So</a> the number outstanding now, is it a combination of all those different? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9196.338s">It's</a> a combination of all of those, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9198.62s">And</a> what do we say to consumers that are going out into these establishments that haven't been inspected? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9204.964s">Good</a> question.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9261.53s">So,</a> so, uh, on the council agenda tonight, we're looking to implement a food trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9266.572s">which</a> is gonna add possibly another 20, 30, 40 different trucks throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9272.717s">Right</a> now, you don't even have the capability of completing what we have currently in the brick and mortar establishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9279.923s">Was</a> there a recommendation to add a staff person to your office?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9297.95s">And</a> what is the fee to a business for the inspection?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9312.322s">So</a> if you go out, do you prorate it? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9314.884s">If</a> you're there six months late, do you prorate the fee?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9324.712s">But</a> you get a permit based on the inspection, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9332.826s">Right,</a> but ideally it's supposed to happen pretty close to each other, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9338.388s">So</a> we're charging business owners that are six months into their year a permit that wasn't really inspected. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9346.19s">I</a> mean, the city of Medford didn't give a proper inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9350.491s">Do</a> you see a problem with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9352.032s">Absolutely,</a> I do, yes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9359.224s">I've</a> never seen it this bad, to be quite honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9361.864s">I've</a> been around the council a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9363.565s">I've</a> never seen it this bad.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9370.607s">So</a> I've had business owners contact me and say it's been five months, I don't have my permit yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9376.509s">Do</a> you have people reaching? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9377.429s">They</a> don't have their permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9379.33s">Their</a> inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9380.965s">Do</a> you have people, the inspection's a separate certificate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9385.608s">Right,</a> and most people put that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9386.849s">You're</a> required to put it up, aren't you?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9388.711s">Right,</a> so have you had business owners reach out to you and say, hey, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9392.954s">I'm</a> worried that I'm not in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9396.396s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9397.397s">So</a> they just call the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9398.478s">They</a> don't call the Board of Health?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9405.622s">No,</a> we have people that are concerned that have been around a long time know that there's inspections that take place and the city is nowhere to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9415.106s">You</a> know, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9416.886s">It's</a> a big concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9418.627s">Why</a> can't we bring on a temporary food inspector to assist in this rather than saying, well, it might be another two months because too much, you know, is three months, four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9428.651s">Then</a> it gets around the holidays and doesn't move as quick.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9435.32s">Mr.</a> President, I'd ask that we make a recommendation as a council on behalf of not only the businesses, but every resident in this community that frequents a restaurant in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9446.048s">I</a> would hope that, uh, you know, the board of health's doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9449.471s">Uh,</a> and, and here we go tonight, uh, saying that we may introduce food trucks in the community, which requires the same scrutiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9459.338s">Um,</a> we don't have the manpower to cover what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9462.64s">So</a> I would ask that the administration, Mr. President, we saw in the papers tonight we have $8 million in surplus money that they hire a temporary food enforcement officer to assist the Board of Health until we can get this number down to where it should be, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9551.947s">Get</a> a current listing with the outstanding permit, whether it's permit 1, 2, 3 that you were describing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9559.171s">And</a> this wasn't reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9560.772s">I</a> realize you've only been here four weeks, but there's a frustration that's been going on for a lot of months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9565.894s">And</a> I understand.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9570.797s">These</a> are important issues.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9576.14s">The</a> type of outstanding that the business itself won the last time it was inspected. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9580.802s">And</a> you have just paper reporting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9603.718s">Right,</a> and plus you're gonna be getting voicemail pretty soon, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9606.36s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9607.12s">So</a> that's something brand new. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9609.762s">Voicemail</a> just came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9611.643s">And</a> you're gonna be getting that at City Hall, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9613.464s">So</a> when you're updating the paper files, you can have your voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9616.446s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=9617.067s">Yeah,</a> we're moving forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10409.767s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I just want to echo the comments that Councilor Scarpelli just stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10416.73s">I</a> think it was Councilor Scarpelli several months back that asked for a moratorium that it be looked at, and the Metropolitan Planning Board, I think, is a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10429.575s">I</a> know Councilor Falco mentioned about possibly bringing on a consultant, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10433.937s">I</a> think the Metropolitan Planning Board can at least assist us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10437.82s">And</a> one of the most important functions of this council is zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10442.283s">And</a> zoning is the lifeblood of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10445.585s">So</a> we could talk about what the city is going to look like, the future, this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10449.955s">It's</a> the zoning that lays the foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10452.678s">So</a> it's really this council that needs to sit down, sit down with the Metropolitan Planning Board, maybe a consultant, whoever it might be, and start the process of reviewing our zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10465.65s">You</a> can go up and down Salem Street, for instance, and there may be seven different zoning districts on Salem Street alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10473.256s">So</a> these are the things I think that we as a council have to say, okay, we want to know what the direction's going to be, but we also have to lay out a framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10484.104s">We</a> have to lay out a framework by the Meadow Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10486.846s">Is</a> it housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10487.987s">Is</a> it commercial? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10489.348s">What</a> is industrial what what what are our thoughts mystic F? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10493.411s">What</a> are our thoughts on mystic F? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10495.172s">These</a> are the things I think honestly and it's a difficult subject to broach But these are the things we have to just Scott and and and hey I've been on the council probably one of the longest and This council's been neglecting doing it <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10507.239s">We</a> have not revisited our zoning in years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10510.966s">I</a> think the last really zoning substance was when Councilor Panter-Mayocco did the zoning for Station Landing, and that was back some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10520.265s">So</a> really there hasn't been any meaningful dialogue, so I think committee the whole is fine, but I think the zoning Subcommittee has to get together and we do need some I'm not an expert in it by any stretch I think we need some advice and some you know someone to lead us in the process So I agree with councillor Scarpelli that I think that's a good way of moving forward and if the mayor doesn't see fit to <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10544.553s">move</a> forward, we're the council, we're the legislative body, we're in charge of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10550.136s">We</a> don't need to wait for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10552.638s">We'll</a> drive the bus and the mayor will be a passenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10555.859s">We'll</a> drive the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10557.74s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11649.501s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11651.6s">Councilman</a> Knight read my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11652.821s">That's</a> the one issue I had with this particular resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11656.284s">So,</a> if you're willing to strike that, I could support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11659.708s">You</a> know, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that to run for the House of Representatives, the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11667.795s">House</a> of Representatives, you have to be 25 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11670.558s">To</a> run for the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11671.479s">Senate,</a> you have to be 30 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11674.582s">You</a> know, it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11675.903s">You</a> can vote at 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11677.554s">But</a> you can't run for office until you're 25 and until you're 30 on that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11682.296s">But</a> getting back to this, I support this whole hotly with the removal of the military identification card and the veterans exemption.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11872.954s">I</a> don't know, Mrs. Busby, is it Busby? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11878.116s">It's</a> Busby. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11878.956s">Do</a> you participate when they do the stings within the community for convenience stores that are selling to minors? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11889.079s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11889.84s">Do</a> you participate with that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11902.546s">Could</a> you just briefly give us an update on how we compare to other communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11906.967s">Are</a> our businesses selling in general to minors? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11910.908s">Will</a> this help raising the age even though they may be selling to minors no matter what?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12054.307s">if</a> you did this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12056.429s">The</a> violations that are handed out, are they state violations or local ordinances?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12103.589s">And</a> how much is that for the first offense?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12121.643s">And</a> who issues the tobacco permit, the Board of Health, our Board of Health?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12127.527s">And</a> we don't, it's not built into the ordinance that we could do a suspension of the license, the tobacco license?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12149.298s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12154.76s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12155.86s">So,</a> would we issue a ticket? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12159.241s">That</a> revenue goes back to the city office. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12161.682s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12163.083s">And</a> do you have any reporting on the number of tickets issued and the number of violations per business?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12174.642s">Yes,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12176.343s">Pass</a> that along. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12177.283s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12177.983s">Thanks</a> very much.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12488.362s">I</a> just want to say a few words about Mr. Sampson. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12491.845s">I</a> had the unique opportunity to actually run many, many years back for school committee and Mr. Sampson was on the ballot at the time and I got to know him and he was just a fun guy to be around, a real family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12507.018s">He</a> worked for the school department as a head custodian for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12513.843s">His</a> son, James Sampson, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12516.375s">is</a> a vocational teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12519.078s">And,</a> you know, the one thing I remember about Bill is he'd always be there to lend an ear and talk to you about any issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12527.706s">And</a> he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12530.089s">And</a> the other one was Jeanette McGillicuddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12532.671s">Mr.</a> President, as far as I know, for the past 30 years, Jeanette has not missed a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12539.785s">She</a> religiously watched the Medford City Council, and she will be sorely missed, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12545.83s">I'm</a> a longtime Medford resident, and mother, grandmother, will be sorely missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13606.305s">I</a> don't have the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13607.786s">I'm</a> going to need to table them.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=103.039s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=104.12s">It's</a> my honor tonight to offer these council accommodations to the Medford High row team for the full boys squad. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=116.665s">This</a> is the fourth year in a row that they have won the GBL title. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=129.136s">are</a> JV4. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=130.937s">They</a> qualified for the New England Interscholastic Rowing Championship, and they finished 16th among all the prep, Catholic, and public schools from New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=141.922s">Another</a> big accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=149.545s">So</a> I want to recognize, I know there's at least two on the team that are with us tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=158.047s">I</a> was just talking to some of the rowing team members, and they mentioned a funny story that took place this year at one of the row meets. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=168.755s">There</a> was a race between Somerville and Method, which always gets a little heated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=174.919s">And</a> Method pulled out and beat Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=179.463s">And</a> after the race, the Somerville team came over and said, you only beat us because we had one of our novice in the boats. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=187.494s">And</a> that's the only reason why you beat us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=189.755s">So</a> Method being the community it is, said, get your JV, get your whole JV team, we'll meet you down on the river, and we'll race again without your novice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=199.877s">Sure</a> enough, the race took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=201.857s">And</a> gentlemen, who won the race? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=204.778s">Method</a> won again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=211.56s">I</a> thought that was a great story. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=214.365s">And</a> one other thing, too, you can always tell when the Rowe team walks in because they have the Popeye forearms, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=221.31s">And</a> they're all in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=222.931s">I</a> tell everyone, you want to get in great shape, Rowe. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=226.433s">The</a> only one that's not in great shape is the Coxswain. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=228.554s">Where</a> is he? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=229.075s">Where's</a> the Coxswain? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=234.738s">He's</a> not in bad shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=235.679s">He's</a> not in bad shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=237.62s">The</a> Coxswain is very similar to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=241.259s">You</a> have the council president that box out the orders, and you have the rowers that do all the work on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=248.701s">So</a> it's very similar, just so you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=253.302s">You</a> may have a future someday in city politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=257.702s">But</a> at this point, I'd like to recognize the novice four boat members who were the silver member medalists for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=270.226s">and</a> they did our community very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=273.207s">I</a> will read them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=273.908s">I</a> know there's only one or two here tonight, but I will read them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=277.329s">It</a> says, the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Nathan Piera, Medford High School varsity rowing team, in recognition of winning a Novice Four Boat Civil Medal at the State Rowing Championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=301.587s">We</a> have Sebastian Tringali. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=305.949s">He's</a> at camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=307.009s">Good</a> for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=309.05s">Giandotto</a> Pintone.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=351.488s">Edward</a> McCormick, the coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=353.149s">Come</a> on up, Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=360.248s">You</a> know, we don't have a team without a good coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=362.51s">And</a> I'll tell you, Edward has done yeoman's work, no pun, on putting together a program that really reflects our community and really reflects a program that is up and coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=374.718s">And</a> we went from a community that was not known for rowing at all to being a program that's recognized statewide. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=381.543s">And</a> that's partly due to students and their competitive nature and their dedication, but also due to the coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=388.601s">So</a> coach, do you have a few words you'd like to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=390.443s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=390.943s">Thank</a> you, coach.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=439.235s">And</a> we also have the assistant coach, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=442.142s">who</a> is Chris Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=444.584s">And</a> I want to thank him personally for his efforts on behalf of the students.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=602.759s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=603.98s">I</a> was contacted by a few residents that are seeing cars come up the one-way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=609.062s">They</a> believe it's because of the one-way and do not enter signs being at a much higher than eye level <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=616.173s">uh,</a> view and also the size of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=618.835s">So</a> I ask that this be sent to the traffic commission for, uh, their review and eventual approval.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1442.333s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1443.193s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Longo for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1446.353s">This</a> has been an issue for many years, and unfortunately this city has done very little in regards to trying to rectify the issue that residents are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1459.175s">If</a> you look at the complaints, as Councilor Falco just mentioned, and I went on their website and looked up May, that was the last available, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1468.679s">there</a> were 174 complaints issued by residents of Method, and that's in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1475.143s">And</a> if you look in 2015, there were 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1480.186s">So</a> that's almost a 75% increase in complaints year over year, which leads me to believe that there's more flights over this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1489.952s">And</a> when you look at the statistics, and I know there's a group of Method residents that are organized in this community, and moving forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1498.271s">on</a> a way to help alleviate some of the concerns we have as residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1504.953s">They</a> mentioned runway 33L, and that's the departures that are leaving Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1512.414s">This</a> year, compared to last year, there was an additional 500 flights on runway 33L, which directly flies over this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1522.816s">And</a> that is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1524.697s">I</a> realize <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1525.953s">win</a> patents, and there's a number of circumstances that would alter air flight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1534.075s">But</a> in my opinion, Mr. President, this community is bearing a brunt of the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1540.956s">And</a> to take it one step further, if you go on their website, they have — Massport has a whole mitigation site, and they brag about giving out millions of dollars in soundproofing <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1553.218s">And</a> they list the communities and what they've done replacing windows and other soundproofing initiatives in homes, schools, churches, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1564.704s">And</a> the city of Medford has one noise detector in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1570.908s">I</a> believe it may be in the Morrison Park area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1574.189s">And</a> in my opinion, a city seven square miles to have one noise detector really is not an adequate capturing of <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1583.077s">uh,</a> the noise that we're experiencing throughout the neighborhoods, North Medford, South Medford, West Medford, uh, Wellington, uh, the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1592.001s">Um,</a> and I would ask if my council colleague doesn't mind that we request through Massport that they, uh, add at least another three or four of these, uh, noise, uh, units, uh, that measures the decibel, uh, sound levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1609.017s">And</a> according to, I guess, federal FAA rules, that there's a certain decibel level that's allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1620.382s">And</a> in that area, we may be under the decibel level, according to Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1625.124s">But</a> I would venture to say, if more of these monitors were put in other sections, and I would ask that they be put in every neighborhood in this community, one in every neighborhood, Mr. President, that we'll find a difference <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1637.927s">of</a> what Massport's reporting compared to what our residents are experiencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1643.389s">And</a> so I would ask, if my colleague Councilor Longo doesn't mind, that we request that Massport locate these noise decibel, I don't know what they refer to exactly, equipment in the North Mefford neighborhood, the South Mefford neighborhood, the Wellington neighborhood, the Hillside neighborhood, and I believe there is one in the East Mefford, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1667.556s">area,</a> but I may stand to be corrected on that, but that it encompassed all the neighborhoods, Mr. President, and I ask that that be part of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1678.345s">And</a> I look forward to some more dialogue with Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1682.669s">We</a> may not be a direct abutter, but we certainly experience these flights coming in that are trying to land in Logan Airport, making very low turnarounds in our community, waiting for runways to open up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1697.536s">and</a> so forth, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2420.935s">groups</a> that you refer to.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3030.573s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3031.774s">And,</a> you know, I had the opportunity to read over the proposed ordinance, and I think it has a lot of merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3040.521s">However,</a> you know, we are the legislative body in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3044.524s">This</a> is two and a half pages of city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3048.308s">And</a> even though it may mirror Boston and Somerville, I think it needs to be vetted out within our community, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3055.713s">This</a> is a great way of enforcing occupancy restrictions, which is the restriction that we have no more than three unrelated people living in a dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3067.881s">And</a> I think this would go a long way in assisting the concerns we have with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3073.605s">However,</a> if you look at the city of Boston, their code enforcement department doesn't consist of two people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3081.01s">If</a> you look at the city of Somerville, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3083.026s">Their</a> code enforcement department doesn't consist of two people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3086.828s">So,</a> you know, I think we have to vet this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3089.689s">I</a> think we have to make it realistic for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3093.171s">The</a> one concern I do have is that when we do get the names, I'm sorry, not the names, strike that, not the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3100.514s">When</a> we do get the addresses eventually from the educational institutions in our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3107.468s">That</a> puts this city on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3110.07s">So</a> if we get 80 different addresses saying, you know, there's six people living at each address, we're on notice as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3117.977s">And</a> go off a bit, something happens in one of those apartments, and the city of Medford doesn't reach out and do their due diligence on that, that may be a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3127.945s">And</a> I'm just saying, I think we have to vet this out, maybe even look at language that states, once we receive the reports from the educational institutions, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3136.887s">that</a> the city method is required to act on anything that is in direct conflict with the enforcement restrictions within our community that currently exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3153.891s">They</a> have to act within 30 days or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3157.505s">to</a> just put this through, you know, without any vetting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3163.227s">I</a> think this belongs in the ad hoc education subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3167.468s">Let</a> them vet it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3168.509s">Let</a> them take a look at it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3183.814s">Right,</a> so the paper came from the mayor's office, not from the subcommittee.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3252.396s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3252.876s">So</a> I can appreciate that, but that came from the administration and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3256.959s">They're,</a> they're able to submit a request for a ordinances anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3261.802s">And</a> they've done that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3263.443s">Uh,</a> the committee that council might is, uh, talking about the subcommittee, that paper is still before the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3269.394s">It</a> seems like it was partially vetted out, never reported out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3272.96s">So</a> that's not the paper that's currently before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3275.464s">This</a> paper is from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3277.387s">So</a> if the council wants to go on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3279.373s">without</a> vetting out ordinances, which is one of our main responsibilities, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3284.876s">It's</a> not going to have my stamp of approval on it, because as I just mentioned, there's some concerns within the language that I have that may not be concerns in Somerville and Boston, who have an ample code enforcement department. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3296.881s">We</a> all know in this community, we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3299.643s">And</a> so for those reasons, Mr. President, I couldn't support it unless it's fully vetted out in subcommittee, and I would recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3307.193s">that</a> this be sent to the ad hoc education committee where the good attorney mentioned that he found the appropriate place within our ordinances under the education section of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3317.857s">So,</a> that would be my recommendation, you know, to have it fully vetted out where it is the jurisdiction of this council to enact ordinances.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3341.063s">Well,</a> if he wants, we'll take a vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3342.764s">I'm</a> voting against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3343.664s">So</a> if it dies, it dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3344.884s">And</a> I'd rather see it not die. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3347.065s">I'd</a> rather see it go to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3349.145s">I'm</a> supportive of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3352.006s">I'm</a> supportive of this, Mr. President, but I think it has to be vetted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3355.627s">I</a> think we have to do our homework and not just get a two and a half page ordinance from the mayor's office and report it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3361.889s">We</a> just got this language Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3364.682s">So</a> if my council colleagues feel comfortable with language without looking at it, I'm sure Congress doesn't do it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3370.345s">I'm</a> sure the state legislature doesn't do it that way, but if the city council wants to do it that way, then so be it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3591.941s">Just</a> if I could, and I respect the fact that you took a shot at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3595.239s">The</a> only shot that the administration did was to copy an ordinance from Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3599.302s">I</a> mean, it doesn't take much of a shot to do that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3602.305s">I</a> know, but I'm just saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3603.186s">So</a> to have it vetted out, I don't think is a big concern to vet this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3607.009s">And</a> I'm not saying it is, Councilor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3616.757s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3623.182s">If</a> they were unable to, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3624.855s">get</a> this moving forward, then maybe it deserves another subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3628.998s">And</a> that's no reflection on the members, but maybe it deserves another subcommittee.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3641.918s">And</a> you guys are still busy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3643.298s">Yes,</a> we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3643.818s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3644.198s">So</a> maybe another subcommittee may be a good idea.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3649.74s">I</a> would respectfully ask that it be sent to the ad hoc education committee where that's where it falls within the city ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3658.142s">And</a> I appreciate my calling. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3659.463s">I'm</a> not trying to hold this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3660.963s">I</a> think this is a good idea, but it needs to be vetted.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3682.422s">I</a> made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3683.163s">I</a> made a motion to send it to the subcommittee.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3831.277s">No,</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3831.917s">That's</a> all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3832.658s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3833.558s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. Castagnetti, you asked a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3836.921s">And</a> if you look at section 26-44, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3840.014s">It</a> applies to property owned, leased, rented, or operated by the school, the home of a family member, or other private housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3847.618s">So</a> in my opinion, it applies to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3850.9s">So</a> I think it's covered within this current ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3855.543s">And</a> maybe the city solicitor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4086.849s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4089.27s">I</a> don't want to be the shark at the pool party, but <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4094.29s">Eversource</a> will be digging that street up, as we all know, in 2017, from Winchester all the way down Winthrop Street, the whole length of Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4102.836s">To</a> Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4104.197s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4104.617s">They're</a> going to be digging a trench, and then they're going to be digging 10-foot manholes every certain distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4111.182s">And</a> I did respond back to the resident, who I know well, and I explained that situation, that it doesn't make sense to resurface that large of an area where it's going to be dug up in maybe eight months from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4124.593s">And</a> I explained that some of the issues that they were having was regarding heavy trucking and some of the gullies and so forth on that end of Winthrop Street because of the construction of new homes down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4138.103s">And</a> I think that's a better recommendation at this particular point to have the engineering department go out, check the road from the Winchester line all the way up to Lawrence Road <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4151.512s">and</a> see what recommendations they have of temporary fixes, Mr. President, before we can have, because that road's going to be resurfaced 100% after that work is done in 2017 from Eversource, that's installing an electricity line. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4169.026s">So</a> that would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4170.927s">I</a> mean, I'll support either one, but I don't think that road's going to be resurfaced.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4258.253s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4259.234s">You</a> couldn't meet a nicer couple, David and June Klein, are long-time Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4265.483s">They</a> raised three great children in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4269.806s">And</a> I asked David, when I saw him the other day, what is the secret to a happy marriage of 61 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4277.031s">And</a> the words of wisdom that came from my friend was, it's a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4283.235s">And</a> I think, you know, I think he's correct with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4286.957s">You</a> know, he said it's ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4289.819s">Every</a> day you have to work at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4291.84s">And</a> if there are any indication of <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4295.813s">what</a> life's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4296.794s">I'm</a> proud to know both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4299.435s">So</a> I want to wish them a happy 61st wedding anniversary and many, many more to come.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4324.473s">I'll</a> be brief, Mr. President, but back some 10 years ago, the city of Medford implemented a pilot program where sweeping on main roads would be more frequently done than in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4339.478s">I'm</a> sad to report that the pilot program is still in effect 10 years later and that residents in this community that live on a main road and have to move their car <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4353.27s">And</a> unfortunately, like in Salt Method on Main Street and a number of areas, Boston Ave have nowhere to put their car because all the surrounding streets are resident permit parking, and they're not eligible for a resident permit parking sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4367.755s">Just</a> recently, if you went down Boston Ave at 430 in the morning, it was lined with orange tickets of residents' cars, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4376.959s">And</a> residents have nowhere to move their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4380.18s">And</a> I would ask that either a subcommittee <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4383.542s">or</a> the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4385.643s">The</a> Chief has been telling us they're working on city-wide parking permits, but it's been about two years now that I've been hearing that, and I think something needs to be done to alleviate the concerns of those residents on main streets in this community, and I just want to move that forward, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4471.649s">If</a> we could get a report of the vote of the Council on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4475.229s">I</a> remember the issue, but I don't remember taking a vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4479.41s">But</a> I may be forgetful on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4482.891s">But</a> I'd like to see the vote of the Council on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4488.093s">I</a> have a problem with putting any type of city money on personal property in the community, and so I'd like to see that vote, Mr. President, also.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6012.152s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6013.953s">Mr.</a> President, I'm not sure how something can happen in the school budget if the school committee didn't vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6019.294s">So</a> maybe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6020.594s">Baker</a> can give us a little more information where this came from.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6061.691s">The</a> superintendent just told us it wasn't part of the budget that they approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6064.933s">It</a> was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6065.453s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6065.894s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6066.834s">So</a> maybe Ms.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6075.198s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6077.299s">Well,</a> the dollar amount includes an additional 33,000 according to <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6081.553s">this</a> administration's representative that's up here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6084.696s">So</a> how does that take place, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6183.672s">I've</a> already asked three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6185.788s">I'll</a> ask a fourth.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6251.988s">So</a> the first budget was incorrect?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6256.13s">Is</a> there anyone from the administration that can answer that question?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6262.372s">Is</a> there a budget person from the mayor's office here to present the $162 million budget?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6268.274s">No,</a> is there a budget person, not a paper, a person?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6279.157s">So</a> Anne, you drew the short stick and you're representing the administration on the budget tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6284.459s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6284.759s">That's</a> all I want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6285.479s">You're</a> here representing the administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8035.514s">Mr.</a> President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8038.136s">I</a> actually have a few comments and I didn't know if someone else from the audience, I thought that you, which you were waiting for, for people from the audience to get up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8280.704s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8282.465s">We</a> still have Anne Baker here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8283.925s">Anne,</a> I have a question for you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8294.289s">Do</a> I have to yell? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8295.89s">I'm</a> going to yell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8297.07s">Anne,</a> is the proposed city budget on the city website? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8302.052s">I</a> do not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8304.633s">You</a> don't know? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8305.393s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8309.372s">How</a> is one supposed to know what's in the proposed budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8315.193s">Other</a> than the council, the 56,000 people that are out there, how are they supposed to know what's in the proposed budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8321.495s">Let</a> me ask if Mr. Palmino. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8326.236s">He's</a> the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8327.236s">Is</a> he the budget director? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8330.717s">They</a> said he's the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8331.857s">Is</a> he the budget director?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8338.762s">I</a> asked the budget director a question.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8344.125s">No,</a> I'm not confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8345.366s">Oh,</a> I'm not so sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8347.207s">I</a> asked the woman that was up there if this was on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8351.949s">No,</a> you think you asked if the city solicitor was the budget director, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8355.491s">We</a> could rerun the tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8356.652s">Because</a> she asked for your opinion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8358.373s">This</a> doesn't require a legal opinion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8364.076s">Thank</a> you for your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8365.296s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8366.657s">I'm</a> talking to Ian Baker now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8367.757s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8384.581s">It</a> is not on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8386.341s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8386.982s">So</a> we have $162 million budget and the mayor brags about transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8393.337s">Under</a> this administration, we're talking transparency and there's not one indication of this proposed budget anywhere on the city website.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8405.461s">I</a> know we have the superintendent of schools here and I would ask the same question to the superintendent of schools is the proposed school budget on the school website. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8417.446s">No,</a> it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8419.767s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8422.437s">So</a> here we have the mayor bragging about transparency and open government in a proposed budget of $162 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8434.765s">Residents</a> have nowhere to find this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8439.168s">Sure,</a> they can come to a committee of the whole meeting up here, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8443.811s">They</a> can come to one of the seven or eight meetings we had, but they can't go online and find the proposed budget.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8468.39s">If</a> you can find that on the city website, I'd like to see you find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8472.473s">So</a> I'll get back to my comments.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8491.627s">After</a> it's approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8492.527s">That</a> has been the practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8493.728s">Thank</a> you, Anna. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8494.448s">Thank</a> you for your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8497.229s">That's</a> great for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8498.77s">We're</a> going to put the budget on after it's approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8503.162s">That</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8504.083s">That's</a> a great comment to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8506.905s">And</a> let me just start off by saying, and my colleagues are entitled to their opinion, I've been on this council 14 years, and this is the worst budget process I've ever been through. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8518.395s">The</a> worst budget process in 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8521.817s">We've</a> had countless meetings, and we've been unable to ask questions at these meetings because the administration sent staff <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8530.623s">that</a> were unable to answer budget questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8533.945s">And</a> I don't fault them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8535.526s">They're</a> not budget people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8538.527s">And,</a> you know, it was stated by a Councilor earlier that, you know, this was a great year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8543.19s">We</a> had a ton of questions this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8545.391s">We</a> had a ton of questions because there was no one to answer questions from the administration over the last several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8551.995s">That</a> doesn't make for a good process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8555.237s">So</a> that's my first comment, that the lack of transparency <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8559.846s">and</a> the lack of this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8561.807s">You</a> know, if the administration wanted to send a budget person, Mayor Burke was the budget person in this city for the last five years and created this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8571.97s">So</a> if she wanted to send a budget person, she should have found herself at these particular meetings to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8579.533s">$162</a> million of taxpayer money that this council got some answers to, some half-hearted answers, and some that weren't answered at all, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8592.307s">Second</a> point I had is, yes, there's a lot of good things in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8596.65s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8597.311s">I</a> agree with the addition in the Office of Community Development, the two planning positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8604.456s">I</a> agree with some of the moves that were made in some of the various departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8608.739s">I</a> think we have a school budget that, in my opinion, looks fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8612.582s">And</a> I'll talk about the security like I did with the superintendent last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8616.865s">And</a> I hope he gives the same answers he gave last week, because I think people find it quite eye-opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8622.562s">some</a> of the responses that I received. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8624.563s">But</a> I'd like to go through, you know, we went through the highlights, and I'd like to go through some of the lowlights that, you know, were offered by members of this council, and things that we feel strongly about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8637.307s">And</a> I asked this at one of the budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8640.248s">I</a> said to the council directly, I said, who had impact in this budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8644.229s">I</a> looked around the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8646.069s">I</a> didn't see one nod, one hand go up, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8649.082s">So</a> when you say we bet for 18 to 20 hours, and this was a great process, I don't know where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8656.727s">I</a> don't know where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8658.328s">A</a> great process is having involvement, exchanging of ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8662.931s">That's</a> a great process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8664.412s">Even</a> the school department, after some of the deliberation, came back and added things to the school budget based on recommendations by members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8675.56s">Did</a> that happen with this body? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8677.641s">Did</a> anyone come and say, Hey, I know you offered this suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8680.463s">Maybe</a> we can't do this, but maybe we could do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8683.145s">Nothing</a> at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8685.086s">Nothing</a> at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8685.867s">And</a> I'm only speaking, maybe it happened to other members. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8688.189s">It</a> didn't happen with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8689.529s">So</a> I'd like to go through a few of the lowlights that I believe should have been included in this budget items that this council has worked on over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8699.937s">And</a> we're going to lose progress because of the lack of funding on some of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8704.888s">And</a> I'm not proud to say that, but it's going to happen and I'm going to lay out in detail and it's going to take some time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8711.991s">So,</a> uh, grab your comfy seat and sit back because this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8719.814s">You</a> know, it's one thing to mention it at a committee, the whole meeting in front of, uh, you know, some administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8726.877s">And</a> it's another thing to let the general public know what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8731.839s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8732.799s">For</a> the past two years, this council initiated a line item in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8740.182s">We</a> were the ones that initiated a $15,000 line item in the budget for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8747.145s">That</a> was monumental in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8748.726s">It's</a> never been done before to recognize method arts in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8753.908s">And</a> that was done two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8756.229s">And</a> we went to the art community, and we said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8759.25s">This</a> is not going to just be a gravy train. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8761.881s">If</a> you want additional funding in the budget, you're going to have to prove to us that it's worthy of the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8767.143s">You're</a> going to have to show us community outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8769.204s">You're</a> going to have to show us what programming was done with this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8774.206s">And</a> sure enough, the next year came about last year, and this council voted to add another $15,000, bringing it up to $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8783.329s">Based</a> on the input we received from the Method Arts Council, Mackie, and all the other artists group in this community that are involved, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8791.547s">and</a> putting so many good programs like the West Bedford Open Studios, Circle the Square, and the list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8800.649s">You</a> know, this year, Mr. President, I offered to continue the momentum we had, asking for another $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8811.481s">Now</a> it wasn't just to throw $15,000 at a group of artists in the community to please them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8817.628s">It</a> was because they've shown us over years that they've been able to take this money and use it in outreach, in reaching out to the community, in setting up programs that impact thousands of Method residents, putting a face in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8832.868s">that</a> was missed for so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8835.69s">And</a> I want to go through some of the highlights that were presented to me by the arts community after I offered this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8844.655s">And</a> I think it's telling, Mr. President, that some of the facts and figures that they presented us, that the money in the budget they like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8854.11s">The</a> money in the budget does not fully fund what they're trying to do, does not even come remotely close. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8860.456s">And</a> without the money in the budget, there is no art program for all intents and purposes, because the state has been cutting the arts, as we all know, year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8869.083s">So</a> for 2016, the Method Arts Council gave out $45,300 to 62 projects and field trips in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8879.679s">This</a> represents an increase of $15,000 over 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8885.465s">Due</a> to greater funding provided by the city of Medford, which is this city council, more projects were funded and an average grant amount increased by 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8894.813s">So</a> we were able to increase the grants that we provide to these different groups in the community, an additional 35% to do what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8905.444s">We</a> were also able to fund 11 of these proposals at 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8910.405s">The</a> total amount requested by the community for 2016 was $93,321, which means that we were unable to meet even 50% of the demand despite our increased budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8925.351s">So</a> even with the increases we made the headway over the last two years, according to the numbers from the Method Arts Council, we were only able to meet less than 50% of what was asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8937.596s">Our</a> available budget fell short of the total request by $48,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8941.557s">An</a> increased effort to attract new applicants and projects started to be seen in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8947.339s">The</a> greater visibility is due to the contribution of outreach and the City of Medford's investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8954.861s">The</a> Medford Arts Council was also selected, as this council knows, as the 2016 Cultural Council of the Year by the state, just the third council ever chosen for this honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8966.024s">The</a> citation specifically pointed to, among other things, our new level of partnership with the City of Medford, our regional leadership and public support for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8976.447s">Then</a> it also goes on to say, most of the city's allocations to the Medford Arts Council has gone to community grant programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8985.37s">Some</a> of the highlights in 2016, many of which we funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8990.092s">with</a> the budget request. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8992.013s">A</a> second year of highly successful multimedia cultural exchange at the Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8997.698s">This</a> project caught the attention of the Mass Cultural Council, which was asked to nominate for an award. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9003.542s">Unfortunately,</a> we did not win, but we were nominated for an award. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9007.445s">An</a> innovative touch-guided quilt and sewing program for the blind and visually impaired, which is being piloted at the Senior Center with the intention to expand it to other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9018.404s">Stipends</a> for musicians to play at the Methodist Farmer's Market. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9022.587s">Artists</a> shouldn't work for free, and they're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9024.629s">If</a> you go down to the Farmer's Market, there's music playing all the time, and it's an upbeat environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9031.494s">Terrific</a> new program at Chevalier Theater, including the onstage series that brings in new kids, kinds of brands, and new audiences to the venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9041.621s">A</a> collaboration between the Monkey House Dance Company and the Boys and Girls Club to introduce choreography, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9047.268s">and</a> movement to young kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9049.149s">The</a> Medford Calling Program, pairing prominent songwriters with aspiring musicians from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9055.554s">We</a> are artistically going to paint our crosswalks, which we'll use art to design and increase pedestrian safety and beautification on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9065.141s">These</a> are the things that were done in 2016 by the mayor funding, and I do say mayor funding, in $162 million budget, with the $30,000 budget that we implemented <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9077.37s">by</a> this council back some two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9079.431s">So</a> we were looking to increase it to 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9081.653s">The</a> mayor turned that down, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9086.556s">Chevalier</a> Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9088.437s">You</a> know, we have the budget for Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9093.7s">And</a> yes, there was a building custodian put in the budget for $24,749. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9096.962s">That</a> brings the total budget up to $91,749. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9106.459s">There</a> is not any money, I shouldn't say that, there is very little money for building improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9113.224s">There's</a> building repairs, but building improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9116.107s">I</a> talked to members of the Chevalier Commission, I talked to members of the Friends of Chevalier, and they were all interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9124.76s">in</a> presenting a marquee on the front of Chevalier, to give it a face, to give it a presence, to let people know that it exists, even people in this community to let it know it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9137.364s">For</a> $20,000 to $30,000, I don't know if you remember about a year ago, there was a movie, a motion picture that was being filmed in the city, and they put an old marquee up on the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9148.461s">And</a> I kept the picture of it because, really, it put a face on that building that was never seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9153.783s">There</a> was neon on the sign and so forth, and it attracted you to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9159.084s">I</a> asked in the budget this year for a $50,000 appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9163.226s">Let's</a> not forget, this is a city-owned building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9167.587s">This</a> doesn't belong to Joe Smith, Paul Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9170.908s">This</a> is a city-owned building that the city has lacked to support over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9177.145s">They'll</a> be the first to say, every elected official, that's the economic engine in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9182.41s">I</a> heard it over and over again at the debates from the mayor, from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9186.574s">That's</a> the economic engine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9188.316s">And</a> then when it comes time for the budget, the economic engine is running on air. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9193.361s">Let</a> me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9195.59s">We're</a> not like Lowell that puts money into funding their public auditorium and puts money into bringing in entertainers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9204.157s">You</a> realize how expensive it is to bring in a top name entertainer? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9208.42s">You</a> might be talking 40 or 50 or 60,000 as a retainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9214.665s">Chevalier</a> doesn't have that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9217.348s">We</a> have to be committed to that particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9220.529s">And</a> yes, there's been improvements made, but we're falling short of the mark when it comes to taking that building to the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9229.29s">And</a> I'm very disappointed that the mayor refused to add a line item for building improvements in Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9235.971s">That's</a> an 1,800 seat theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9238.532s">It's</a> the sixth largest theater in the Boston metropolitan area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9243.133s">Sixth</a> largest. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9244.233s">We</a> have it right in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9246.511s">It's</a> all volunteer civic commission that oversees it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9250.512s">And</a> the city, in their wisdom, funds it for $91,000, which includes a $24,000 building custodian, which is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9260.954s">But</a> that's not what's needed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9263.775s">If</a> you want to look at another city-owned building that this city neglected, just take a look at Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9270.776s">Just</a> take a ride up to Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9273.757s">Actually,</a> you're better off walking, because the road <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9275.873s">is</a> not adequate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9276.894s">It's</a> really not safe toe drive up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9280.277s">But</a> that's another city old building that this community neglected for years, depending on volunteers to raise the money, and it's just not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9292.146s">My</a> next one, Mr. President, we heard from Fire Chief Gilberti, and I'm glad Councilor Penta's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9299.357s">because</a> Council of Penta over the last several years push to have the feedback from the administrators involved in our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9308.699s">For</a> years we met with the administrators and we never received their wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9312.68s">And</a> it was Council of Penta that said, we need to know your wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9315.881s">Even</a> if it doesn't get implemented, as a council, we need to know what your priorities are and what you think is necessary for DPW, what's necessary for the schools, what's necessary for police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9329.867s">We</a> heard from Chief Gilberti. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9331.708s">He's</a> concerned about the internal fire alarms within our fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9337.812s">Now</a> these aren't the fire alarms that communicate back and forth, although those are outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9342.894s">These</a> are the internal alarms like you or I would have in our home, a smoke detector, a hard wire detector. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9350.419s">Many</a> of them are 30 and 40 years old, according to Chief Gilberti. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9356.102s">God</a> forbid something were to happen <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9358.372s">in</a> one of these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9360.193s">And</a> we knew that our fire station alarms are inadequate within each station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9367.097s">That's</a> a major concern that should be addressed, and it's not addressed in this particular budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9374.142s">You</a> know, we heard from Police Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9376.823s">He</a> requested six unmarked cars and six marked cars in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9384.688s">Denied</a> by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9386.902s">Now</a> that may be part of some capital improvement plan that we have yet to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9392.088s">We</a> have yet to hear when it's going to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9394.45s">We</a> don't know what's in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9395.651s">That</a> may be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9398.054s">But</a> in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9399.57s">As</a> we've been stating for years, this council, there should be at least two to three cars in each year's budget, at a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9408.035s">These</a> cars are running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and they have multiple drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9413.219s">Think</a> about your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9414.82s">You</a> get out of it after work, it sits in the driveway for 12 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9418.842s">Someone</a> doesn't get in it and drive it for another 12 hours and drive it a different way than you're driving, which is harmful to a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9427.604s">These</a> cars that we have right now are experiencing transmission problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9433.308s">These</a> cars we have right now are inadequate in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9436.75s">They</a> spend much of their time being serviced. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9441.933s">You</a> know, you can't provide public, public safety is probably the most important issue that we provide for. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9448.157s">You</a> can't provide public safety with inadequate equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9452.94s">We</a> already know the police department should be condemned. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9456.445s">We</a> determined that years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9458.667s">And</a> now we have vehicles that the mayor's allowing our brave men and women drive around in that are inadequate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9466.533s">They</a> really are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9468.355s">And</a> it's not part of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9471.137s">We</a> also heard from the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9473.319s">He</a> said, I'd like to have some civilians, roughly four civilians, to do some crime analysis, to do some IT work in the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9483.97s">That</a> could go a long way to advising people what's going on in this community, having some crime analysis available, crime analysis on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9494.735s">You</a> know, I attended the West Method, as well as Councilor Caraviello, the West Method Crime Watch that they had several weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9504.239s">And</a> over and over again, we heard <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9506.538s">We</a> would like a place where we can go and see crime statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9510.221s">We'd</a> like to know what's not only happening in our neighborhood, but happening in other sections of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9515.085s">That</a> currently doesn't exist in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9518.088s">The</a> chief asked for that, which to me is a very reasonable request, and that was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9523.712s">The</a> vehicles and the civilian positions was denied in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9528.756s">You</a> know, a small request that was something that I asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9531.979s">You</a> know, I was approached by one of the poll workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9536.213s">months</a> and months back. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9537.934s">And</a> she said, you realize when we're at a poll, we could be there from 12 to 14 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9544.015s">She</a> said, nothing against the police, but they're there and they get a box lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9550.177s">The</a> workers that are checking people in, checking people out, working their 12 to 14 hours, get nothing, absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9557.599s">In</a> a busy state and federal election, many of them can't even leave in a busy election. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9564.585s">So</a> we're asking them to sit in there for 12 to 14 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9567.567s">I</a> put in a request to add $3,000 to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9573.771s">A</a> line item 5780 for $3,000 to pay for some lunches, box lunches. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9579.335s">And</a> we could do it, the city clerk could do it any way he like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9583.078s">He</a> could provide pizza, box lunches, he can give people a stipend or whatever it might be to get something to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9589.302s">Whatever</a> it could be, could be worked out administratively. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9592.567s">That</a> was denied by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9594.268s">Sorry,</a> insufficient funds for the poll workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9599.47s">You</a> know, the school budget, and I'm glad to see the superintendent's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9606.013s">Several</a> weeks back, I got a unanimous vote from this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9609.194s">I</a> brought up the issue that right now the school department and the city side do not pay for water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9616.737s">In</a> my opinion, water and sewer is a utility. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9619.898s">It's</a> like gas, it's like electric, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9622.472s">It's</a> an operating expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9624.454s">You</a> can't run a high school in the boilers, in the bathrooms, and everything else, the pool, associated with the high school, without water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9632.26s">It's</a> an operating expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9634.322s">Some</a> years back, the powers to be took it out of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9638.725s">And</a> they said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9640.206s">We're</a> not going to include it in our budget anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9642.908s">We're</a> going to put it under unaccounted for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9646.445s">And</a> what that is, every rate payer who already pays their bill is going to pay a little additional more to pay for what we call unaccounted for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9656.449s">The</a> only problem with that is the water on the school side and on the city side is accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9662.831s">It's</a> meted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9664.312s">It's</a> about $400,000 combined from the city and the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9670.152s">And</a> in my opinion, that should be a budget line item under the operating expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9675.013s">And</a> it shouldn't fall on the backs of the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9678.834s">It</a> should not fall on the backs of the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9681.615s">That's</a> a way of taking money out of the budget, putting in other things in the budget that you feel are more of a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9689.136s">It</a> might be a new PR person at 90-something thousand dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9693.878s">It</a> might be whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9696.358s">That's</a> a way of shifting money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9698.86s">And</a> in my opinion, if we want a true budget, that should be within this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9703.685s">And</a> that was a unanimous vote in this council, and it went to the mayor, and it did not find its way in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9710.011s">Another</a> thing that the mayor failed to act upon in this budget, or even come back and give a reasonable response why it couldn't be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9725.845s">On</a> the school budget again, we heard about security. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9730.247s">Security</a> went up 37%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9732.809s">People</a> at home are saying, wow, we are secure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9736.571s">Security</a> in the school department went up 37%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9740.893s">So</a> I asked the superintendent of schools, I said, Mr. Superintendent, you hired building monitors in addition to the one security guard we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9751.323s">I</a> said, what happens at 3.30 when the school lets out? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9757.406s">Is</a> there any building monitors or security guards present at 3.30? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9763.009s">He</a> said, there is not a one. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9765.35s">However,</a> we do rely on custodians, administrators that still may be around the building to keep an eye out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9775.295s">So</a> here we have a building that's open, unsecure, in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9780.467s">and</a> open to the public after school lets out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9783.948s">That</a> would be like saying any state building, go up to the state house and say, oh, they're out of session now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9789.07s">All</a> security leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9790.911s">There's</a> no reps up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9792.011s">Everyone</a> can leave now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9794.192s">That's</a> unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9795.872s">That</a> building should be secured. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9797.593s">There</a> should only be a few entrances that people can get in, and those entrances should be manned. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9804.763s">And</a> then when the building's locked down, there should still be a security person walking around a building that size. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9812.468s">You</a> know, a high school, a school, those are soft targets. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9816.331s">And</a> unfortunately in this city, they're even softer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9820.053s">You</a> know, if we hired new building monitors, why put them on all the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9826.617s">Okay,</a> come in at eight, leave at three. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9829.359s">Why</a> not stagger the times? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9832.461s">It</a> makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9834.554s">It</a> makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9838.878s">You</a> know, if something were to happen in our schools and we were to sit back and say, you know what, we were all aware that these buildings are not secured after hours, but they're open, but they're not secured. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9853.312s">We</a> would feel awful as a council and I'm sure the school committee would feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9859.911s">But</a> just because an incident went by, we had the bomb scares and so forth, and now it's out of sight, out of mind, we can't say, you know what, oh, we're fine, we're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9868.817s">The</a> threat is still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9871.538s">However,</a> the security's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9873.72s">And</a> I'm not happy with the answers I received from the superintendent of schools regarding the lack of security and the lack of secured buildings, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9881.865s">I</a> believe our buildings are overused currently right now, and I believe that should be looked at in addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9892.978s">For</a> the past three years, this council asked, when we get a budget, that if we could have an expenditure line item in the current fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9903.465s">So</a> they show FY15, they show FY16, then you would have either an actual, like Councilor Felkel mentioned, or an expenditure to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9913.312s">And</a> then the budget, FY17. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9915.613s">We've</a> asked for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9917.374s">We</a> were told by the former budget director, Louise Miller, that's doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9921.528s">and</a> it would have been done in this budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9924.87s">I</a> asked right at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9926.871s">I</a> wasn't trying to throw any, you know, hold anything off. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9930.172s">I</a> asked right at the beginning if that could be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9933.554s">It's</a> important to know when an account, coming from someone that does finance, when an account has a surplus or a deficit when you're setting a new budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9943.578s">That's</a> 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9945.319s">It's</a> important to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9947.113s">and</a> to sit back and not have that information, and then at the end of the year, receive a million dollars for transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9954.398s">243,000</a> out of fire salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9959.602s">Guess</a> what that was? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9961.523s">We</a> didn't hire firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9963.784s">But</a> that money will be transferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9966.326s">We</a> told you we were gonna hire firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9968.327s">It</a> sounded good last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9970.609s">We</a> all put it as a highlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9972.25s">I'm</a> sure the administration said, look at this highlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9976.615s">But</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9977.536s">It</a> wasn't funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9978.637s">That</a> money will be used for another appropriation, maybe to fund one of the mayor's other priorities that was underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9986.944s">Who</a> knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9988.085s">But</a> these are the games that go on year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9992.428s">And</a> without a proper accounting in the budget, it's going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=9996.932s">Ann</a> Baker did provide a list here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10000.375s">And</a> Ann, if I had two years of time, I could probably match this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10004.87s">with</a> the budget line items, and I probably could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10007.811s">It</a> would take me some time, but I probably could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10010.652s">However,</a> the fiscal year ends Friday, and another broken promise by this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10021.935s">You</a> know, I read an article, I don't know, a couple of months ago in the transcript, the mayor's first 100 days, and it said, priority one, enhancing communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10035.495s">So</a> I guess not sending a representative to our budget meetings is enhancing communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10041.576s">I</a> guess not getting responses that this council has requested is enhancing communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10048.417s">I</a> guess sending the finance person tonight, who by the way is going to be retiring in four weeks and congratulations, I wish you well in, you've done a lot of good for this community, as the budget person, I think does a disservice to not only this council, but to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10067.76s">And</a> the mayor should have presented the budget, $162 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10072.264s">This</a> is her first budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10073.985s">And</a> as Councilwoman Lungo said, she spent three minutes with this council in the 20 hours we spent going over budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10080.911s">Shame</a> on Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10083.273s">Shame</a> on her. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10086.115s">You</a> know, Mr. President, there are a lot of positive things in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10093.161s">But</a> as was stated by Dr. Streller and some of the other speakers, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10096.549s">We</a> can't go through the same thing over and over again and expect a different outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10101.77s">It's</a> the definition of insanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10106.231s">And</a> guess what, Mr. President, for those of us that ask questions, that paid attention, that care about the taxpayers' money in this community, it's important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10119.874s">And</a> I, for one, am not going to put my stamp of approval on this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10126.07s">If</a> the mayor had the smallest inkling of communication, she would have contacted this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10135.717s">She</a> would have sat down with the council and said, council, you know what, this is a city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10140.481s">I</a> know it's my budget, I present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10142.683s">What</a> would you like in the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10144.444s">What</a> do you think is necessary? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10146.366s">Geez,</a> you've been around for five years, you've been around 14 years, you've been around three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10151.31s">What</a> would you like? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10152.35s">What</a> do you think is needed in the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10155.438s">never</a> happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10157.38s">Shame</a> on this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10159.061s">Shame</a> on this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10161.463s">You</a> know, and my colleagues are welcome to do what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10164.125s">I</a> know some of my colleagues are new to the budget process, but to go through the same budget process year after year and have no impact at all as a council, and that's my opinion, no impact at all, is a disservice to every taxpayer in this community that expects us to do our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10185.427s">We're</a> a legislative body, and we set the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10189.829s">You</a> can count on one hand our function. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10193.49s">Those</a> are the two top. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10196.351s">And</a> to let the budget go by, as submitted by the mayor, fine, if that's your intent, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10203.054s">I,</a> as one member of the council, refuse to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10206.375s">I'd</a> rather bring the mayor to the table and say, Madam Mayor, why can't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10211.297s">Why</a> can't we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10212.987s">And</a> if it's the levy limit problem that the mayor has, we reach the levy limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10219.131s">I</a> think that's the first I ever heard, reach the levy limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10222.974s">Gee,</a> McGlynn was here 30 years, I never heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10225.455s">But</a> under this new mayor, response was we reached the levy limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10229.418s">And</a> my suggestion back to the mayor is, then maybe we should look at the stipends, the confidentiality stipends you give your staff people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10241.39s">How</a> many people are hired when you get a job and you walk into the job and they say, okay, here's what you have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10248.658s">And</a> then they say, on top of that, this is confidential information. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10252.923s">We're</a> going to pay you over and above your salary because you're dealing with confidential information. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10258.029s">Doesn't</a> happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10259.631s">Doesn't</a> happen in the private sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10261.913s">That's</a> party or job. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10263.454s">So</a> if there are people in the mayor's office that are handling confidential information, and there may be, and there's people in the assessor's office, and the people in the treasurer collector's office, and there's people in every department that are handling confidential information that aren't getting these stipends, they happen to be to just a few in the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10281.708s">Maybe</a> we could cut that portion out of the budget, and maybe we can add something for the arts, or maybe we can add something that we think would be a bigger bang for our buck, rather than padding someone's salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10294.69s">Because</a> that's all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10296.27s">Don't</a> fool yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10297.591s">That's</a> all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10298.771s">It's</a> a padding of someone's salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10302.812s">So,</a> Mr. President, with that being said, I will not support the budget here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10308.633s">I</a> refuse to support it on the basis that <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10311.25s">The</a> mayor refused to send anyone that can answer questions to our budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10316.294s">She</a> made this budget, in my opinion, the worst budget process I've ever been through. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10321.678s">She</a> didn't look for any input from this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10324.721s">She</a> didn't look for any input from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10327.123s">She</a> failed to put the budget or proposed budget on the city websites for open transparency and open government. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10336.579s">Who</a> cares after the fact? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10338.419s">Mr.</a> President, if you ran your funeral home like the mayor's run in this city, you'd be out of business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10345.721s">You</a> shouldn't settle for any less because it's the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10349.221s">You</a> should hold it to the same standard, Mr. President, as you do for your funeral home. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10352.262s">Over</a> 30 minutes, consulate.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10522.449s">You're</a> trying to give an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10523.47s">You're</a> great at circumlocution, Mr. Superintendent.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10527.912s">First</a> of all, I didn't ask for a point of information, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10531.855s">If</a> you'll let me speak, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10533.896s">I</a> didn't ask for a police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10535.377s">So</a> that is your first error. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10538.052s">I</a> asked specifically about after hours, Mr. Superintendent, and you have no security and you have no secure building after hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10547.375s">If</a> you can address that, rather than going into these things about having police officers at every door, that is not what we stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10554.958s">I'm</a> trying to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10556.639s">Churches</a> are one thing, Mr. President, but a school that houses thousands of our students deserves the right for security and the right to have a secured building.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10673.278s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10675.878s">You</a> know, I realize within a budget you have to make decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10679.577s">But</a> security is a decision that I'm not willing to let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10685.541s">Security</a> is just as important as the teacher in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10692.405s">And</a> in my opinion, Mr. President, to say during the day, when the students are in there, that you have to check in, you have to show an ID, you have to sign in, you have to — and that process has been tightened up — you're right — recently, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10708.318s">But</a> then at 3, 330, I can walk in there with six duffel bags and not be questioned by anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10717.413s">And</a> I can have access to anywhere in that large campus, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10722.854s">That's</a> the problem I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10724.655s">Why</a> would you take all the security that you just put on and put them on in the same time and leave the rest of the times open? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10734.881s">Leave</a> access to the building open. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10737.503s">I</a> don't buy the fact that we don't have security in our parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10741.806s">I</a> don't buy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10742.866s">We</a> have police on the streets, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10746.735s">Our</a> high school, as you know, when's the last time you had a bomb scare at one of our parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10751.9s">But</a> we've had several at Medford High School recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10755.103s">Yes,</a> we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10756.004s">We've</a> had several at Medford High School recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10758.586s">And</a> you relied on custodians to go around and look for devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10764.451s">I</a> don't know how that happens, but we relied on custodians. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10767.132s">So</a> this other pair of eyes you're talking about that are around the building, I don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10772.693s">And</a> I think that's ineffective. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10774.553s">And</a> I think even bringing that up, as Amir mentioned, that you're relying on that as a means of security, shows that you're really not in touch with what security should be and having a secured building.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11067.174s">That</a> was a perfect statement, the superintendent just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11069.475s">Just</a> like we have seen year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11072.737s">That's</a> exactly what this government's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11074.858s">Thank</a> you, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11075.959s">Just</a> as we've done it year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11077.84s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11078.88s">Madam</a> Vice President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0/2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 21, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=556.82s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=557.861s">And</a> I agree that our parks are underutilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=560.482s">I</a> believe there's 23 parks <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=562.667s">We</a> have the luxury of having a number of open spaces in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=568.688s">However,</a> they are not being used to full capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=571.589s">It</a> was probably about maybe six, seven months ago, I offered a resolution similar to this with involving the arts and how do we get the arts throughout the community and not just centralized in one particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=585.412s">And</a> I know the city of Lowell has done a tremendous job in refurbishing some of their old parks <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=592.201s">that</a> were considered drug dens and brought in performing stages at very minimal cost and had artists do wrought iron work around the park and other things to attract residents back into the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=607.811s">And</a> they're really a success story. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=610.853s">And</a> I would like to, if my council colleague wouldn't mind, amending his particular, I know you didn't limit it to what you put out there, but I think arts would be a great addition <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=622.215s">to</a> the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=623.216s">We</a> already have a vibrant arts council and movement in this community, and I think it would go a long way in soliciting their support also. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=632.763s">So</a> I would ask if my council colleague doesn't mind to also involve arts and the performing arts within our parks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1402.929s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1407.009s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1407.929s">I</a> think for the last, jeez, several months, I've been asking in this budget process that we receive a budget from the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1417.473s">that</a> not only details the previous fiscal year and the proposed fiscal year, but also has a comparison, line by line, whether each line is in a deficit or surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1430.283s">And</a> this is the exact reason I've been asking this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1433.505s">And</a> I was promised last year by then-Budget Director Louise Miller that it would be incorporated in this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1442.532s">And</a> I, as one person, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1444.794s">I</a> don't know how my colleagues feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1446.835s">When</a> I look at a budget, it's helpful to look and say, well, you're asking for an appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1452.977s">Last</a> year, did you spend this full appropriation? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1456.018s">If</a> not, why are you asking for the same appropriation? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1459.199s">And</a> every year, and we were just at a meeting, that we had a Committee of the Whole meeting, and before we received this correspondence from the mayor, I brought it up again, and I said, every year, there's roughly a million dollars <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1472.889s">in</a> transfers at the end of the year, every year without say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1476.67s">And</a> sure enough, we get a paper from the mayor, it's $1,112,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1479.351s">So</a> I was off by $112,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1484.373s">There</a> is something inherently wrong with the budget every year that has a surplus of the same dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1493.157s">That</a> leads me to believe that these particular accounts are, you know, there's a buffer in certain line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1503.013s">And</a> I don't know why the administration is so opposed to providing another line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1508.578s">I</a> mean, the budget, if you look at it, is three or four lines, three or four columns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1514.803s">It's</a> not complex to add another column. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1517.685s">And</a> you have this information, whether a particular line would be in deficit or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1522.749s">And</a> that would be helpful <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1524.588s">as</a> a member of the council when we're deliberating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1527.669s">And</a> I still don't know why we can't get that in the budget process.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1542.754s">We</a> received something, but it wasn't line by line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1545.575s">So</a> in going through it to try to figure out what that applied to is next to impossible.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1580.398s">And</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1581.459s">And</a> I know in a $162 million budget, when you're doing line by line, there's going to be some deficits and surpluses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1588.824s">But</a> to arrive at the same million dollar figure every year, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1594.337s">And</a> I've been doing this for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1596.159s">And</a> all I'm asking for the administration, not to move mountains, but to provide another column that shows me to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1603.167s">So,</a> if we started the budget a week ago, I want to see, as of June 15th, that line item, are we in a deficit or a surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1611.188s">That's</a> all we're asking for.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1615.43s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1615.67s">Coulda,</a> woulda, shoulda, woulda, coulda, shoulda. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1617.011s">Yeah,</a> we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1617.631s">Yeah,</a> right.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1653.684s">You</a> don't, but any wise person would say if every year you're in a deficit in a particular line item, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1660.517s">there's</a> a concern with that particular line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1662.258s">But</a> I don't think it is every year we're in a deficit of that particular line item.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1667.282s">We</a> don't know that because every year, all we get is a list saying, OK, we're going to transfer a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1672.966s">And</a> for the most part, we ask questions, but we transfer.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1681.832s">Well,</a> it's late now because I'm not going to vote for this tonight until we do get a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1687.656s">And</a> I haven't asked this just recently <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1690.403s">This</a> is probably the last couple of budget sessions that I've asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1695.326s">And</a> we were told by the budget director, the former budget director, that that would be included in this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1700.97s">And</a> I realize it was a change in administration, but when you make an agreement, you should follow through.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1717.513s">I</a> could show you the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1718.514s">If</a> you could make heads or tails, that document to the budget.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1727.021s">It</a> doesn't suffice.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1761.606s">What</a> about the salary for fire?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1766.574s">Unfilled</a> positions.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1771.259s">So</a> here we go again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1772.66s">Uh,</a> you know, uh, in a budget process, we say we're going to hire new police, new fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1777.986s">It</a> goes unfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1779.788s">And</a> at the end of the year, without any public fanfare, we take the money that should have been for six firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1786.164s">And</a> we transfer it to overtime.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1792.809s">And</a> it's not the first time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1794.77s">This</a> happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1796.291s">And</a> that's why I asked in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1797.992s">I</a> said there were a number of vacancies more than the last previous five years in this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1804.317s">And</a> I asked for a breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1805.437s">Why</a> do we have so many vacancies? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1807.279s">Because</a> in my previous experience with vacancies is if they're not filled, that is also used as a buffer to take that money, transfer it, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1815.527s">and</a> use it for one of your other pet projects or something else that you might have funded in the budget that didn't have enough money.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2236.159s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2238.24s">If</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2238.66s">Baker</a> is able to get us that information that we requested, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2242.353s">I</a> would respectfully ask that we table this until next week, until we get the responses back from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2250.015s">My</a> other point is also, Mr. President, these are the ones that the transfers that are coming before us because it's a requirement under the state statute, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2263.66s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2269.217s">Right,</a> but there are certain accounts within the budget that you can do transfers without coming to the council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2280.042s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2280.662s">So</a> we're not even seeing the list of other things that may be year after year transferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2285.724s">And</a> that's why it's important to have that actual in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2289.165s">So</a> we're being presented a list of maybe 15, 20 transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2292.987s">There</a> may be another 50 or 60 transfers that are taken.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2297.549s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2298.64s">And</a> that would be helpful for us to know as a council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2301.842s">You</a> know, the mayor sets the budget and we actually sign off on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2306.524s">So</a> that's why this is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2308.665s">And</a> we've been sold the bill of goods. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2309.845s">We're</a> going to see it year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2311.146s">And,</a> uh, you know, so I would ask that a motion to table until we get, uh, the budget, uh, call line item column that we asked for with actuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2320.27s">Uh,</a> then the, any other, no, if we table it, no questions, go out, go out right there with miss Baker. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2329.31s">but</a> she knows what we asked her.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2447.832s">I</a> didn't offer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2449.074s">I</a> don't know who offered this on my behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2452.557s">I</a> didn't offer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2455.42s">Under</a> suspension? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2458.963s">I</a> didn't offer anything under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2460.665s">Okay.</a>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=468.297s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=469.918s">Mr.</a> Flynn is here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=471.918s">So</a> I would ask that he come to the podium so the whole audience could see who he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=476.079s">And</a> if you could, I know you've served with distinction for a number of years, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=483.459s">And,</a> uh, if you could just update the council on any new happenings within the commission itself, standing your name and address for the record.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=536.821s">Mr.</a> President, I, without any hesitation, support the renomination of Mr. Flynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=543.446s">He</a> does a tremendous job on the board itself, and I know board members look to Mr. Flynn for his many years of service and his advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=553.873s">So</a> I want to thank you for your service.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=579.248s">Congratulations.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=646.978s">Mr.</a> President, they have the opportunity to promote what the event is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=650.1s">And</a> if you have a website that people can go on and make donations, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=654.277s">Now's</a> the time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=689.879s">Great</a> job.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=768.405s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=769.366s">First,</a> I'd like to have this meeting dedicated to the Orlando <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=778.504s">victims,</a> which took place the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=782.245s">As</a> we all know, June is National Gay Pride Month, and the LGBT community in the city of Medford has been very active and involved for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=794.589s">Medford</a> High School has a Gay-Straight Alliance, one of the few high schools that was represented in the Boston Pride Parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=804.331s">And</a> I want to dedicate tonight's meeting
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=814.813s">Also,</a> Mr. President, we lost two residents near and dear to me, David Semenza, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=823.676s">I'd</a> like to have a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=826.377s">He</a> is a longtime Medford resident, just recently passed away, and he's going to be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=834.139s">A</a> father, a great husband, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=836.965s">and</a> a great friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=838.706s">The</a> other one is Robert Sarabian. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=841.427s">He's</a> a longtime Medford resident who recently passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=845.008s">Again,</a> grandfather, father, husband, and also a great friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=850.171s">And</a> if we can have a moment of silence for those two Medford residents, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1078.513s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1081.395s">I'd</a> like to preference my comments at the very outset to state that I, first of all, respect each and every member of the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1090.841s">Over</a> the years that I've been on the council, they've made a number of great decisions which have benefited many neighborhoods in this community over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1101.768s">So</a> I want to let that be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1104.089s">I</a> am equally as outraged as Councilor Longo with the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1110.314s">Last</a> Tuesday, this council voted unanimously to ask the board of appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1115.656s">I</a> mean, they're a separate body and they don't answer to this council, but we respectfully ask them to hold off on their decision until we could have a public forum where people could come up from all over the city, including director butters and voice their concern with this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1134.541s">And</a> I am equally as dismayed with the June 14th <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1140.061s">9</a> 51 AM, uh, posting to the city clerk this morning, uh, 14 page decision from the board of appeals that outlines, uh, the reason why, uh, they supported unanimously the project on Locust street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1156.81s">And</a> so I liked, I have a few comments and I'm dying to hear from the residents, but I have a few comments I'd like to make, uh, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1164.615s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1165.337s">You</a> know, it was quoted in the paper a couple of weeks ago on an article regarding this particular project that spoke about the 490 units, the 750-yard parking spots, and the size of the project on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1182.689s">And</a> as part of that article, Mayor Burke was quoted as saying, Mayor Burke envisioned the neighborhood developing into something similar to station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1193.769s">And</a> I, as someone that lives in the Wellington area, can tell you firsthand that I don't consider Station Landing, first of all, a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1204.035s">Residents</a> in a neighborhood share social ties. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1208.377s">They</a> have a sense of identity as a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1211.895s">When</a> a problem occurs, residents mobilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1214.699s">Look</a> what's out in this audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1217.503s">Neighborhoods</a> have civic, religious, and educational organizations existing within the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1224.112s">So</a> I don't consider Station Landing a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1228.105s">I</a> don't consider station landing, when I go down there and grab a slice of pizza, as a place where I see a friendly face or people talking on the sidewalk or communicating. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1240.234s">I</a> don't see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1241.655s">And</a> I don't see Mayor Burke's vision of turning Locust Street <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1247.559s">which</a> has direct abutters and is a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1251.382s">And</a> I stated that last week to Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1253.644s">This</a> is a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1255.266s">Whether</a> you think it's commercially zoned or not, this is a residential neighborhood with many residential streets that abut this particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1263.633s">And</a> I don't want to see, I for one on the council, don't want to see this project turn into a station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1269.578s">That's</a> my first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1271.86s">The</a> Board of Appeals, their decision <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1274.866s">from</a> what I read in this, and I read it twice today, their 14-page decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1280.79s">They</a> said throughout this decision that they were relying on the petitioner's studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1288.235s">So</a> they relied on the petitioner who came to them for this 490 units, and they relied on their traffic study, they relied on their soil study, they relied on the engineering study. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1300.383s">Everything</a> was relied on by the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1303.763s">They</a> also said that we relied on the input from city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1308.026s">And</a> many city departments made recommendations, the Board of Health, the Building Department, the Fire Department, made recommendations to try to improve this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1321.675s">But</a> the one thing missing, Mr. President, Mr. President, I'm over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1330.42s">The</a> one thing missing, the one thing missing <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1334.281s">is</a> resident and neighborhood input. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1337.584s">That's</a> the one thing missing out of this 14-page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1342.707s">And</a> the reason why I say that is the Boston Globe on Thursday, June 9th, if you look under talking points, they have a section that says development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1352.775s">Zoning</a> board refuses to reconsider Alston apartment project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1357.465s">says</a> developers of a contested Austin apartment building are going back to the drawing board after a key city zoning panel shot down their project for the second time in a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1369.675s">The</a> Zoning Board of Appeals Tuesday refused to reconsider its vote to reject 130 unit building on 89 Bright Nav, which is made amid concerns from some neighbors about parking and traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1387.497s">The</a> developer enormously disappointed by the decision and noted they've already spent two years modifying the plan to address community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1401.706s">So</a> here we have a project in Alston. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1404.628s">The</a> developer spent two years dealing with the neighborhood, altered plans, made every consideration possible to reach out to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1413.963s">And</a> here we have a project in the city of Medford, which had a public hearing about a week and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1420.485s">The</a> residents weren't able to speak to about 10, 1030 at night, and then they were shut off quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1425.767s">We</a> asked the zoning board of appeals not to make a decision so we can hear from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1430.669s">And</a> they hastily made a decision without having any feedback from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1436.11s">Something</a> is awfully wrong in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1438.991s">And</a> in my opinion, this council definitely needs to move forward with an appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1443.862s">before</a> land court or before superior court. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1463.254s">The</a> report goes on to talk about a traffic impact assessment, and that is one of the other studies that the Board of Appeals relied on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1472.1s">This</a> was done in March 2016, prepared by Van Nuys and Associates and Corp, and it says the board finds that the proposed project will not have a significant impact on motorist delays or vehicular queuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1489.161s">So,</a> so this is not going to have any impact on Mystic Valley Parkway on Riverside Ave on Harvard, not at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1497.667s">And</a> that was, uh, the, uh, information they got from the petition is, uh, traffic impact assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1505.573s">Um,</a> I might add, it was also done when the metal Glen mall was not in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1511.313s">And</a> we heard a petitioner last week, one of the residents, that stated that they actually went and got a copy of the traffic impact report and they refused to add the numbers that they already had on file for what the Meadow Glen Mall brings in traffic-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1528.673s">And</a> rather than stating the Meadowglen Mall, they stated this project is going to bring in some additional traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1534.938s">So</a> it's not a wash, because we all know that the Meadowglen Mall is going to be rebuilt with Wegmans, which is going to bring thousands of new cars traversing our streets from people not only in the community, but people outside the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1551.83s">In</a> the Board of Appeals findings, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1554.313s">And</a> I'd be happy to share this report with anyone tonight if they want to take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1560.338s">But</a> the Board of Appeals stated more or less the reasonings why they had to give so many variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1566.983s">And</a> these are the findings that I found to be somewhat tough to deal with when it comes to a residential and a neighborhood standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1584.124s">The</a> first finding was the soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1586.725s">It</a> says the site has a unique soil and environmental conditions, drastically increasing the cost of rehabilitating, requiring the appellant make full use of the project site, available development to effectively balance the cost of the environmental remediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1605.632s">So</a> the Board of Appeals is saying, because this land is going to be so expensive to remediate, we have to let them build it to its biggest and best use. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1615.997s">And</a> that would be putting the most units we can on this particular site, so then they could balance the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1624.581s">The</a> next finding was the lot shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1628.402s">It</a> says, the site is also affected by a unique lot shape constraint. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1634.087s">frontage</a> only on one street, alternative means of vehicle access not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1640.61s">As</a> a result, a network of internal driveways and pedestrian walkways must be constructed and will occupy a substantial portion of the available lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1653.616s">So</a> they're saying because of the lot shape, I mean, it hasn't changed in the last 30 years, so I'm not sure why this particular <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1662.222s">petitioner</a> would use that as a hardship, but that was one reason why the Board of <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1669.622s">appeals</a> thought that they could provide the variance based on the soil, based on the lot shape, the topography. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1678.044s">In</a> addition to the soil and lot shape challenges, the project side is constrained by unique topographical conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1686.725s">Specifically,</a> the depth of groundwater varies from one to six feet below ground surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1694.607s">So</a> they're saying based on the water table, they can't dig below <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1699.721s">So</a> anything they have to do has to go on the surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1703.463s">And</a> that is a hardship to this particular developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1710.046s">The</a> board also stated that, and this is a quote, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the zoning ordinances would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the appellant. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1724.3s">a</a> little enforcement of the industrial zoning district height and use limitations would significantly reduce the project site capacity to accommodate multifamily use, resulting in a substantial loss of dwelling units, including much needed affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1742.73s">So,</a> uh, what the board is telling me is that, uh, based on the conditions of this lot, if, if I bought a house lot, mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1751.87s">And</a> I found out that the lot was contaminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1754.292s">The</a> lot had whatever it did in the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1758.175s">I</a> can't go for relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1759.457s">I</a> can't go and say, you know what, I bought this lot, but I didn't realize that it had contaminants. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1764.721s">I</a> didn't realize the dimensions weren't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1766.943s">I</a> didn't realize it didn't have a proper setback. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1769.465s">I</a> just would move forward, Mr. President, and I definitely wouldn't be looking <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1773.708s">to</a> build something that's far greater than the use for that particular project, which is happening here before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1781.513s">It</a> also says that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially deteriorating from the intent, I'm sorry, degregating from the intent or purpose of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1798.693s">And</a> I totally disagree with that, that their zoning relief is allowing for the degradation of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1807.061s">It</a> is allowing for a project that is oversized in a particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1811.786s">It</a> is allowing a developer to come in without any deference to any residents, without any deference to anyone in the community, and build a project that we saw in Alston <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1823.297s">that</a> their zoning board turned down saying it wasn't right for the neighborhood and the neighbors had a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1830.281s">And</a> they went back to the developer and said, meet with the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1834.463s">Did</a> not happen in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1836.384s">So,</a> uh, based on that, Mr. President, I feel very comfortable in voting to ask for, uh, an appeal of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1845.569s">I</a> agree with council Lungo-Koehn that, uh, we also may need an appeal from a butters and residents <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1852.368s">uh,</a> according to the city solicitor and he can speak for himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1856.373s">And,</a> um, I would ask that, uh, also because we will probably need legal counsel, uh, to, uh, make a motion, uh, to appeal before land court or superior court that we also ask within our resolve tonight that the mayor appropriate <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=1874.225s">ample</a> funds to hire an attorney to give guidance and direction and represent this Medford City Council in the process of appealing this project, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=2984.464s">Mr.</a> Solicitor, just one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=2990.112s">Under</a> the FY16 budget for your department, there's claims under $1,000 and then claims over $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=2996.835s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=2998.476s">And</a> the claims under $1,000 started off with $30,000, and claims over $1,000 started off with $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3004.879s">Yes,</a> a very, very modest sum. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3007.72s">Do</a> you know how much is left in that account?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3016.764s">But</a> in the past, there has been money allocated <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3020.539s">for</a> outside counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3021.88s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3069.479s">So</a> you don't have any idea whether or not at the end of this fiscal year, which is coming up within the next couple of weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3075.402s">There</a> may be a surplus in those two line items.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3086.366s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11170.017s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11171.638s">You</a> know, where time is of the essence, I think it's only appropriate, and I agree with what was mentioned by the city solicitor and members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11180.684s">I</a> think we should move forward with soliciting a good land attorney first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11186.828s">and</a> getting feedback and advice from that attorney, and then moving forward on appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11192.09s">So</a> I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11193.331s">The</a> only thing I would say is that in order to get together and discuss what attorney may be right for us, I think we have to either set up a special meeting or an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11204.115s">I</a> don't think we should wait till Tuesday, because I think that's putting us behind the eight ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11212.651s">So</a> I'd recommend as a part of whatever vote we take tonight that we have a special meeting requires 48 hour notice, an emergency meeting we can call without the 48 hour notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11225.337s">But</a> according to the city solicitor, he may need until Thursday to get some names and so forth and a list of names. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11233.48s">So</a> if we call for a special meeting, Mr. President, I think this is such an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11238.453s">that</a> I think we're all available to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11240.615s">It</a> won't take long, maybe an hour on Friday evening, because it's got to be 48 hours out.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11257.048s">Before</a> the weekend?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11260.19s">I</a> think we need to get the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11263.433s">Well,</a> we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11264.454s">Because</a> we have budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11265.414s">We</a> have the superintendent coming before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11268.018s">going</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11268.899s">So,</a> I think we need to get this rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11271.8s">So,</a> I would ask that in the formal motion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11279.785s">48</a> hours from today. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11280.726s">That's</a> due Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11282.607s">Friday</a> evening or maybe Saturday morning.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11316.657s">I</a> didn't anticipate meeting with a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11318.718s">I</a> anticipated getting together and selecting a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11322.625s">and</a> then reaching out to the lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11324.006s">So</a> I didn't anticipate sitting with someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11325.926s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11326.346s">I</a> don't think we're going to get someone that quick.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11331.108s">This</a> will be a selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11332.589s">And</a> then once we maybe make a selection one, two, and three, we're going to have to pick up the phone and make the phone calls.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11353.116s">So</a> I'm available Friday or Saturday, whatever the counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11355.497s">So</a> do you want to do Thursday night? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11357.499s">Is</a> that 48 hours?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11377.349s">You</a> can't, 48 hours.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11527.204s">And</a> I think we want my kids might be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11529.545s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11530.005s">I</a> think council longer wanted to offer, but I'll offer it that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11533.486s">We</a> ask a motion requesting may Burke make an appropriation of sufficient funds <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11538.285s">to</a> hire a landlord law attorney.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks/2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 7, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=596.654s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=598.055s">And,</a> um, I know we have a resident here, Max, uh, that would like to speak on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=604.637s">Uh,</a> this has been an issue that's, uh, been, um, on the agenda for the city for several months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=612.581s">And</a> if anyone's familiar with the area, if you're coming down route 60 going West, heading into the square, uh, right around, uh, pure hockey, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=621.135s">the</a> lane markings are non-existent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=625.697s">And</a> when cars are merging onto that portion of Salem Street, they really don't know which lane to be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=633.622s">And</a> coupled with the fact that if you're on City Hall Mall Road, which is right next to City Hall, and you're coming onto Route 60 from City Hall Mall Road, and you're taking a left there, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=649.921s">There</a> are no markings when you get onto Salem Street which lane you should be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=654.644s">So</a> you could be in the far left lane trying to get into the right lane so you can go towards West Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=661.309s">And</a> it's really a free for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=663.711s">And</a> I'm shocked there hasn't been a major, major accident or even pedestrian safety concern there based on the lack of markings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=672.978s">Now,</a> this has been reported for the past, I believe, close to two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=678.732s">on</a> C-Click fix and it's been escalated up to the DPW, but I'm not quite sure why lane markings that were already established. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=688.941s">We're</a> not recreating a new road. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=691.263s">We're</a> not asking for engineers to go out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=694.505s">We're</a> asking to repaint the lane marking in the area of, in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=700.868s">why</a> this can't be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=702.369s">So</a> I'm offering it tonight, Mr. President, with the hopes that this will go immediately to DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=709.472s">I</a> don't think this is a traffic commission issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=711.633s">It's</a> just a mere painting of already existing faded lane markings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=717.336s">And</a> I would ask that the DPW go out there immediately <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=720.36s">in</a> the interest of public safety and rectify the left turn lanes coming from City Hall Mall Road onto Route 60, and also coming down Route 60 West, heading into Medford Square, right about where Pure Hockey is going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=738.609s">So</a> I would ask that in the form of a motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=741.251s">And</a> I know we have a resident that has the same concern, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=931.251s">I</a> think what we heard tonight is yet again more important feedback that Max just mentioned about when we met with the mayor last week about how we can improve C-Click Fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=941.398s">And</a> one of the issues was that we noticed that C-Click Fix is turning into a blog session where people just blog back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=950.044s">And</a> you could say, well, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=951.618s">you</a> know, we need to paint the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=953.079s">And</a> then someone else comes on there and says, Oh, that's ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=956.38s">Uh,</a> you know, what do you, what do you think you're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=957.901s">Or,</a> you know, and that's not what the intent is. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=960.442s">The</a> intent is as Max mentioned, uh, to get a quick response from city hall, uh, and also to be logged into the system and then get a response back on when a completion shall take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=972.348s">And</a> clearly that's not currently happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=975.289s">And</a> I think there is an omission in the system with reporting back to residents and, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=981.575s">just</a> to close out an item to make it look like the city is responding is not necessarily the best approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=989.519s">And</a> I'd rather see items open and still trying to be resolved than just to quickly close an item and then hope it goes away. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=997.383s">Because</a> I think that's what's currently taking place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=999.804s">So</a> that's why I put this on tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1002.886s">And</a> I want to thank Max for coming up and the other residents that brought this to the attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1009.236s">of</a> the city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2835.667s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2836.727s">And</a> I want to thank also Councilor Longo. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2839.228s">And</a> I want to thank some of the residents for coming down tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2843.37s">You</a> know, this is nothing more than just pure greed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2847.171s">The</a> size of the project, without any hesitation, is purely based on how they can cram the most units in and the biggest bang for their buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2857.934s">And</a> that's without any regards to infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2861.555s">I</a> haven't heard anything about infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2864.386s">Tonight</a> we were talking in budget regarding some of the concerns we hear on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2870.708s">I</a> happen to live off of Riverside Ave, so I'm fighting that traffic almost on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2876.99s">And</a> I can tell you, when you're coming down Riverside Ave, going to the square, right before you get to Locust Street, the cars queue up from Locust Street to the new Panera. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2887.613s">It's</a> a nightly religious thing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2890.094s">You</a> have to wait in 15 minutes of traffic just to get up to Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2894.333s">The</a> other side is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2896.414s">The</a> cars queue up on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2898.655s">So</a> clearly, this development is not in it for anything other than getting the biggest bang for their buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2906.96s">You</a> know, you talk about transit-oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2910.162s">You</a> know, living in the area, I live on Wellington Road, but I could actually walk across the street to Station Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2917.286s">But</a> let me tell you, and I advise my kids also, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2919.882s">You</a> never cross any of those streets because you risk your life crossing those streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2925.784s">So</a> if they want to sell these seven, $800,000 condos or these $3,000 a month units and tell people they're going to be able to walk to Wellington, good luck to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2935.986s">They</a> better sign a big health insurance policy because <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2939.727s">Let</a> me tell you, that's not going to be an easy task walking to Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2944.669s">You</a> know, it was mentioned also about this community not being in front of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2952.093s">And</a> again, I'd have to state, our Office of Community Development consists of one director and one part-time person. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2960.096s">That's</a> what the Office of Community Development consists of. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2963.458s">And,</a> you know, if you look at the Green Line extension where <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2966.382s">Mephitt</a> had no seat at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2968.444s">If</a> you look at any development in the city, it allows the developers to come in and the city takes a back seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2975.811s">And</a> that's exactly what happened in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2978.033s">The</a> speaker prior was exactly right. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2980.776s">There's</a> no one out there from the city administration looking out for the interests of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2987.388s">And</a> let me tell you, Madam Mayor, who was quoted in the paper saying, this is great for the community, that she's excited about it, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2994.95s">People</a> live in that area, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2996.931s">You</a> may not think so, but people actually live in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3001.012s">And,</a> you know, the whole talk about quality of life, whether you live on Placelet Road, or if you live on Cummings, or if you live on Riverside Ave or Parish Street, quality of life is the same throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3012.987s">So</a> whether you're about a commercial district or live in purely a residential district, you have that same right for quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3020.591s">And</a> to think that there's no residents that live in this area, and geez, we're putting in an area that really no one's going to notice, is being shortsighted, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3031.197s">I</a> like the idea of asking the board, because we have no control over the board, but asking them to hold off their final judgment until there is a full <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3041.672s">public</a> hearing where people can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3043.893s">And</a> also, I've never seen, since I've been on the council, the number of variances issued for a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3051.257s">It's</a> unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3052.577s">I've</a> never seen that number of variance issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3056.359s">And</a> to stick a project in where, you know, we have Wegmans, you know, the Shaw site, for a number of years, people probably heard the rumors a market basket was going to go into the Shaw site. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3070.458s">And</a> people of the community, because Market Basket has very competitive prices, were welcoming Market Basket into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3079.145s">And</a> from what I heard, the owners of the property, for whatever reason, kept Market Basket out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3083.969s">They</a> didn't want Market Basket in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3086.07s">Some</a> of the other shopping markets didn't want the competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3089.066s">and</a> now we're stuck with 490 units, of which my kids won't be able to afford, your kids won't be able to afford, and many people in this community are priced out of even the affordable units you can't afford in these particular buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3105.719s">You</a> know, when we sold the old schools back some years ago, we went to centralized schools, we had the unique opportunity with city-owned buildings to use for purposes we needed in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3118.396s">You</a> know, there are purposes in the community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3121.097s">If</a> you have a senior parent that lives in the community and they need assisted living, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3127.638s">You</a> got to send them out to Reading, Andover, not Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3131.399s">We</a> don't offer that in Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3133.02s">You</a> got to send your parents outside somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3136.041s">Senior</a> housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3137.221s">When</a> seniors call me up and say, I'd love to get into senior housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3140.502s">Well,</a> ma'am, I'm sorry to tell you, you may be 75 years old, but there's a five-year wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3146.527s">You</a> know, these are the issues that we're confronted with in the community that we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3151.369s">And</a> if the city had some vision for assisted living, senior housing, more affordable housing, these are the things I think that we should have given direction to and maybe offered incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3163.413s">I</a> realize it's private property, but offer a tax incentive asking that anyone would like to bid on assisted living would get whatever tax reduction to come into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3175.337s">These</a> are the benefits we see, and just adding housing for the sake of adding housing over and over again really is doing nothing for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3184.043s">It's</a> really, when you think about it, if anything, you're doing away with the commercial, who pays a higher tax rate, you're bringing in residential, which pays a lower tax rate, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3193.77s">Eventually,</a> when all our commercial areas are dried up to housing, which that's the way we're going, your property tax is going to go through the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3201.734s">Let</a> me tell you, your property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3203.735s">And</a> we already heard from the city assessor last night that the assessments are going way up again, which is another thing we're going to have to tackle soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3213.04s">But</a> again, Mr. President, I thank Councilor Lungo for offering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3217.362s">I</a> hope this is not the end, but the beginning of some discussion and dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3222.898s">I</a> know within the budget, the Office of Community Development, the Board of Appeals asked the mayor for an increase in their stipend because they work so hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3234.588s">And</a> I'm not doubting they work hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3236.289s">I</a> think that board does do a lot of work and, you know, they work very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3242.034s">But</a> I would say, Mr. President, at this particular time, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3246.335s">that</a> I would hope that the board hold back on their final judgment until this is open and notorious throughout the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3256.678s">There's</a> no reason to ramrod this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3258.679s">Give</a> people enough ample time to digest it, see what's going on, talk about infrastructure improvements, talk about lighting improvements in the area, pedestrian safety that we've been talking about, talk about ways that maybe we can reduce traffic flow in the area, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3274.115s">You</a> know, their traffic report said no traffic impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3278.057s">Traffic</a> impact? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3279.478s">You're</a> creating 743 parking spots, 490 units, no traffic impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3286.962s">I</a> find that hard to believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3288.062s">I</a> turn on the news tonight, Channel 5, they said over the next few years, there's going to be an additional 80,000 cars on the road because of the housing market in this particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3299.437s">So,</a> you know, they're talking about congestion already in the roads, coupled with that, coupled with these giant projects, you know, we're just, we're gonna kill the quality of life in this community, and we're gonna get nothing in return. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3312.82s">We</a> got nothing in return for station landing, our taxes didn't go down, our city services didn't improve, and now we're gonna add a giant other project, yeah, and we're gonna get a million dollars in, what's the, linkage money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3327.379s">which</a> goes to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3328.82s">We're</a> going to get a million dollars in linkage, and the mayor's going to have a ball spending the linkage money, along with the council president. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3335.122s">There's</a> three people that spend the linkage money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3337.803s">And</a> other than that, we're not going to get any benefits, other than the additional traffic, the additional smog in the city, and the addition of, in my opinion, housing that we're already overhoused in this community, and we need better use and utilization of what we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3354.788s">So</a> I thank you, Mr. President, for the time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6024.018s">Just</a> a quick one. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6026.398s">Where</a> this council is going to have an open public meeting next week through a resolution, I would ask that the administration do a reverse 911 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6041.282s">This</a> is an extremely important meeting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6044.263s">And</a> if they want, I would hope they do the entire city, but if they want to do just particular areas, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6050.905s">That</a> would be fine with me, but a reverse 9-1-1 call needs to go out to notify residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6056.748s">You</a> know, we get calls for returning your old prescriptions.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6070.536s">I</a> get three or four calls a week on things that really don't concern me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6075.458s">And</a> I hear the same thing for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6077.369s">And</a> the things that do concern me, I think we should be receiving phone calls about. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6082.753s">And</a> these are the important quality of life issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6085.335s">So</a> I would hope that a call go out immediately notifying people next Tuesday at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6090.48s">There's</a> going to be a public meeting, not a hearing, a public meeting on the Locust Street project, the 490 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6098.846s">And</a> residents are more than happy to come up and voice their opinion on the project itself, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6106.934s">Vice</a> President Longo.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6234.797s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6236.418s">This</a> is a great issue to talk about, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6240.004s">during</a> budget deliberations, which this council for the past two nights have met with department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6248.367s">A</a> little known fact that people may not be aware of that the municipal side of the city and the school side do not pay a water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6261.112s">Now,</a> in my opinion, water and sewer, like any other utility, should be part of the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6271.359s">in</a> the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6273.72s">And</a> the annual non-payment right now of water and sewer by both the municipal and the school department results in an annual deficit of roughly $400,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6288.726s">And</a> the city's quick to say, not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6292.828s">All</a> we do is pass this on to the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6296.069s">They'll</a> pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6297.429s">So</a> depending on <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6299.358s">your</a> water consumption, it adds between $30 to $90 for each of the 14,000 meters in this community onto your water and sewer rate a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6312.125s">That</a> may not seem like a big cost, but that cost should be included within the confines of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6318.428s">There's</a> no reason why that should be outside of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6321.71s">It's</a> part of electricity bill, a gas bill, water and sewer bill, like every homeowner pays. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6328.267s">It's</a> part of your operating expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6331.389s">And</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that the city and its budget deliberations include a line item in the operating side of the school and on the city side that would include operating expense for water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6350.862s">You</a> know, when we talk about accountability, what better when we talk about accountability that the city knows <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6357.959s">exactly</a> what they're using for water and sewer, and exactly what they should be paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6362.862s">We</a> talk about conservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6364.604s">How</a> can the city say, let's conserve Method residents, where they don't really care what their bill is, because they're just passing it on to you, the rate payer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6374.05s">And,</a> you know, you could take a look at conservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6378.073s">Any</a> day you go out in front of City Hall, it's like Niagara Falls out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6382.016s">You</a> know, with the water sprinklers going on all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6386.008s">And</a> I think that's one of the reasons why we need to take control of this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6391.469s">The</a> MWRA has a giant meter, believe it or not, and that's how they charge the city for water that's coming into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6400.892s">And</a> roughly 19 to 20% of the water coming into our community is what they refer to as unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6410.474s">And</a> you'd say to yourself, well, how is it unaccounted for? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6412.515s">We</a> have a giant meter that's accounting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6414.765s">And</a> then we have separate meters here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6417.727s">We</a> have them at the school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6419.247s">We</a> have separate meters in everyone's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6421.228s">How</a> do we have unaccounted for water? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6423.289s">And</a> there are different ways that we do have unaccounted for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6426.831s">One</a> of them is leaks through the distribution system. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6430.653s">And</a> the city tries to address those particular leaks within the water grid that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6437.116s">And</a> the other is there are still some entities in the community on the municipal side and on the school side <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6444.6s">that</a> aren't needed currently right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6448.042s">And</a> the lion's share of it is the municipal school side and the municipal and the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6454.547s">And</a> that's what I'm trying to address through this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6459.17s">I</a> think we have to be mindful that, you know, the ratepayers are paying enough on their water and sewer now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6467.356s">And</a> just to add on the city and school side, like it's not their responsibility, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6474.215s">To</a> me, I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6476.296s">And</a> I don't think anyone should be paying over and above, other than the operating costs, to run a water and sewer program, which is included in the rate payers' bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6487.201s">They</a> shouldn't be paying for this unaccounted for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6489.662s">Because</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6490.843s">We</a> can account for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6492.204s">And</a> I have a sheet in front of me, for instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6496.148s">As</a> I mentioned, it was about $400,000 in unaccounted for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6498.909s">The</a> schools are about $190,457 broken by school by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6501.989s">And</a> municipal buildings are about $43,566. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6503.43s">Irrigation,</a> so these are the different parks throughout the community, $152,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6524.403s">And</a> then we have the fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6527.365s">That</a> is $6,290. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6527.805s">So</a> if you add these all up, and the water commissioner voted to, we have a tiered system now, three tiers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6536.65s">They</a> voted to do tier two, which is the middle of the pricing system. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6540.973s">And</a> that comes out to about $393,000, almost $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6543.194s">So</a> that would be my resolution and motion tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6548.53s">to</a> have the city administration include a line item for water and sewer, and the operating expense on the municipal and on the school side in the interest of fairness, the interest of accountability, and the interest of water conservation in our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6687.284s">I</a> just want to give a special thanks to who provided some information to me, Mr. Dominic Camara, was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6694.326s">And</a> just to touch upon what Councilor Longo mentioned, that was also a bullet point mentioning that the Water and Sewer Commission voted to approve funding for citywide leak detection. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6706.504s">So</a> I guess that is going to take place through maybe the MWRA leak detection program or through the assessments here in the city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6743.591s">Maybe</a> we'll ask that during the budget to see.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9377.857s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9378.877s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9381.958s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9383.199s">And</a> Alicia, I appreciate the time and effort, and also the gentleman next to you who appeared before the Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9390.2s">I</a> have a little different slant on this, and I think I mentioned it at the Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9395.622s">I</a> don't feel comfortable as an elected official dictating to residents who their supplier should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9403.104s">That's,</a> first, my fundamental difference with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9407.459s">I'm</a> all in favor of giving savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9409.18s">I</a> think that's a great concept and I think we could have some type of voluntary plan where the city goes out and procures a supplier to come in, a reputable supplier, and you get as many residents who voluntarily want to sign up and good luck to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9424.984s">Second</a> point is that this would have been an easier pill to swallow if you came to us and said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9432.818s">The</a> city of Medford wants to embark on this particular plan, this aggregation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9441.059s">And</a> we're not going to consider the residents right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9444.2s">We're</a> going to have the city embark on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9446.28s">We're</a> going to have all the municipal buildings go into this municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9450.681s">In</a> over a two-year process, we're going to let the residents know how much money we saved as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9456.962s">And</a> then we're going to roll out to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9459.343s">But</a> what we're doing is the reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9461.492s">The</a> city's not going to get involved in this, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9475.441s">But</a> the city is not taking part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9477.702s">So</a> whatever is decided with this particular proposal, because there's a lot of things that have to be decided with the proposal, we can go through the organizational and role responsibility of the public entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9490.737s">We</a> can go through the degree of local control. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9493.918s">We</a> can go through the energy service side, renewable energy components, what percentage you want to have for renewable energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9501.12s">The</a> city's not going to partake in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9502.92s">You're</a> already out in your own little island doing whatever you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9506.401s">So</a> you're separating it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9508.382s">You're</a> separating the residents from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9511.223s">And</a> I think that's a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9512.863s">And</a> I think whatever was done, maybe you should have included the city to take part in this as well as the residents all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9520.443s">so</a> we could do this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9522.584s">And</a> I think that was the number one mistake that was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9526.228s">Second</a> point, when the city comes to me and says, you know what, we're going to save you money, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9531.312s">Big</a> red flag goes off in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9533.774s">Big</a> red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9535.155s">Because</a> if the city was that concerned, they would have looked at my cable bill five years ago and said, you know what, you're paying for a community access station that we haven't provided in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9546.66s">They</a> would have saved me money then for the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9549.222s">The</a> city is not in the business of saving residents money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9553.024s">You</a> know that as well as I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9554.645s">It's</a> just not in the business of saving residents money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9558.607s">So</a> that's the second red flag in this particular proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9562.429s">The</a> way I read it too, you mentioned about ARPA, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9565.796s">This</a> is from the Department of Energy Resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9568.24s">It</a> says, in a municipal aggregation, customers have the right to return to standard offer service without penalty by opting out before enrollment or up to 180 days after enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9579.536s">Has</a> that changed?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9630.293s">So</a> the state legislature was wise when they created this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9633.354s">They</a> created an opt-out rather than an opt-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9636.601s">Because</a> if it was an opt-in, you'd probably be at 6%. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9639.704s">You'd</a> probably be at the reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9641.566s">So</a> they were smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9642.487s">They</a> said, take on the masses. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9644.429s">And</a> then the masses aren't going to be wise enough, because they're not going to get the notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9648.914s">And</a> a majority of the people are going to stay on there, because they're not even aware that the electricity was changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9654.399s">They're</a> not even aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9655.473s">So,</a> you know, and I'm not saying this is a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9658.095s">I</a> just fundamentally disagree with me deciding what someone's supply is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9666.423s">I</a> don't think that's my role as an elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9669.665s">I</a> don't think I should be in that business. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9672.668s">Secondly,</a> we're hearing a lot about having the council take a vote, take a vote, take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9678.273s">We</a> don't know the cost of implementing the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9681.113s">And</a> you're saying all these other cities and towns that have already done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9684.055s">The</a> cost of implementing the program in terms of staff time, external consultants necessary to design and operate the load aggregation plan, that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9693.04s">And</a> then the city needs to determine whether or not if this cost outweighs what the benefit is going to be to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9700.564s">So</a> why isn't that presented to me first?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9730.544s">Are</a> you saying we're not going to hire a consultant?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9740.67s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9747.054s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9747.934s">And</a> who decides what percent of, uh, the, um, renewable energy is going to be part of a particular program.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9780.631s">I'm</a> asking, who makes the decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9783.613s">What</a> percentage of renewable energy will be part of this proposal?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9799.836s">So</a> someone from the city is going to say, okay, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9803.519s">We're</a> going to opt in as 6% renewable energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9806.842s">And</a> that's, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9807.863s">It's</a> a, it's a worthy cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9809.904s">I</a> get my bill and I said, wow, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9812.813s">What's</a> the extra cost here? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9814.073s">Oh,</a> renewable energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9815.473s">I</a> have to now opt out of that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9818.754s">Once</a> I'm opted in, then I have to opt out of that portion from what you stated earlier, which is another step.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9836.377s">I</a> think the question is, residents should have the right to determine <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9840.629s">Because</a> right now, I could determine, when I get my bill, it says, do you want to have a portion of it for renewable energy? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9846.854s">And</a> I make that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9849.055s">I</a> don't want you making that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9851.257s">I</a> don't want some bureaucrat here at City Hall making that determination, with all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9856.28s">And</a> that's what you're saying is going to be done right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9858.422s">So</a> whether it's a penny or a small amount or this or that, I just fundamentally, I just have a problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9865.987s">If</a> people want to go out in the open market, and if the city wants to assist, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9871.869s">and</a> trying to get as many people as possible in this city to join those other communities, then I'm sure they'll take us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9878.754s">Fine,</a> let it go that way.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9886.46s">Well,</a> we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9888.081s">Maybe</a> the state legislature can create a new law. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9891.304s">But,</a> you know, there's just too many what-ifs on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9895.167s">And</a> I'm not going to be one that's going to tell the homeowner <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9899.517s">that</a> all of a sudden now you have to use this supplier. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9903.458s">And</a> we're going to have a set of eyes on it, whether it's a consultant or someone at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9907.559s">And</a> we're going to try to save you as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9909.68s">And</a> like Councilor Caraviello said, if things go wrong, who are they going to point the finger to, Alicia Hunt? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9914.221s">Or</a> are they going to call the council and say, why the hell did you vote on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9917.502s">My</a> bill is more than it was last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9920.323s">Who</a> are you to get into my business? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9922.243s">That's</a> what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9923.924s">That's</a> what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9924.724s">And</a> ultimately, I have a problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9927.024s">So</a> you're not going to get my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9928.405s">I</a> told you this last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9929.672s">So</a> this shouldn't be a surprise to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9931.293s">You're</a> not going to get my vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9934.194s">If</a> you came with some facts and figures on what it's going to cost for time, staffing, consultants, and then determine what the savings is and compare that, compare to what it's going to cost us in our budget to run this, then maybe I'd take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9948.002s">But</a> I'm not going to do that after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9949.823s">I'm</a> not going to let the horse go down the street and say, well, now we're going to determine. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9955.346s">So,</a> you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9957.691s">Not</a> gonna get my support tonight, but I wish you well on it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9975.438s">Alicia,</a> if you take five minutes out of your day to do something regarding this program, that's a cost to the city and a cost to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9981.88s">And</a> you've already spent numerous time on this already. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9984.581s">So</a> to say there's no cost to the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9986.655s">is</a> being naive, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9990.478s">There</a> is a cost in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9992.3s">There's</a> a cost of doing business, and there's a cost for consultants, and every other underlying issue in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9998.445s">There's</a> a cost for renewable energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10000.246s">You</a> may want to do renewable energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10002.308s">My</a> mother, who can't afford to do it, may not want to do renewable energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10007.552s">And</a> she shouldn't have to opt out every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10009.714s">I</a> want to opt out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10010.534s">I</a> want to opt out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10011.749s">You</a> know, because we know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10013.489s">Residents</a> aren't going to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10015.11s">We</a> know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10016.03s">I</a> mean, let's face it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10018.05s">Let's</a> face it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10018.49s">That's</a> what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10019.31s">That's</a> why the state legislature created the way they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10022.051s">You</a> opted in automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10023.611s">What</a> a crazy idea that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10025.832s">Opt</a> everyone in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10027.232s">But</a> I thank you for your time.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=259.085s">Councilor</a> Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=260.716s">Just</a> wondering if I can ask the petitioner what type of off-street parking do you currently have?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=272.522s">When</a> you say in front of the building, on Publix Road? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=275.364s">Oh,</a> no.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=277.385s">Roughly</a> how many spots do you have?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=284.809s">And</a> how many bays do you have?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=287.651s">Two</a> bays?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=289.272s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=603.815s">So</a> much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=605.196s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=607.476s">I</a> will support this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=608.996s">But</a> I can tell you firsthand, I've supported the last four times we've asked for Evans Street to be repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=616.938s">And</a> we're still in the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=619.379s">So</a> I would ask my colleagues tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=621.892s">The</a> mayor asked for approval of 500,000 for sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=625.895s">We</a> have over 8 million in free cash that we put contingent upon the 500,000 that Evans Street be repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=633.7s">So</a> if we make it part of that report, we know Evans Street will be repaved and we won't be getting lip service anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=640.504s">I</a> would venture to say that Evans Street is probably in the top five worst streets in the entire city without any hesitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=649.09s">And</a> it's getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=650.618s">And</a> pothole patrol is really not what's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=653.919s">You</a> need a whole new grind down and repaving of the entire street curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=659.161s">So</a> I would ask that my fellow colleagues, I'll be more than happy to put that forward when we discuss the paper for $500,000 for sidewalks, that Evans Street, Pinkett Street is probably the second worst street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=672.426s">So</a> it's right next door to Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=674.967s">Then</a> you have Wicklow, you have Pleasant Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=677.488s">I</a> mean, you can go down the list of streets that are in <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=679.813s">deplorable</a> condition, but these residents have had to deal with the street for long enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=685.435s">It's</a> a public safety concern when you drive down the street, you kick up rocks, which is a very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=693.239s">And,</a> you know, I think that's probably the best way of doing it because just merely another recommendation from this council is going to fall with the other four or five recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=705.724s">So</a> I would ask that we put that on the paper that's a little further on the agenda.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1218.084s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1219.725s">I</a> think one of the reasons that was brought up last week, the reason why we need new sidewalks is public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1225.007s">So</a> we can have all the great sidewalks we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1227.629s">And</a> then when a resident steps in the street into a six inch pothole line throughout the street, that's a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1235.439s">I</a> think we have to address them when we see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1237.78s">And</a> this has definitely been an issue for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1240.842s">The</a> council president mentioned a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1242.943s">I</a> think this is the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1243.964s">This,</a> this is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1246.105s">This,</a> this isn't something a wishlist would say out of the street, but like they haven't repaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1250.027s">This</a> is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1251.708s">Um,</a> and I, I did the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1253.209s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli did. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1254.589s">I</a> took a walk around the neighborhood and this street, I'd venture to say is one of the top five in the city of worst streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1261.562s">So</a> you can imagine the condition it's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1263.203s">So</a> we have a motion of approval on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1265.844s">But</a> I'm going to do it during, as Councilor Longo said, during that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1268.825s">People</a> want to vote for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1269.926s">If</a> not, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1271.007s">But</a> the money's there, and the need is definitely there on this particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1275.489s">And</a> residents have been waiting a long time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2071.95s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2072.999s">Roughly,</a> how long will this job take and when will the work be performed?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2106.369s">One</a> to two months? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2107.029s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2108.009s">And</a> what time of the day will it be done?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2125.253s">So</a> you've worked with the police department already? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2128.115s">Because</a> this is definitely a high-traveled area.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2157.595s">Mr.</a> President, maybe at some point there should be a paper added to these reports dealing with traffic impact like we do for many other things in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2168.239s">And</a> that may be helpful to see if there is going to be an alternate route that, you know, depending on the type of work and also what manpower is needed to protect the residents of this community around the construction area. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2183.74s">I'm</a> not sure when we can discuss that, or maybe if it's a public safety subcommittee can discuss that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2189.821s">But</a> I think it's an important issue, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2736.047s">Just</a> if we could, Mr. President, while we have a representative from National Grid, I was hoping that Tim could take back to his superior the fact that this council is overdue on a report for double polls throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2752.236s">And</a> if you remember, Mr. President, we were on a quarterly basis with National Grid <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2758.573s">for</a> a period of time because of the number of double poles throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2763.616s">And</a> I think over the last year, we kind of let our guard down a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2767.399s">But</a> if you look around the city, you're going to notice an increased number of double poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2772.483s">And</a> I realize they're not all national grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2774.964s">It</a> may be the phone company, it may be the cable company, it may be the city on some of these poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2779.968s">But</a> I'd appreciate if you could send us a report on, I know there's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2788.042s">a</a> system that's used, I forget the name of the system, where you guys log in the double polls and who's currently on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2794.545s">What's</a> the name of the system?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2799.088s">There's</a> a system. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2799.768s">If</a> you could generate a report on the location, how long the double poll has been there and who is on the poll, that would be helpful to this council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3812.74s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3814.061s">Uh,</a> and thank you, Mr. Reed, for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3816.703s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3817.528s">I'd</a> like to hear a little more about what your thoughts are or reasoning why, if there's funding available from the MWRA, what is the biggest hurdle in this city to not moving forward on some of these projects that are so much needed in this community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3862.79s">Is</a> it a lack of manpower? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3864.49s">Is</a> it a lack of leadership?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3867.331s">I</a> mean, it has to be something. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3868.451s">You</a> were in the department for five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3870.771s">You</a> must have some indication why.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3927.702s">So</a> ultimately, in the engineer's office, who would be responsible for making sure that Medford takes advantage of these particular loans and grants from the MWRA?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3955.177s">Who</a> in particular?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3959.119s">So</a> the chief engineer would be responsible?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3974.19s">Well,</a> you've made a lot of accusations, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3977.574s">So,</a> you know, I don't think it's fair to... Budgets are budgets.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3983.2s">No,</a> you're not accusing, but when I'm asking the questions on where has there been a lack of communication and where is the process failed, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3992.722s">I</a> mean, I think those are legit questions, and you were there for five months, and that's why I'm asking these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3998.544s">Who</a> would know best than someone that worked in the department? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4001.485s">And</a> if there is funding available, and we were told on many occasions, because as you mentioned, Mr. Reed, that many of these grants and programs that are run by the MWRA are lengthy in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4014.51s">And</a> if you don't take advantage in one year, you can actually take advantage the following year on projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4020.782s">as</a> long as you have a plan in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4023.123s">So</a> I've been told in the past that the city of Medford has exhausted all the revenue or funds, I should say, available from the MWRA and even the zero interest free loans that are, I think, outside of what you've discussed regarding what's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4043.787s">So</a> I'm very concerned that if there is funding that the city is not taking advantage <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4049.781s">This</a> council has talked ad nauseam about INI. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4053.983s">I</a> think we're at about 50% inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4057.025s">It's</a> costing the rate payers that pay water and sewer in this community millions of dollars to pay for inflow and infiltration and treat it as raw sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4068.131s">The</a> leak detection program is another issue that we've had in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4072.514s">And</a> so I'm very concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4075.135s">I</a> agree with Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4076.476s">I</a> think this paper should be forwarded to <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4078.924s">the</a> city engineer for response. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4081.206s">Um,</a> and also if need be that, uh, the mayor get involved, uh, to find out, uh, why we're not moving forward on projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4089.451s">Uh,</a> if, if that is the case that Evans street, uh, you were working on a project on Evans street for the water main back some time ago, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4097.637s">It</a> wouldn't make any sense for this council to approve the repaving of Evans street if the water main wasn't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4103.321s">So</a> that's the first I'm hearing.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4804.194s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4806.035s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4806.896s">I</a> think what we're seeing now is that <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4809.47s">When</a> you looked at the last financial report, it's clear to me that Republic is not taking in the money they expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4818.475s">And</a> these are the type of things we're seeing now throughout the community, is that they're generating revenue any way they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4827.28s">And</a> you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4829.261s">You</a> know, when you outsource a program and lose local control, this is what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4835.904s">This</a> is exactly what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4837.658s">Because</a> if this was done in-house, like the original recommendation, we would have total control over what happens with the program, when the ticketing takes place, and how aggressive you're going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4849.446s">We</a> were always told by Mae McGlynn, this program is not a revenue generator. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4854.309s">It's</a> just to provide parking enforcement and public safety in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4859.488s">And,</a> you know, you bet your bottom dollar that when you hire an outside company, that's not their train of thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4865.691s">Their</a> train of thought is how much money and where can we maximize our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4869.894s">And</a> so that's what we're seeing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4872.275s">This</a> is no secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4873.996s">You</a> know, we knew this was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4875.737s">And</a> when revenue starts to drop, we're going to find more and more angles that Republic is going to use to generate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4883.361s">So</a> this is just the tip of the iceberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4885.702s">You</a> know, it'd be nice if I agree with Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4888.347s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, Councilor Longo, and Councilor Knight's recommendation about asking that they receive their money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4897.229s">However,</a> I think we should take it one step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4900.01s">And</a> we heard from the mayor tonight that seniors are gonna be allowed to pay $25 up front for a senior pass per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4911.453s">And</a> the seniors I've spoken with are still waiting for the free parking for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4917.878s">that</a> they were promised back some seven or eight months ago that seniors wouldn't have to pay for parking in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4924.624s">So</a> I'm a little disappointed in the negotiations that have taken place between the administration and Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4931.689s">And</a> I think what we're seeing right now is a company running rampant in this community and really not caring what the administration has to say or what the administration wants to do about improving <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4947.146s">the</a> traffic enforcement in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4948.886s">So</a> I think, Mr. President, that, you know, Councilor Caraviello, I think you called for a meeting with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4957.449s">I'm</a> not sure why we can't meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4959.229s">Maybe</a> because we don't sign the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4961.109s">We</a> can't meet with Republic.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4973.513s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4973.993s">I</a> think it's only appropriate now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4975.732s">We're</a> the ones fielding the phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4977.693s">We're</a> the ones getting the emails from angry residents that are concerned why they're getting ticketed and tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4983.874s">So,</a> I think a meeting immediately, Mr. President, is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4988.696s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5768.473s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5770.373s">Brian,</a> I appreciate the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5772.793s">This</a> is more thorough than we had two weeks before us, two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5778.555s">My</a> question to you, Brian, I don't know if it was asked two weeks ago, but how do we rate when you get a call or an email from a resident, how do we rate the sidewalk? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5790.215s">Do</a> we have a key of conditions that we rate it and then give it a numerical number? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5797.98s">How</a> do we go about this?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5841.514s">So</a> on this particular outstanding request list that you gave us, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5846.678s">Is</a> there a reason why they're not listed as priority one, priority two, priority three?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5866.281s">So</a> we don't even know from this current list what might be a minor repair, you know, a hairline fracture. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5876.244s">in</a> the cement or something that requires, you know, a panel being raised because of a tree root. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5884.768s">So</a> we don't know the extent of what's on this list.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5914.94s">I</a> guess what I'm getting at is I don't think anyone behind this reeling is opposed to doing sidewalks over. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5921.362s">But</a> I could just state from previous experience, it was back in 2012 when I believe it was Jack Buckley was the DPW commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5930.644s">that</a> he came before us, he asked for the exact amount, 500,000, for sidewalk repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5938.269s">He</a> didn't present any supporting documentation at the time, and the council asked that he go back and provide a thorough list of what work needs to be done, where the locations are, the age of the request, and he did that back in 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5954.819s">And</a> I have a copy of it in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5957.43s">And,</a> uh, it's color coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5959.811s">And</a> let me just state that, uh, he provides us a key and I'm not sure why it would change from one DPW director to the next DPW director, unless you come up with a much better way of tracking. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5973.899s">Then</a> I can see why you changed the reporting, but I could just tell you from the two reports that I received, uh, the one back in 2012, uh, clearly delineates. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5985.971s">what</a> has minor repair, what has poor, what they consider poor, and major. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5994.814s">And</a> to me, that gives you at least an indication what you need to go after. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5999.596s">On</a> your list, there's no indication. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6003.358s">I</a> mean, you yourself just said we really didn't have the manpower to go out and do a thorough review of each of these sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6010.84s">This</a> is just a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6012.641s">So</a> anyone can call and say my sidewalk is awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6015.435s">Okay,</a> with your name, address, ma'am, and they go on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6019.519s">So,</a> you know, I still don't understand what we're going to accomplish on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6026.704s">Are</a> we going to be replacing sidewalks that have a hairline fracture? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6031.809s">I</a> mean, is that what the intention is of this $500,000?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6043.703s">So,</a> Brian, I don't want to cut you off, but what do we, because I've been hearing this year after year after year, what do we tell residents when they call up? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6051.548s">And</a> they say, okay, I have a concern with my sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6054.63s">Doesn't</a> it make sense to go out to the sidewalk, investigate it, then get back to the resident and say, ma'am, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6061.514s">We</a> noticed you do have, you can't eat off your sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6064.256s">There</a> is a hairline fracture, but in the list of priorities, you're not at the top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6069.74s">Your</a> sidewalk probably won't be done for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6073.798s">people</a> led to believe this sidewalk is going to be done that may have a hailing fracture, and it never gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6081.199s">You</a> know what I'm saying?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6109.427s">What</a> happened with the inspectors?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6113.429s">They</a> retired? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6114.049s">They</a> let go? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6114.95s">You</a> don't know?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6125.536s">You</a> know, Mr. President, I honestly, I'm tossed between approving this <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6130.306s">and</a> not approving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6132.087s">And</a> I just don't understand how we can go based on this list that really doesn't prioritize sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6140.889s">I</a> don't know how you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6142.75s">And</a> I don't know how in good faith I could tell a resident that may be on this list that you may or may not get your sidewalk done depending on what. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6152.532s">I</a> can't tell them depending on what. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6154.453s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6155.95s">I</a> mean, I really don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6158.051s">This</a> list that I'm not trying to compare you with Mr. Buckley, but this list of the past that we asked for, I don't know if you've seen this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6165.514s">It's</a> DPW outstanding request. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6167.535s">This</a> was July 31st, 2009 to February 7th, 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6172.297s">But</a> there is a key on this that really describes the nature of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6179.02s">And</a> I can better understand what's gonna be done based on this color code. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6185.038s">And</a> to me it's very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6186.239s">I</a> don't know if you can, that would mean you'd have to review all these sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6190.002s">One</a> by one council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6191.083s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6193.565s">What</a> do we do, Mr. President for future reference? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6195.686s">Do</a> we ask that a sidewalk be reviewed ahead of time before we get a list of sidewalks that need replacing? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6202.331s">I</a> mean, to me that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6204.473s">You</a> know, don't present me with a list if it's not a list of sidewalks that are going to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6209.963s">You</a> know, have a separate list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6211.724s">Have</a> three lists out there, but have one that we're going to get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6215.066s">You</a> know, this — I don't know what's going to be done on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6220.248s">You</a> know, this — you know, I don't know what to do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6224.91s">I</a> don't feel I have all the information in front of me with this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6228.632s">I</a> don't feel comfortable just allocating $500,000 and say, spend it as need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6234.255s">You</a> know, we're the fiscal watchdogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6235.916s">I</a> don't feel comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6238.806s">I'm</a> going to wait to see what some of my colleagues have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6241.348s">But</a> based on the list we presented tonight, I don't think I have adequate information to go forward and approve a half a million dollars.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6444.621s">I</a> think Councilor Lungo-Curran brought up a great suggestion about the 192 tree stumps which include panels, sidewalk panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6453.189s">So</a> I think that's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6455.151s">I</a> would also ask my fellow colleagues that <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6457.405s">You</a> know, if we do move approval on this, that we send a message or at least request from here on in that every sidewalk be reviewed and then graded, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6470.834s">So</a> in the future, it might not happen now, but in the future, we have a report that we can look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6476.097s">You</a> know, it's easy to say, let's just move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6479.219s">But</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6480.68s">We're</a> accountable to the residents of this community and the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6484.802s">And</a> that's taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6485.963s">That's</a> a half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6487.547s">and</a> taxpayer money, and from a business perspective, we should be able to look at it and say, here's a half a million, this is what we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6496.069s">This</a> is not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6497.849s">It's</a> not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6499.23s">And</a> not one person behind this reel can tell me, this is what we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6504.371s">Not</a> one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6505.671s">So</a> I don't think this is, you know, something that we should be.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6513.192s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6514.353s">I</a> don't think it's something that <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6516.297s">We're</a> asking that's out of the ordinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6518.479s">I</a> don't think, you know, it puts a strain on the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6521.781s">If</a> Mr. Kearns, which I believe tells me that staffing's low, then that needs to be addressed because next time we're going to be faced with the same list of sidewalks that need to be done, and we're not going to know what needs to be done, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6536.572s">Where</a> does it stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6537.873s">The</a> buck stops here with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6540.475s">So,</a> yeah, it's easy to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6541.736s">I</a> mean, you can put a paper, I'll approve everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6544.378s">But</a> it's our job to be the gatekeepers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6548.54s">That's</a> what our role is, not just to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6551.241s">You</a> can get seven monkeys to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6554.322s">Our</a> job is to be the gatekeepers and make sure that we're operating like you'd operate any other Fortune 500 company. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6562.006s">And</a> that's what we should be operating the city like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6564.847s">So</a> if we put a contingent on this particular proposal, whether it's Council Longo's, which I agree, but that the next reporting <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6574.321s">that</a> the city, they'll have to hire someone if they don't have someone to manage it, the city, when they get a call for a sidewalk, that the sidewalk be immediately looked at and graded, Mr. President, like was done in previous years.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6592.095s">It</a> would be an amendment to this paper, Mr. President, because without it, I can't support any more work done, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6644.122s">They're</a> just placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6644.702s">So</a> you, you put in a C-Click fix, you get on the sideline list.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7476.118s">Mr.</a> President, a little while ago, I mentioned that I was going to ask that Evans Street be put on this for a complete repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7482.942s">And</a> then we heard from the gentleman that worked in the engineer's office saying that there's probably a need for a major water main and gas main on Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7494.628s">So</a> at this point, it doesn't make sense to ask for a major repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7499.571s">But</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that the city administration, as a CPAPA, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7505.377s">look</a> into whether or not a complete water main and gas main needs to be replaced on Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7513.4s">And</a> if so, that that work be done immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7516.401s">And</a> then we can discuss the repaving of the street, which will probably be part of that work anyways.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7580.53s">Sidewalks</a> be assessed.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7598.348s">That</a> is regarding Evans Street and the water main.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI/2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 24, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=201.272s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=202.812s">Officer</a> Tarantino actually grew up on Alexander Ave here in South Medford and went to the Kennedy School and also played youth baseball in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=213.515s">So</a> Ron, in addition to his father being with the Medford Police Department for a number of years, also grew up in our community and he was a great police officer and he'll be sorely missed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=282.826s">Before</a> you do that, I think a resident wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=284.847s">I</a> think a resident wanted to speak on the committee of the whole report.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1105.669s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1106.67s">And</a> I want to thank Anne Fretz for her thorough minutes that she presented to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1115.134s">based</a> on a very lengthy and very important public safety summit that this council has called for for the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1123.299s">And</a> I want to thank you, Mr. President, for finally organizing this, because it is an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1129.803s">This</a> issue not only is for safety within the community, it's also to get a handle prior to the budget on what is needed to provide police protection in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1144.371s">And</a> I think we heard loud and clear, at least I did, from Chief Sacco that there were a number of things he'd like to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1151.057s">However,</a> his budget has been level funded at the very best over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1158.984s">And</a> things he'd like to accomplish, like possibly having a separate truck unit in the community to pull over 18 wheelers that are going through our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1169.69s">at</a> great clips of speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1172.212s">He</a> would like to do this, but can't afford it because we don't have the manpower and the current manpower aren't trained to pull over these 18-wheelers and check the weight and the equipment they're driving with, if they have chemicals on board, and also their logs and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1193.909s">So</a> that was one issue that the chief mentioned he would like to have additional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1198.486s">It</a> was also brought up at the meeting regarding the Mystic River and how many years ago you never really saw many people on the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1207.689s">On</a> the upper Mystics you would, but the lower Mystics you never saw many people on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1213.511s">And</a> now we have the Medford High School row team on the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1218.872s">And</a> one of the questions I brought up was regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1222.43s">if</a> we have, in case of emergency, a quick response to getting to anyone that's on the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1229.913s">And</a> Chief Sacco said that really the police department's ill-equipped to handle an emergency on the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1237.635s">And</a> the fire department does have a small boat that they would use. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1241.456s">And</a> largely, we would depend on the state police, who happen to be on the other side of the locks, to come to an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1251.426s">on</a> the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1252.907s">And</a> that was an issue of concern that was raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1256.13s">One</a> thing that Ann didn't mention is the fact that this council, and we've even had, I know Councilor Scarpelli had just recently, along with Councilor Caraviello and myself, a Committee of the Whole meeting, I'm sorry, a subcommittee meeting to discuss concerns with the bus stop in front of the Oasis and the need to create <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1283.219s">a</a> truck area that would allow for deliveries, and also the corner of Harvard and Maine, which has been a concern about trucks parking on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1296.127s">And</a> to date, and this has been going on for quite some time, to date, we have yet to address any of the concerns posed by the residents to keep trucks off of the corner of Harvard and Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1312.243s">So</a> that has also been a concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1316.326s">The</a> one thing I would like to mention is that, you know, every community is faced with priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1322.65s">And</a> in this community, it's easy to say, well, we don't have the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1326.552s">Oh,</a> we can't afford to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1328.153s">We</a> can't afford to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1329.774s">But</a> when you have $8 million sitting in what I refer to a free cash account, you can call it a rainy day account, you can call it anything you'd like, but it's $8 million of taxpayer money <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1341.649s">sitting</a> in an account that could be used for whatever the community considers a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1348.171s">And</a> I think public safety has to be in the top one or two priorities for a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1354.874s">And</a> I'm getting tired of hearing, well, we don't have the manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1358.395s">We'd</a> like to go out and enforce that, but we don't have the manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1361.836s">Or</a> we'd like to do speed radar, we don't have the manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1365.497s">And,</a> you know, I think that story is getting a little old. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1368.858s">When</a> taxes go up every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1370.675s">and</a> people are paying more and more on their taxes, and you're getting less and less for city services, I think, you know, we have to know what the priorities are of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1381.337s">And</a> clearly, public safety has taken a back seat in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1386.238s">So</a> I'm happy that the meeting was called for the Public Safety Summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1391.399s">I</a> do, like Councilor Lungo-Koehn, wish that there were more ways to notifying residents <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1399.191s">by</a> putting it up on the city website, reverse 911, putting it on maybe the government channel and the education channel to get the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1411.559s">But</a> there was very little done to promote this particular very important meeting about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1418.684s">The</a> other issue that was brought up is the fact that we have to have better communications with the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1426.589s">And</a> that is on behalf of <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1428.807s">The</a> residents that I've spoken with would like to see an increased presence in the neighborhoods, and would like to see community policing brought back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1437.751s">And</a> that was one thing we mentioned to Chief Sacco, and he said, well, there's a lot of different aspects of community policing, and we're currently doing some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1446.695s">But</a> my vision of community policing is when an officer rides by on a bicycle in a neighborhood, or an officer is down in the square checking doors <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1457.157s">in</a> businesses after hours to make sure that they're locked or to make sure that, you know, the parks are safe, to make sure that there is a presence in the community and not just a drive-by. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1470.867s">As</a> I told you, Mr. President, when I took a bike ride a couple of weeks ago, it's amazing what you can see in this community when you're not just doing a drive-by and when you happen to take the time either to walk or on a bicycle and you can see <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1486.351s">things</a> at a very different perspective than you can when you're driving by. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1490.253s">And</a> I think that's what residents are feeling right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1492.715s">They</a> may see the occasional police car drive by, but they're not seeing the presence that they come to expect in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1500.819s">And,</a> you know, I just can't buy the fact that Manning is so low that we can't perform these basic, basic tasks and basic city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1511.545s">We</a> took a large majority of, in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1516.0s">the</a> workload from the police department, which was to issue tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1520.361s">And</a> we said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1521.541s">We</a> want to free you up from that issuing tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1524.602s">And</a> that's not your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1526.022s">Your</a> job is to go out there, to be part of the community, and to prevent crime in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1531.843s">And</a> I think I'd like to see more in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1537.384s">And</a> I'm hoping that in this budget that whatever recommendations the chief made, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1543.009s">unlike</a> prior years, that the administration take a long look at each department head's wish list to make sure that it's not just a wish, but it's something that actually comes to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1555.774s">And,</a> you know, I hate to see the chief go through the motions of creating a wish list and nothing ever happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1562.056s">And</a> that's been the case over the last several years, not with just the police, with every single department in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1568.338s">So</a> I want to thank Anne Fretz again for giving us that in-depth minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1572.787s">And</a> I want to thank the council president for calling for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1575.69s">And</a> I hope this is one of just many meetings throughout the course of the year, Mr. President, so we can stay in tune with public safety.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1615.544s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1617.805s">Public</a> safety is not redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1619.126s">It's</a> important. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1621.487s">Let</a> me just state, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1623.578s">I</a> don't know if you read my article about four or five weeks ago in the paper, but I asked residents if they thought their neighborhood was safe and to respond back on several questions that I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1635.627s">And</a> I was pleased to say that I received dozens of emails from residents who gave quite lengthy explanations on why or why not they thought their neighborhood was safe in ways that they believe method could improve on public safety in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1653.11s">Uh,</a> so I told residents that it took the time to reach out to me that I would put this on the council agenda and I would go through each and every email and, um, make a list of concerns that residents had in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1668.494s">And</a> as I stated a couple of weeks ago during an issue, uh, that we were talking about public safety, um, I was quite, uh, surprised, uh, because I thought the article that I wrote was going to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1682.852s">elicit</a> responses of people feeling unsafe in their neighborhood, people feeling that there are an abundance of crime-related issues going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1694.955s">And</a> exactly, it was the total reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1698.556s">And</a> I'd say probably roughly 90% to 95% of the responses I received were not towards crime-related issues, but towards pedestrian safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1709.92s">And</a> for the most part, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1712.253s">people</a> in this community felt very unsafe traversing on city sidewalks and on city streets in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1720.68s">And</a> I'd just like to go through a few, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1723.662s">I</a> won't be lengthy, but I think this merits, because I'm not aware of many polls the city sends out to find out what's going on in the community and ways of improving the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1736.052s">Although</a> there's been a lot of transition teams set up, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1739.813s">But</a> I haven't seen any responses really back from these transition teams or anything really done with these transition recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1749.038s">But</a> I'd like to go through a few, Mr. President, because residents mentioned to me that speeding traffic interferes with their ability to enjoy our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1758.404s">And</a> traffic calming approaches, which is something that I've spoken about for the last several years, is a way of redesigning streets to slow down traffic, resulting in safer streets, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1769.867s">returning</a> the streets back to our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1772.57s">And</a> there were a number of residents that really took the time to explain what they thought a safe neighborhood was all about in regards to pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1785.021s">And</a> many of the issues that were mentioned to me via email, and I did have a few phone calls because I gave that option also, but mostly emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1795.122s">people</a> offered suggestions and I know one was, why don't we have more of the raised crosswalks throughout the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1803.749s">And</a> that's been something I know this council and I've personally worked on and raised crosswalks do have a traffic calming way to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1816.279s">They</a> reduce the pedestrian crossing distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1820.602s">They</a> improve visibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1822.862s">And</a> they also slow down speeding cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1826.204s">And</a> that was one thing that was mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1827.865s">Why</a> don't we have more? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1829.245s">And</a> I'm not quite sure why we don't have more, to be honest with you, in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1833.968s">Not</a> just on major roads, but throughout our neighborhoods that are experiencing speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1839.911s">There</a> was also talk about curb extensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1843.673s">And</a> curb extensions are just a way of making it quicker for a pedestrian to cross a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1850.156s">It</a> also narrows the pathway down <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1852.47s">for</a> cars, and cars and drivers will inherently slow down because it's a narrower path. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1859.533s">And</a> many of these approaches are done by surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1863.334s">As</a> I mentioned many times, we don't have to recreate the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1867.036s">If</a> you go on the City of Cambridge website, they'll walk you through step one, step two, step three. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1873.579s">They've</a> paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, thousands of hours to put together reporting on safe streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1882.178s">and</a> ways to improve pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1885.42s">And</a> we don't need to recreate the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1887.241s">We</a> can actually go in and steal some of their ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1891.804s">And,</a> you know, I think that would go a long way to improving some of the concerns that residents raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1899.868s">There</a> was also a lot of concern about, which this council has discussed ad nauseam, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1905.532s">about</a> vehicles parking on sidewalks, safe routes to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1909.995s">I</a> know there was something developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1912.257s">I</a> know we have two former school committee people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1914.559s">There</a> was something developed by the school department, but residents were looking for something that was more widely known in the community and better routes to involve the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1927.628s">There</a> was also talk about the broken sidewalks, which I'm hoping this council will address <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1934.534s">very</a> shortly with a bond appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1937.856s">Crossing</a> lights that are broken throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1942.718s">Crosswalks</a> not clearly marked. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1944.819s">We're</a> almost in June, so think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1947.061s">We're</a> almost six months, almost a half a year into the year, and our crosswalks still are not painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1955.825s">Or</a> I should say a majority of them still are not painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1960.508s">They</a> also mentioned about poor lighting in many <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1963.63s">parts</a> of the community, in particular some of the business districts at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1967.834s">I</a> know the hillside area was mentioned on several emails about poor lighting, and even in Medford Square, although there's been some improvement to the lighting in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1980.084s">They've</a> talked about signage faded or misdirected, so they'll have a sign that tells you no left turn, but you could take a left turn there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1989.393s">or</a> they'll have a sign that's too far back, a stop sign, so you don't know if you have to stop or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1995.738s">So</a> these are the things that are being brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=1998.801s">And</a> we heard from Chief Sacco, Mr. President, the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2002.503s">And</a> I find this very interesting because I called for this years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2006.767s">The</a> Traffic Commission does yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2009.169s">And</a> you have the chief of police who runs a very, very busy department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2013.092s">He's</a> involved with internal investigations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2015.794s">He's</a> involved with community outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2018.645s">He's</a> involved with running a large, very important 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2026.251s">And</a> to have him the head of the traffic division, I'm sorry, traffic commission, to me does that position an injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2035.238s">Not</a> that the chief is not a very worthy person to sit on that, but that really should be someone that can dedicate a good majority of their time to move these issues forward, to go out and do the research, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2048.035s">I</a> mean, the traffic commission just doesn't sit back and listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2050.756s">They</a> have to go out in the street, do the research, and a lot of the committee members do yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2055.597s">But</a> I really believe that that traffic commission needs to be looked at in the way it's defined, and possibly maybe have the chief as an ex officio member and not as the chairman of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2070.181s">Because</a> even in his own opinion, he said that's a lot of work, a lot of time, and it's very time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2077.805s">to</a> do the right job. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2078.905s">It's</a> extremely time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2081.766s">So</a> and then potholes and other issues were mentioned about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2087.667s">The</a> crime related side of it was a lot less, as I mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2093.668s">People</a> thought there should be better communication between the police and the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2100.389s">Residents</a> were concerned that there's not enough available crime statistics reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2106.273s">And</a> I know Councilor Falco brought this up about possibly having crime statistics citywide and by neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2113.957s">And</a> right now that doesn't exist, or if it does exist, it's not adequate enough to give people enough information on what's actually happening in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2123.521s">So</a> that was a big concern of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2126.583s">Residents</a> would also like to see neighborhood crime watch groups throughout the entire city that would communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2132.966s">They</a> also mentioned about community policing, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2135.832s">and</a> would like to see a larger police presence within the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2140.814s">They</a> mentioned about late-night solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2143.155s">We</a> do have a no-knock ordinance in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2146.396s">It</a> covers everyone except for religious and political groups, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2151.858s">We</a> can't put any type of regulation on religious and political groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2156.14s">But</a> I can tell you firsthand, living in the Wellington area, right around dinner time, you can almost expect your door's going to ring with someone at your door. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2165.525s">And</a> it seems to be, in my opinion, the cable wars. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2168.626s">One</a> night I'll have Comcast, the next night Verizon's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2172.728s">It</a> goes back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2174.589s">It's</a> crazy how they do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2177.39s">So</a> that, I believe, needs to be taken seriously also. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2182.972s">And</a> also at the monthly community policing meeting that they mentioned, there needs to be a better exchange of info. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2190.335s">Residents</a> who attend this meeting said it appears to be just a venting <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2195.103s">So</a> people go in and vent and never receive any feedback from the police department on ways to improve public safety in this community, helpful tips on improving policing or how to prevent you from being a victim of robbery or assault or anything else, home burglary. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2215.278s">And</a> they would like to see more communication rather than just a venting session. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2220.681s">So</a> those are the things that were brought up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2223.28s">I</a> appreciate you allowing me to have the time, but this is a very important subject, and we may all feel safe in the community now, but safety could be like the wind. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2235.549s">And</a> it's important that we stay on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2238.071s">It's</a> important that we provide the financial backing to allow our police department to have the latest and greatest equipment, and also the latest and greatest facility, which we currently know is inadequate right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2253.252s">and</a> needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2256.215s">So,</a> I appreciate it again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2259.577s">And</a> I thank all those residents who reached out to me and took the time to explain what was going on in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2266.123s">And</a> I'm hoping some of this will carry through to budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2269.606s">I</a> know it will with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2271.207s">And</a> some of my recommendations will be based on what I — what feedback I received from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2278.313s">So,</a> thank you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3434.912s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3436.333s">And,</a> uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3437.56s">I</a> happen to have been on the council when this came forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3441.743s">And</a> when originally the Field of Dreams was in its infancy, there was a salt tower, as we all remember, which was going to pay for the field and the upkeep of the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3454.991s">And</a> that fell through. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3456.992s">And</a> at the time, I recall the mayor, it was Mayor McGlynn at the time, stating that they're going to be able to get a fair amount of revenue <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3467.575s">from</a> the Field of Dreams, Edgeley Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3470.756s">And</a> that was going to pay for the bond and the interest, as well as any maintenance costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3478.54s">So</a> I'm not sure where along the line people in this community had a lapse of memory, because the superintendent the other night was at a public safety meeting, and he indeed said the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3493.166s">And</a> he even put it in an email to a resident <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3496.582s">that</a> was kind enough to take the notes for the meeting, and Mr. Belson corrected the resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3502.787s">And</a> if I could just read it, Mr. President, it says, the payment for the bonded indebtedness is always paid from the municipal account. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3512.695s">For</a> some unknown reason, the Edgeley Field Bond was charged the school account. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3519.12s">Now,</a> I don't know why the superintendent has a lapse of memory, but he was superintendent at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3526.785s">And</a> when this issue was going on, it was known. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3529.806s">This</a> wasn't a secret how the bond was going to be paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3533.368s">It</a> was going to be paid through the revenues generated through the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3538.63s">And</a> I even have a copy, if anyone would like to take a look at it, boston.com, July 28, 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3546.294s">And</a> the article's entitled, Field of Dreams Set for August Opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3549.795s">And</a> it says, the city which footed the roughly $2 million bill for the fields <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3556.453s">expects</a> to recoup much of the money it laid out by renting the facility during the fall, spring, and summer seasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3563.6s">McGlynn</a> said the rental fees will eventually help the city pay for the bond it took out to pay for the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3570.626s">So</a> this is not, I think people are trying to say something's wrong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3575.47s">The</a> superintendent alluded to the fact that this has never happened before for some unknown reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3584.408s">Maybe</a> I missed something, but it wasn't unknown to me when I took the vote that this was going to be paid back by the revenues generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3592.433s">Now,</a> if the revenues aren't enough to pay for it, according to the Director of Administration and Finance, in her letter dated May 9, 2016, in the Facility Financial Activity Review, she quite emphatically states, operationally, the fund is able to cover expenses with revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3613.647s">However,</a> the bond interest and principal payments are not sustainable by the fund, and as reflected, have eaten away at any balance created the first year of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3624.611s">Efforts</a> are underway with City Hall to identify funding to redirect and structure the debt payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3631.053s">So</a> apparently, that's already happening because the city administration gave $93,000 to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3638.155s">I</a> didn't vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3639.296s">I</a> didn't hear about it until I read it in this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3643.319s">So</a> apparently there's money shifting back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3646.861s">And</a> so I'm not quite sure that the issue is whether or not the school side has to pick up the bond indebtedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3657.505s">I</a> think that's a given, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3660.227s">The</a> fact is that <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3661.352s">the</a> fields may not be generating the revenue that was anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3665.234s">And</a> that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3665.954s">And</a> if we have to look to pay for this bond another way, then we need to come forward and say that, but not to come out and say, uh, for some unknown reason, because the superintendent's a smart man. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3678.76s">And,</a> uh, you know, I, I think there are other smart people in this community and other people with memories. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3685.542s">And</a> I have a good long memory of what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3689.617s">Edgeley</a> Field in fiscal 2015 generated $210,480. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3691.358s">FY16</a> generated $172,982. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3691.818s">So</a> clearly, that is not enough to pay for the maintenance and the bond indebtedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3696.38s">But,</a> Mr. President, it's clearly the responsibility of the school side <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3718.832s">to</a> pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3720.253s">I</a> have no reservation about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3723.375s">And</a> if the discussion needs to be had with the school department and the school committee, then they should have those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3731.141s">But</a> that's not trying to pull the wool over people's eyes and say that this was never a topic, it was never intended to be paid for by the school committee, by the school department, because that is quite emphatically untrue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3745.063s">And</a> we all received a copy of the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3751.305s">And</a> I guess there was just another one voted on recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3754.346s">But</a> I found it quite amazing, Mr. President, that this entity that may put up the bubble structure on Edgeley Field for the winter months, the city is going to charge them $75,000 in rental for those months. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3773.289s">And</a> I find it quite amazing that if you do the math, and I did it on the back of a sheet with a pencil, so it's not exact. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3782.025s">But</a> if you look at the hours that are in the RFP and the days that are in the RFP that this outside entity has control of the facility, it comes out to roughly $62.25 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3796.689s">So</a> that's what the city of Medford's saying, OK, you want to go back there and practically own our whole edge of the field? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3803.35s">We're</a> going to charge you $62.25. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3804.15s">The</a> amazing part about it, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3811.141s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli could probably speak better than I could on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3814.543s">Method</a> Yutzaka is currently paying, I believe it is $75 per hour for Edgeley Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3825.109s">And</a> under this RFP, and the way I understand it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3829.393s">The</a> fees aren't cemented yet, so I guess they haven't really figured it out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3834.036s">But</a> the RFP calls for rentals to groups affiliated with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3840.539s">And</a> the Medford Public Schools would pay $145 per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3846.903s">So</a> here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3847.884s">The</a> residents bonded this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3850.005s">We</a> all gave our money to put up $2 million to bond it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3854.227s">It's</a> our edge of the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3855.728s">We're</a> going to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3856.689s">We're</a> going to give it to an outside entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3859.412s">And</a> we're going to have that outside entity make money off our bond that the residents paid for by charging our students, our youth groups, double the price to rent the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3873.798s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3876.44s">You</a> know, if we want to get into the business of utilizing that field year round and put our own bubble, we should have that discussion then. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3884.203s">Let's</a> talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3885.964s">But</a> to outsource it to an outside entity, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3889.032s">after</a> the residents of this community are paying for the bond and then charging our own students and our own residents double the fee to use the field is a fleecing of the taxpayers of this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3904.602s">There's</a> no other way of stating it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3907.003s">And,</a> you know, more needs to be done on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3909.324s">I</a> know the school committee is moving forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3912.665s">But</a> let me tell you, more needs to be done on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3915.566s">More</a> needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3917.346s">And</a> the way I understand it is these prices don't even include the heating of the bubble.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3935.169s">Well,</a> that may be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3937.11s">I</a> didn't see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3938.35s">It's</a> a rather large RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3940.251s">I</a> didn't see that, but, uh, the fee has doubled, uh, unless it gets changed again, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3946.214s">But</a> I, as one member of this council, I'm not going to sit by, uh, after the residents are paying for this $2 million bond, giving it to an outside community, uh, an outside entity, uh, to make money off our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3959.66s">That's</a> what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3960.748s">They're</a> making money off our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3962.449s">And</a> then in 10 years, according to the contract, we own the bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3966.23s">You</a> know what the bubble's going to look like in 10 years from now? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3969.331s">The</a> bubble's going to be burst in 10 years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3971.532s">It's</a> not something we're going to want to inherit in 10 years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3975.533s">So</a> we really need to take a closer look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3979.594s">I</a> thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3980.995s">I</a> hope we get answers on this immediately, because this is taxpayer money that's being expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3988.545s">In</a> the interest of our youth sports, in the interest of our sports at Medford High School, this needs a closer scrutiny before it gets approved, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4535.106s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4536.626s">And</a> just one other aspect of the very lengthy RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4540.548s">It</a> also states that this outside entity will be responsible for any snow removal leading up to the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4548.59s">And</a> in the case they don't provide snow removal, the city of Medford will provide snow removal and then get reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4555.593s">So</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4556.353s">We're</a> going to have our manpower getting off the streets and doing what they need to do, freeing up the schools and <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4562.642s">and</a> doing parking lots and everything else to go clean this for a men's soccer league that has nothing to do with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4570.545s">So</a> there's a lot of things in here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4572.826s">If</a> we start going through it line by line, I don't see how this is paying off for our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=6465.189s">So</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=6467.61s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=6468.059s">Mack</a> Maskey was a fixture in this community for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=6472.78s">He</a> was a great family man, and he is gonna solely be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=6477.042s">And</a> Dorothy Selfridge was very active in the community also, and she lived on Warren Street and had a number of sons, and they were just a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=6489.866s">And</a> again, she will be solely missed.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6eg7OrlpwNA/2025-03-21_6eg7OrlpwNA.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 26, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=919.059s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=920.74s">I</a> think some of the initial concern was raised by a resident that <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=926.849s">went</a> down to the building department and reviewed the building plans and plot plans for that particular piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=936.252s">And</a> there was some notes put on the plot plan, I believe it was, that said, this is not a buildable lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=944.894s">A</a> lot cannot be built on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=946.735s">And</a> they were handwritten notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=948.835s">I</a> know, if I could just make my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=951.373s">And</a> I think at the time, and this is going back many years ago, is that someone from the building department went down and looked at it and said, based on this tree, this beech tree that's 125 years old that was probably there before many of the homes in the area, that in his opinion, you couldn't build <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=970.805s">Because</a> the lot with that tree on it wasn't big enough to put a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=975.028s">But</a> legally, I guess, from what I was told by John Bavuso, is that lot meets every requirement as a buildable lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=984.636s">And</a> that was some of the confusion, because that was the original email I sent out on behalf of the resident.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1094.843s">And</a> just the other point I have, Mr. President, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1099.602s">In</a> addition to the tree, which I agree, I mean, that tree makes up the very fabric of that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1105.507s">It's</a> like the tree, the magnificent tree across from St. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1109.11s">Joseph's</a> School that's been on that front lawn for 150 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1113.814s">And</a> I don't know what the type of tree it is, but it's a beautiful, the leaves come out purple. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1118.418s">It's</a> just a beautiful tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1119.419s">It's</a> on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1121.679s">I</a> could see why neighbors would get upset, but I think some of the concern I have also is with, I went by the other day and I noticed the curb cuts on Metcalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1135.633s">And</a> I'm under the impression that if there is another house built at the corner, that they're going to be petitioning for curb cuts on Walnut.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1147.437s">That's</a> what I'm under the impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1148.737s">And,</a> uh, you know, I think this is some of the concern, uh, it's tight neighborhood to park already. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1154.079s">Um,</a> as everyone is aware of and anytime you take, even if it's just a few spots of parking, especially in Metcalfe, it makes a big difference to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1164.582s">Although</a> he did put a number of, uh, surface slots on his own property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1168.744s">Um,</a> there still is a concern in the area, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1172.827s">I'm</a> not sure what can be done for the tree itself, not to make light of it, but I've seen some unique shows on A&E where they make beautiful tree houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1183.01s">And</a> I was thinking maybe if we could make a combination house with the tree somehow, maybe be the centerpiece when you walk in, something to that effect that we may be able to come to a compromise.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1198.974s">I</a> thought so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1346.382s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President, um, many people may not be aware, but, uh, our building commission has been out with, uh, um, surgery, uh, and, uh, hope he recovers quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1357.788s">And</a> I personally would like to thank, uh, solicitor Romley. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1362.519s">because</a> he stepped up to the plate on a number of issues to address things that maybe are out of his purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1369.722s">And</a> he's done a great job, and I know this is one of them that he stepped up to assist the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1376.846s">It</a> may not be the answer the residents wanted, but at least they got some answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1380.967s">And</a> I just want to personally thank Solicitor Rumley.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2094.615s">Councilman</a> Miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2096.377s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2098.36s">I</a> remember when DOT was before us and one of the questions that was asked <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2102.742s">regarding</a> construction equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2105.404s">We</a> had concern that equipment would be moved off the roadway during certain hours of non-work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2111.847s">But</a> one of the questions that was asked was about power washing of buildings and windows in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2117.43s">To</a> date, Mari, have you seen any power washing? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2121.152s">I</a> know you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2126.375s">So</a> that was one day that they cleaned windows? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2129.077s">And</a> the construction's been going on for, <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2134.995s">since</a> October. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2136.336s">So,</a> Mr. President, as part of whatever recommendations, and I agree with the signage, that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2142.662s">I</a> think we have to note, Mr. President, that when DOT came in, I think the city really could have played hardball at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2150.228s">This</a> was a huge disruption to traffic flow, to businesses, <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2154.654s">to</a> residents, to people catching the bus, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2158.375s">And</a> we allowed a temporary bridge to cross private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2161.876s">We</a> allowed them to put up barriers in front of well-established businesses, crippling these businesses in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2171.018s">No</a> one, to be quite honest with you, wants to walk down by that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2174.539s">And</a> I can see how this is going to have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2177.92s">And</a> I wish I could tell you it's going to end soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2180.1s">And</a> as you know, it's going to be for <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2184.83s">a</a> while out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2187.211s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that I know when we ask them to come before us, they come and they don't really give us any answers, or they years us to death. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2199.414s">And,</a> you know, I'm not sure what the next step is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2202.675s">This</a> council a while back recommended that we halt the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2209.301s">and</a> have the building commissioner go out there and put a cease and desist in that particular area until we get hard fact answers on some of the concerns that are being raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2220.149s">And</a> at the time, I thought it was a great suggestion, but I'm not sure if the city has the stomach to do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2230.257s">But</a> I can tell you, if I was in the corner office, that would be the first thing I'd do on behalf of the business owners and the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2237.541s">And</a> it's not to stop progress, and it's not to stop the Craddock Bridge, which we all know needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2243.044s">It's</a> to make sure that we're looking out for the interest of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2246.946s">And</a> I don't see that happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2248.587s">I</a> really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2249.187s">You</a> can appoint all the point people you want, but I don't see any of the major issues being followed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2256.491s">And</a> lastly, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2258.247s">When</a> they did the Fast 14 project out here through the square, one of the largest building projects, highway building projects in bridge repair in this state's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2268.435s">It</a> happened over several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2270.997s">It</a> was a minor disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2272.999s">And</a> the contractor, which was hired by the state, paid mitigation money to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2279.566s">and</a> we repaved Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2281.788s">I</a> think we bought some new police cruises. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2284.13s">We</a> did a number of things with that mitigation money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2286.992s">They</a> had a senior picnic because the seniors had to listen to the disruption and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2294.299s">And</a> now we have a gentleman that's practically, you already told us, he lost his afternoon business. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2300.744s">He's</a> being practically put out of business and the state will not discuss, the state said we do not pay mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2308.582s">When</a> they did the big project 93, they paid all those particular businesses, Techie and all the businesses going along 93 when they did the big dig. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2322.289s">They</a> all got mitigation money and they looked at their records and saw that the business went down during this particular period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2329.215s">And</a> they paid the business owners, and rightfully so, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2332.816s">And</a> here we have a business owner in the city that the state won't even entertain it, saying they don't pay mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2342.02s">I</a> just find that difficult to swallow, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2345.982s">And,</a> you know, we're not against progress, but we're against local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2351.664s">It's</a> tough enough in the square to make business. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2354.565s">And</a> when you have a project like this and hurting <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2357.556s">these</a> local people that are really trying to stick it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2361.258s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2361.438s">But,</a> Mara, you're trying to stick it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2362.839s">You're</a> trying to — it's a matter of day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2366.341s">It's</a> a matter of day to day for these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2368.302s">And,</a> you know, I'm really at wit's end with this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2373.985s">And</a> I can't imagine having a business for two and a half to three years put up with this type of debris, dirt, construction, barriers, and you name it, every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2384.551s">I</a> can't imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2387.411s">So</a> I think we have to ask again, and it was unanimous vote last time, unanimous vote by this council for a cease and desist. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2395.216s">But</a> if councils aren't ready to vote on that, or if they'd rather discuss this with the administration, I think we should discuss it with the mayor first. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2402.92s">The</a> mayor has a lot of leverage with different state departments, in particular DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2408.023s">And</a> I think we should call for a meeting with the mayor, Mr. President, to discuss this issue.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2415.672s">So</a> I look for your leadership, Mr. President, to set something up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2973.954s">What</a> are your anticipated hours of operation? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2976.296s">I</a> know what they say on the paper.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3012.524s">And</a> do you anticipate how many cars can you fit on your exterior lot for parking on the exterior lot?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3046.015s">Did</a> you ever anticipate using the street to podcast?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3076.619s">So</a> I know recently there was a driveway put in from Riverside to that back part of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3083.941s">Do</a> you anticipate using that as an entrance, also? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3087.602s">Or</a> is that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3097.376s">So</a> you'd be using the front entrance and not the riverside. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3099.897s">And</a> that is your property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3102.058s">Also</a> that driveway that's there, that's currently goes all the way.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3118.085s">And</a> you're moving all your current equipment into that site.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3123.128s">And,</a> uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3124.713s">the</a> paint fumes and all that stuff that requires elevated stacks and so forth.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3143.024s">So</a> who actually governs that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3144.825s">Who</a> actually issues a permit for the painting? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3148.888s">Is</a> that a separate?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3152.487s">So</a> the building department and that has not been done as of yet.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3163.755s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3165.976s">I</a> wish you well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3819.536s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3820.437s">We</a> all know Magoon Park was done over less than a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3824.399s">And</a> all four basketball rims at the park, which the basketball court area was done magnificently. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3833.245s">Each</a> of the little eye loops that hold the net on are all broken off. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3838.687s">I</a> don't know if that's from hanging on the rim, or if it's intentionally done, but without the eye loops, you can't string a net, and it's not fun playing without a net on a basketball rim, I can tell you that firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3851.316s">So</a> I would ask that the Pac department go out there immediately and replace the rims at Magoon Pac on all four basketball rims.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3875.311s">We</a> did get a lot of time a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3877.011s">We</a> did get a lot of email traffic, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3879.712s">And</a> it's unfortunate that, uh, it's groundhog day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3883.273s">Once</a> again, in this community, we revisit the same issues over and over and over every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3889.253s">rather</a> than addressing them, creating meaningful policy to follow in this community, we just revisit the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3898.62s">It's</a> from August to September, April to May. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3902.082s">I</a> hate to isolate certain areas, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3905.565s">In</a> particular, up the hillside, it's when I get the phone calls and the emails that students start to put out mattresses on the sidewalks, old furniture, trash, debris, nothing in barrels at all, which we all know the new barrel program, they won't pick anything up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3921.798s">Mattresses</a> you have to call on, and they will come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3925.039s">And</a> I think we have to, in addition to stepping up code enforcement throughout the whole community, in particular in the Tufts neighborhood and all those streets, Mr. President, we have to do a better job in finding — it's tough to go after the students, but finding the property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3944.926s">You</a> know, once we start hitting the property owners in their pocket, they'll make sure that their tenants are abiding by the rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3951.868s">Also,</a> I think Tufts University has to do a better job in policing their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3957.251s">And</a> I don't want to say they're all tough students that are dumping, but in this particular area, there are a majority of students that do it every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3965.475s">This</a> is nothing new. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3966.716s">Every</a> year, we feel the phone calls and neighbors say, how would you like to look at a mattress that's been out there for three weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3973.039s">And</a> waste management won't pick it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3975.3s">The</a> city refuses to pick it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3977.381s">There's</a> TVs outside and curbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3980.222s">It</a> really is deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3981.976s">And</a> I wouldn't want this next to my house, and no resident should have to live like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=3986.159s">And</a> I would ask that the city administration create a policy, Mr. President, regarding illegal dumping, in particular in the Tufts neighborhood, the Tufts area, and code enforcement start to get out there <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4003.187s">and</a> start enforcing some of the rules and regulations that prohibit dumping on the sidewalk, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4020.093s">So</a> by finding them, that'll help one aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4022.794s">And</a> maybe we forget Barbara Rubel, who's the Tufts liaison to the city, help and sit down with this community on ways we can improve communication and have students abide by the rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4038.721s">And</a> you know, the one resident that mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4041.11s">Council</a> of Penta, for all his different resolutions, he offered a suggestion a few years ago about cleanup week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4048.685s">And</a> he said, why not have the city once or twice a week and <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4052.285s">once</a> or twice a year actually at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4054.428s">He</a> said, go out in trucks, let residents know you'll be in their neighborhood, and you can dump whatever you want in the back of our trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4062.636s">And</a> I thought it was a great solution to getting rid of some items that may be tough to get rid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4068.222s">And</a> that would probably be a great idea for the Tufts neighborhood to have trucks out there <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4073.988s">during</a> these times when they move in and when they move out, roaming the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4077.831s">You</a> know, it only improves our community and the quality of life of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4083.556s">So</a> I would offer that, Mr. President, also that the city look at the clean it week or two week or whatever it may be that was offered some time back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4093.825s">I</a> think it's a great suggestion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4247.525s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4248.986s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4249.346s">You</a> know, that's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4250.847s">And</a> it was back some probably five, six, seven years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4254.089s">We</a> had a great debate with Tufts University about asking them if we can get notification where students live off campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4262.014s">And</a> at the time, Mr. President, I don't know if anyone remembers that debate, but I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4265.857s">They</a> refused to give out any information on any student living off campus that let us know who was living on the Method side or the Somerville side in Tufts housing, but not off campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4276.607s">And</a> that was one of the reasons we were trying to address ways we can contact students and possibly update them if Tufts is not doing a good job about city codes and enforcement and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4288.61s">But</a> maybe we could try that process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4290.571s">But</a> they were adamant back some years ago they would not release.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4523.773s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4524.594s">Yes,</a> the electronic speeding sign that is located on High Street right before Brooks School, if you're going up towards the square, is not functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4535.696s">And</a> I know in this community, I'm hearing from a lot of different residents regarding pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4543.057s">And</a> these are the initiatives that this council has been pushing forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4547.152s">the</a> electronic speed signs, raised crosswalks, widening sidewalks, thermoplastic crosswalks, and it's disheartening when you see something that was put up recently that's not functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4560.6s">And</a> it's a real concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4563.843s">You</a> know, we've been talking about painted crosswalks, why we can't get them painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4568.908s">A</a> third of this year is already over, and our crosswalks are still not painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4575.333s">I'm</a> not sure, like, when do you do them? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4578.916s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4581.098s">You</a> know, and, you know, I <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4583.812s">It</a> seems sometimes they're done with chalk instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4586.513s">Well,</a> let me tell you, Mr. President, you know, I wrote an op-ed piece in the newspaper a couple of weeks ago regarding do you feel safe in your neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4597.096s">And</a> let me tell you, the comments that I was expecting to get, and I'm going to make a presentation before this council, but the comments I was expecting to get regarding break-ins and car break-ins and home invasions and so forth are not the comments I received. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4612.231s">It's</a> pedestrian safety comments over and over and over and over again throughout the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4619.716s">And</a> that's the feedback that I'm getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4621.457s">And</a> this council, and I can speak for myself and my colleagues, we've been pushing for pedestrian traffic calming initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4630.762s">And</a> for some reason, even when they do implement something, the sign breaks within a year or the crosswalk never gets repainted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4640.024s">You</a> know, these are basic things in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4644.148s">And,</a> you know, if there wasn't a fatality on this street of this community, I'd say, you know what, we're doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4650.434s">But</a> indeed, if you look over the past 15 to 20 years, there's been a number of fatalities on Method Roads in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4658.062s">And</a> not all of it's due to a lack of signage and faded crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4662.986s">But</a> let me tell you, <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4664.458s">It's</a> largely a part of the city not pushing forward initiatives like they do in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4669.982s">You</a> go on the Cambridge website, they have a whole section under their traffic division of traffic calming approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4678.348s">We</a> don't need to recreate the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4680.389s">We</a> can go and steal all their ideas, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4683.171s">They</a> hired consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4684.432s">They</a> went through thousands, tens of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4688.015s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4689.096s">We</a> have all this information in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4691.587s">And</a> for whatever reason, and I don't think it's funding, because where there's a will, there's a way, we just don't move forward on these initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4699.11s">We'll</a> create a bike path that leads to nowhere on a road, but we won't do the basic pedestrian traffic initiatives that need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4708.593s">And</a> I know that's a long way around this particular speeding sign being out, <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4713.505s">You</a> know, I took a bike ride Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4716.127s">And</a> let me tell you, Mr. President, walking, you probably see a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4720.07s">Bike</a> riding, you see a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4721.09s">When</a> you're in a car, you see very little. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4722.952s">You</a> drive by things and you don't recognize anything for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4726.274s">Maybe</a> it's tunnel vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4727.595s">But</a> let me tell you, a lot of the things that I noticed just driving my bike around was eye-opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4734.6s">And</a> maybe some of the city administration around here should take a bike ride and see what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4742.665s">But</a> that's all I have to offer, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4809.838s">Oh,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4811.468s">Just</a> if I could, because, you know, I read about the Complete Streets, and I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4816.352s">Some</a> of its funding, it might be yearly funding, or it might be funding that dries up after a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4822.897s">And</a> that's a great initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4824.439s">However,</a> the administration has to put forward policies and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4829.362s">In</a> particular, when we talked about thermoplastic crosswalks several weeks ago, when I offered for the fourth time a resolution that there be a policy created in our community <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4839.126s">that</a> doesn't paint crosswalks anymore, but uses the alternative, thermoplastic, which is highly reflective, slip-resistant, and lasts up to five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4847.893s">These</a> are the initiatives that you've got to create policy around. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4850.575s">It's</a> nice to get one-time fixes from the state, and it makes for a great picture in the newspaper, and a photo op, and a great story. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4858.501s">However,</a> long-term, it does nothing for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4861.904s">And</a> these are the initiatives I think we have to look at, and I just don't see it happening.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4902.316s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4903.697s">Every</a> year, residents from Woodruff Ave that abut the BJ's Fence call up in concern about the fence and the particular debris that blows up <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4915.832s">as</a> well as the overgrowth and weeds in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4920.317s">BJ's</a> committed back some years ago when they put a brand new fence along the whole perimeter to help with some of the noise reduction in the area, that they would also maintain both sides of the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4933.771s">I</a> know our DPW has been out there, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4935.843s">I</a> would once again ask that we send a correspondence to the manager at BJ's to get out there and clean the area along the fence, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o/2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=339.782s">Councilor</a> Martins. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=340.723s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=341.444s">So</a> when will the bulk of the work be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=344.206s">Will</a> it be done during the day or is this going to be... We're flexible.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=364.165s">Is</a> there any interruption to the traffic flow in the area?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=384.659s">Just</a> one lane of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=385.72s">So</a> you won't be able to go east or west at a certain period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=389.522s">or</a> one or the other?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=400.292s">So</a> on the other side, you'll have traffic on both ways?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=928.097s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=929.217s">And</a> this is a very wise resolution regarding the upkeep of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=937.938s">and</a> to hold the utility companies accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=941.081s">I</a> would suggest, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn mentioned, that over the last several years, we've struggled as a city because there's really no oversight on behalf of the city to represent the city, to make sure, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, that these jobs are being done up to our standards and according to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=963.898s">So</a> I would ask if Councilor Knight doesn't mind <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=966.87s">to</a> amend his resolution that we put a section in there that puts who the clerk of the work is on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=975.353s">So</a> at least, and there may not be someone, and that's the whole issue that we have, that there is no oversight, the clerk of the work for each job and each utility job, because someone here at City Hall has to sign off anytime a road is being broken into and so forth, excavated. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=993.979s">So</a> I would ask that we amend that <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=996.131s">to</a> put who is the clerk of the work on behalf of the city, for each of the projects.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1328.463s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1328.924s">In</a> addition to the crosswalk pedestrian crossing signage, neon signage is very important to alert people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1337.628s">There</a> is a crosswalk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1339.394s">Being</a> familiar with the area, I'm not sure exactly where the councilman wants to put the crosswalk, but I think if you put it close to the bridge, that may be a public safety concern, because coming from High Street down Grove, you're really cut off from visual at a great length. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1358.848s">But</a> when you're coming from... They have a mirror there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1360.749s">They</a> have a mirror there, but when you're coming down from Winchester, you have a long strip and you can actually see someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1366.353s">So</a> my suggestion would be to put the crosswalk <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1369.076s">further</a> down from the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1370.977s">So</a> if you're coming from Wellgate, you'd have to walk up Grove Street and then cross over. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1376.46s">I</a> think it adds a little bit more safety than having it too close to the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1379.621s">It's</a> an odd configuration of streets there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1381.642s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1419.633s">So</a> if you're coming up Bustle, you're saying?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1442.622s">That</a> way you have a line of vision both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1444.343s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1445.57s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1446.571s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1494.864s">I</a> think it would only be appropriate, whereas this council voted unanimously a couple of weeks ago to prompt the administration to use thermoplastic crosswalks rather than the traditional paint that fades after six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1510.317s">And</a> thermoplastic, we all know, is highly reflective and slip resistant and lasts up to five years, that this crosswalk be installed with thermoplastic <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1520.559s">So</a> the residents won't have to come six months from now saying, we can't see the faded crosswalk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1526.263s">So</a> I would amend if Councilor Caraviello would mind that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2052.105s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2054.288s">I</a> read an article in the Boston Globe back February 11th that talked about lead water pipes and the concern of lead water pipes in the Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2067.554s">And</a> I think the article was a result of Flint, Michigan. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2071.776s">And</a> we all know the disaster that took place in Flint. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2074.938s">And</a> the article went on to report that there are a number of communities that still have a high percentage of lead lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2084.14s">And</a> it listed the city of Malden having 47% of their total service lines in the city as lead lines, which is a very high percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2094.326s">And</a> then it went on to say the city of Medford has 28%, which was the second highest. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2100.49s">And</a> this is in the MWRA district. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2102.411s">It's</a> not statewide, but is in the MWRA district. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2105.893s">And</a> I found that number to be, in my own opinion, very excessive, knowing that the city went through <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2113.8s">change</a> back in 2004 when they created a policy to try to address lead service lines in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2121.582s">So</a> I did a little research into it, Mr. President, but the reason why I bring this up tonight is to draw awareness to residents that may have a lead line still connected, to report on the fact and not what was reported in the Boston Globe, which listed Method as the second highest. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2141.268s">And</a> I don't believe, according to my <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2143.239s">facts</a> and figures, we are the second highest in the MWRA district of lead lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2148.723s">And</a> also to let residents know that there may be some solutions to a very costly replacement of a lead line, which could run $3,000 to $5,000 to remove a line. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2161.733s">So</a> if your home was built prior to 1940, which many of our homes in this community were built prior, I know I live in a home that was built prior to 1940, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2172.429s">your</a> house most likely has a lead service line. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2176.25s">And</a> there are standards that were created that allows for a certain percentage of lead to exist within someone's bloodstream. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2187.494s">However,</a> for infants and young children, it could be very dangerous, even low, low levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2194.176s">And</a> what I found out, Mr. President, is that Medford has roughly 14,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2201.485s">water</a> service lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2204.005s">And</a> according to the MWRA, 28% of those, or 3,920, are made of lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2213.167s">And</a> after talking to Ron Baker in our water department, who's a very astute person when it comes to water in this community, he mentioned to me that, and he sent me a list, and I can provide that to members of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2229.389s">In</a> 2004, the city started with a lead replacement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2234.352s">And</a> their hope was every year that they would reduce that by 7%. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2239.015s">And</a> I don't know if they met the quarter every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2242.118s">I</a> didn't go through the exact numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2244.119s">But</a> from 2005, fiscal year 2005 to 2015, the city has replaced 1,768 lead lines in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2257.839s">And</a> when I say they replaced, meaning that when a resident calls up and says, I'd like to, you know, they hire a contractor, get rid of my lead line, the lead line comes out to the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2270.943s">And</a> then the city has another portion that leads to the main in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2275.525s">So</a> there may be another six or eight feet that the city's responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2279.886s">So</a> the city keeps track of what they've done on their end through these figures, and they have reported 1,768 <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2287.922s">changes</a> in lead lines since 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2291.723s">So</a> if you look at the figures now, according to what Ron Baker provided me, and I would assume the Globe that wrote this article on February 11th would have updated information when they're reporting, there currently exist roughly 2,232 lead lines in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2310.567s">And</a> this is a rough estimate, but it's a very close estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2314.307s">And</a> that is only 16% of the total <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2317.915s">service</a> lines in the community, not 28 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2320.717s">That's</a> almost 1,200 lead lines off in that article. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2325.86s">So</a> I wanted to report the facts, at least I've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2329.782s">And</a> if anyone wants to dispute that, I'd be more than happy to sit down and discuss what I found out on this information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2339.849s">And,</a> you know, when you look at what we received from the MWRA, it's virtually lead-free. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2347.64s">So</a> our water comes, for the most part, from the Quab and Rez. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2351.021s">It's</a> through steel pipes, concrete pipes, iron pipes, comes over to the city of Medford, might travel some 25, 30, 40 miles in piping, and then it comes up to your home, and if you have a lead line, from eight feet into your house, lead can leach into your water. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2371.864s">So</a> it travels 30 miles lead-free, it gets up to your home, and guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2377.067s">Your</a> eight-foot connection to the main could be putting you at risk for lead poisoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2385.49s">And</a> it's a major concern, especially, as I mentioned, for young children and infants. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2392.212s">However,</a> there is some helpful hints in your cold water, as reported in the paper, which was helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2400.354s">I</a> think they were accurate on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2402.215s">If</a> you run your cold water a few minutes, it takes any of the leaching that <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2406.435s">If</a> the water's been sitting there a while in your cold lead pipes, it takes any of that and cuts it out in the drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2412.857s">So</a> you let that run for a little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2415.218s">And</a> the city of Boston, and I'm not proposing this tonight, but the city of Boston for their residents offers financing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2424.24s">So</a> if you have a hardship and you say, geez, I can't afford this time to spend $3,000 to $5,000 to replace my lead line, although I have three infants in my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2433.997s">and</a> I'm very concerned, they do offer a financing program. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2439.741s">My</a> motion tonight, Mr. President, is to have the water department create a list of lead service lines that they're aware of, they may not be aware of every single one, but they're aware of, and notify residents of a lead connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2457.434s">So</a> I think it would be a very helpful PR that the city of Medford, we receive so many <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2463.568s">confirmations</a> and calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2465.909s">If</a> I was a homeowner, I'd like to know, I may not be astute and realize that I have a lead line coming into my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2471.37s">I'd</a> like to know if the city of Medford thinks I have a lead line for my own sense of peace and knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2480.253s">And</a> so that would be the first resolution that I offer motion is the city contact those that may have a lead line for notification, nothing else but notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2492.097s">And</a> also that <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2493.735s">The</a> MWRA, if we can get a report back from the MWRA, whether or not there's any way that they can assist residents in the replacement of lead lines, if there's any funding available. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2508.465s">I</a> know the city takes advantage of roughly a million dollars a year in 0% finance loans through the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2516.691s">And</a> would any of that apply to residents that may have a concern with lead <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2523.697s">in</a> their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2524.898s">There's</a> also lead testing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2527.239s">The</a> way I understand it, it's done randomly in every city and town in the MWRA district. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2533.543s">So</a> they may pick a few homes throughout the community, do lead testing, and report on that particular testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2541.188s">But</a> if anyone has a concern or believe that they may have, for whatever reason, high quantities of lead, they should be able to contact the Method Water Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2553.346s">and</a> find out more information on where they can get some lead testing done, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2559.409s">And</a> this is all — I don't want to alarm people, but I think it's only important that people are aware of some of the concerns, some of the health concerns with lead and ways that they may be able to combat the lead on their own by running the faucet and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2577.497s">And</a> again, the MWRA provides this water to us from 30 miles out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2584.173s">I</a> remember a while back, someone made a presentation when we were talking about water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2589.996s">And</a> it was, I remember at the time, and it's still stuck in my head, to deliver a gallon of water from the Corbin Res to your home of fresh drinking water, it's roughly one penny in cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2603.223s">Now,</a> the sewer may be a different pot. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2605.584s">You</a> know, the sewer may have a different cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2608.205s">But</a> to deliver, it's one penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2610.907s">And</a> I just find that amazing, especially with <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2613.904s">the</a> job that the MWRA is doing to provide clean drinking water to our residents so we don't have a Flint, Michigan in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2622.927s">So</a> those two offerings of motions I would offer tonight, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2776.398s">If</a> you happen to go into your basement and see where the water's coming in from outside, the lead line is usually like a brownish, greenish color almost. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2789.024s">But</a> you can actually see the line coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2790.945s">It</a> may not come in too deep into the house, but you can actually see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2795.267s">Someone</a> knowing the difference between pipes, copper, lead, should be able to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2800.37s">And</a> I think on your deed itself, or I know when we bought our house, I think it mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2805.938s">you</a> know, like it says you have a paid driveway, you have asphalt shingles. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2809.761s">I</a> think it also said you have a lead line or copper line or, you know, two 20 electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2815.104s">I</a> think it did mention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2816.125s">So</a> that might be another way of, of also checking. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2819.187s">And</a> then hopefully if we can get the city to go through their records, uh, you know, they should be able to give us an accurate assessment.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4179.154s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4180.135s">I</a> want to thank Mr. Capucci for bringing this topic up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4184.036s">It's</a> a very important topic, and we know the old administration under Mayor McGlynn was anti-public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4193.719s">I</a> still can't figure out why, but for many years, that administration did everything they could to stop public access in this community, but still maintained <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4204.795s">the</a> funding through franchise fees that we were all paying for PEG, government, public, and educational access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4213.923s">This</a> current mayor now appointed many committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4217.906s">I</a> know, Mr. President, you chair the Business and Economic Committee, or co-chair, and I know there were recommendations just made by the Constituent Service Committee after having several public hearings in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4231.534s">And</a> after hearing from residents, the main theme of their report was, we need more transparency in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4240.577s">And</a> I find it ironic that the one thing that really would bring some great change in this community, and it's not a solve-all by any means, but government access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4252.537s">Community</a> access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4254.318s">Those</a> are the initiatives, I think, that as a government, we're obligated to let people voice their opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4262.664s">And</a> I remember the good old days when they used to televise Medford High football games. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4268.127s">And</a> they used to televise the parade live. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4270.569s">And</a> they used to have talk shows on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4272.65s">And</a> they used to bring up current events in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4276.259s">And</a> they'd have a cooking show, and they'd have other shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4279.841s">It</a> was just a great way of uniting the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4283.024s">And</a> I'm hoping this new administration practice what they preach in transparency and brings back local community access, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4293.01s">We're</a> paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4295.532s">There's</a> a need in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4297.693s">People</a> want to have access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4299.835s">I</a> hear it over and over again, and I'm not sure why it takes so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4305.302s">to</a> get access after creating committees to advise the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4310.185s">We've</a> been there, done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4311.386s">The</a> Judge Jackson report, we've been there, done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4315.029s">Now</a> we want access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4317.431s">So</a> I agree with the speaker and I'm hoping this administration, I know Mayor Burke has a lot on her plate, but I too would like to hear more about community access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4329.059s">I</a> read the article in the first 100 days and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4332.321s">There's</a> been some change in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4335.008s">some</a> initiatives that this administration has offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4338.07s">But</a> some of the meat and potato issues, I still want to hear about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4342.573s">And</a> this community access has been an albatross around the city's neck for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4350.058s">And</a> I think we need to address it, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5394.048s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5399.01s">I</a> thank a council of Penta for, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5401.725s">bringing</a> up this important subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5405.426s">I</a> agree also with the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5407.007s">I</a> think the high school, although the building is currently underutilized right now and does have the capacity to take on public access and a portion of the building, I think having the building, don't forget the last two community access stations were in the square and they were there for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5427.892s">They</a> were there for a reason because of its location. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5430.448s">and</a> it's easy access into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5433.549s">And</a> I think the library is one possible item. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5439.391s">I</a> think Springstep, you know, we all talk about Springstep and we'd love to have Springstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5444.373s">It's</a> a stone throw from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5446.574s">The</a> building itself is made for the performance and the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5451.456s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello mentioned about having it an art center slash possibly <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5460.548s">community</a> cable would be a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5465.61s">And,</a> you know, I remember back some 10 years ago, maybe even a little longer, Mr. President, you probably remember, when we were looking at merging the yachts and the community access at the Swan building, the Swan School. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5478.894s">And</a> it missed by one vote of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5481.655s">We</a> almost had that come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5483.775s">And</a> I think that's a great marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5485.596s">And</a> I think it would have worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5487.096s">The</a> Springstep building is ideal for <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5489.95s">for</a> that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5491.571s">It's</a> centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5493.312s">It</a> steps from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5494.853s">There's</a> ample parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5496.614s">And</a> really, I don't see why, if I were the mayor, I'd be on the phone with the owner of that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5505.079s">Mr.</a> President, from what I hear, they're looking to unload that building, and they haven't been too successful because of the setup of the building is conducive to arts and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5517.347s">I</a> think that would be a great addition to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5519.681s">So</a> I think what the gentleman at the podium, Councilor Penter, is offering is just another alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5525.562s">You</a> know, I, as one member, and I've stated this loud and clear, I don't want to see our high school used for anything else than its intended purpose to educate our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5536.265s">And</a> in this day and age, with everything that's going on, in my opinion, the least number of people we have up there that aren't students and teachers, the better off and the safer we're going to be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5548.158s">And</a> that's a whole other discussion for another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5550.438s">But</a> I don't want to see that building opened up, even though it may be one separate door and at a certain end. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5557.22s">I</a> don't want to see it opened up for anything other than its intended purpose, which is to educate our children, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5564.601s">So</a> I thank Councilor Penta for offering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5567.141s">I</a> look forward to hearing back on Councilor Knight's motion to see if the library could be used for any other purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5575.203s">I</a> didn't realize there was a <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5576.519s">a</a> deed restriction on that if there is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5578.86s">And</a> you know what, several weeks ago, we had the issue of the Hegner Center before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5584.141s">I</a> mean, here's a small building in the city that could be used for local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5589.663s">It</a> might not be centrally as located as we like, but that may be a great addition if it comes back in the city coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5597.605s">And</a> the one thing Councilor Penta mentioned is when you have a space that you're paying for, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5602.987s">when</a> you're paying $1,500 or $2,000 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5606.75s">A</a> lion's share of your money goes to housing, community access, and not towards programming and hiring the people to get it up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5616.038s">And</a> if it wasn't a city building, I think a lot of that money could be put towards programming and hiring the right people to run the access station, rather than on the physical property itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5629.389s">So</a> that's a great point that Councilor Penta mentioned.<h2><a href="../2016-04-13_RZGyI63vqfU/2016-04-13_RZGyI63vqfU.html">Medford, MA City Council

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=313.467s">She's</a> answered them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=315.388s">I</a> am in opposition of this paper.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=327.85s">And</a> I want to explain my position, why I'm opposed to this, for the fact that... <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=333.46s">The</a> city went out and hired a consultant to come in and provide the city with facts and figures on what it would cost to remove the contaminants at the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=346.11s">And</a> to be off by $500,000 on a project that was originally estimated at, what was the amount?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=354.696s">It</a> was about $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=355.036s">So</a> they were off by $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=355.857s">So</a> the project ended up costing us <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=363.258s">A</a> million dollars, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=365.64s">And</a> I'm not sure, would we pay this outside consultant?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=375.91s">So</a> we paid $150,000 to an outside consultant to ask or to let us know what it was going to cost to remove the contaminants. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=383.477s">They</a> said $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=385.202s">We</a> started the project, it was closer to $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=388.463s">So</a> we lost $500,000 on that and we paid $150,000 for a consultant that gave us bogus information. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=396.187s">So</a> it's actually $650,000 in net, which I have a real problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=403.23s">And</a> I realize that the remedial treatment of what was under there may have differed based on what they found and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=414.887s">I</a> have a tough time thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=418.429s">It's</a> almost like being a meteorologist. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=420.53s">You</a> could be right 50% of the time, and you're doing a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=425.452s">And</a> I don't understand why we'd pay a consultant to come in over $100,000 and be off by 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=432.595s">It</a> just doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=437.577s">And</a> for those particular reasons, I cannot support this particular funding <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=443.524s">for</a> the cleanup, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=334.42s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=337.214s">Councilor</a> Caraviello is right, I think it was about two years ago I offered a resolution and it was based actually on the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=345.438s">The</a> city of Somerville has a program that the city will have, whether it's a private owner or a public building, they will have the owner sign a waiver form. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=358.965s">And</a> if the owner is unable to remove the graffiti based on financial means, the city will step in, as long as there's no liability from this waiver, and they'll remove the graffiti off the side of a home or a building and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=373.799s">I</a> think the one thing that I emphasized two years ago was that if I happen to own a business in the square and someone comes up and tags the whole side of my building, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=384.628s">And</a> then the city, the next day, knocks on my door and says, if you don't remove this graffiti, we're going to start fining you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=391.772s">I</a> think that adds insult to injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=396.295s">The</a> business owner, really, by no fault of their own, was tagged by someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=404.281s">It's</a> a hardship first of all, and that could be for any property owner too. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=407.922s">That</a> could be your house, my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=409.742s">If</a> someone comes up and spray paints the side of my house, I may not have the means to have that removed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=415.664s">And</a> I think the city of Somerville offers a great service to the residents of the community to allow that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=423.846s">And</a> I believe it was two years ago that I asked that we be able to do our own graffiti removal rather than rely on, right now, the Middlesex County Sheriff's Office <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=433.848s">does</a> a bulk of our graffiti removal within the community, upon request. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=439.453s">So,</a> I'm not sure what the machinery costs, but I think it's worthwhile looking into. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=445.297s">It's</a> similar to what Councilor Falco offered not too recently about the plowing of the sidewalks, Councilor Scarpelli about the Porter Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=455.266s">and</a> other initiatives in the community that I believe as a community this size, we should be offering, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=462.815s">So</a> I would ask my council colleague, if you wouldn't mind amending it, asking through his resolution, once again, that the city administration look into buying the equipment for removal, because again, I want to stress <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=476.219s">I'm</a> not in favor of going out and just start fining people that were under the unfortunate circumstance of having graffiti sprayed all over their building or whatever it might be, your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=488.502s">And</a> I'm more in favor of having the city have an option that frees us from any liability that will remove graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=497.705s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Falco and Councilor, what's your name again? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=506.925s">Caraviello,</a> Councilor Caraviello, Mr. President, that, you know, the more you leave the graffiti out there, it's like the old broken window concept, and it creates more broken windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=519.131s">So</a> I agree we have to clean it up, but I just don't agree with going after the business owner or the homeowner if they're financially strapped, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=635.473s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=636.534s">I'll</a> just speak briefly on this because I have a resolution under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=641.696s">However,</a> I did receive an email from a gentleman in the community that just used <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=646.671s">the</a> C-Click Fix website and he reported graffiti on the Route 16 West sign and it's spray painted with all black spray paint on it and he used C-Click Fix and he got a response back within minutes <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=665.307s">saying</a> thank you very much for reporting your issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=668.19s">However,</a> that road is operated by DCR and here's the phone number to DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=674.455s">And</a> I'm not sure my opinion of C-Click Fix is if you bring an issue to the city, they should work on that issue on behalf of the resident and not just give the resident a phone number to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=688.347s">Whether</a> it's a state road or a city road, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=691.588s">That</a> should be the resident alerting the city of what needs to take place and then the city taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=697.532s">But</a> I'll speak to that in a later.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=708.04s">I'd</a> rather keep that, but where Councilor Falco was talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=712.163s">where</a> it's such in vague form. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=714.204s">Other</a> places that need graffiti removal, I would also add the Route 16 West sign entering Method now says, Ernie Me Moomy, because you can't read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=729.369s">So</a> I would ask that that be done, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=953.334s">Mr.</a> President, we have a president here who'd like to speak.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1062.838s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1064.838s">Just</a> recently, within the tax bills, there was a letter sent out by the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1072.059s">explaining</a> the recently passed Community Preservation Act for FY17, fiscal year 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1082.322s">And</a> it goes on to state what the Community Preservation Act is, the amount of surcharge, which is 1.5% surcharge on your property tax bill, and for what purposes this money could be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1098.697s">And</a> the fact that I know there was an ad hoc committee chaired by Councilor Knight that is working on creating an ordinance to govern the four members that will serve on this board, as well as some other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1114.283s">And</a> the one thing that this letter did not explain, and I received several calls to date, is the fact that there is an exemption for seniors and low-income residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1128.733s">And</a> there's no mention within the letter made of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1132.474s">I</a> know Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought this up last week about how do you apply for this and who is eligible and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1143.417s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate that now we're going to be hitting up residents and their tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1150.279s">We</a> should equally let them know that there is an exemption available. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1156.538s">and</a> who to contact, what is the maximum and low income requirements, what are the qualifications, the household size, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1168.184s">So</a> I would ask again that the administration provide, because I'm not sure if the committee has any, the ad hoc committee has any whereabouts with this particular function of the exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1182.192s">I</a> know it's created under state law, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1184.271s">But</a> I'm sure there's a due date to file for an exemption, and I'm sure the law currently spells out, which I have a copy in front of me, the maximum and low income levels that would apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1200.078s">It</a> says income is, it's only based on your income and not assets. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1205.02s">So</a> that's very important, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1207.181s">Not</a> everyone can afford to pay this additional surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1213.142s">And</a> I think it's only appropriate if it's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1215.743s">And</a> this is what was stated by the proponents during the last election, when this was a ballot question, that there will be an exemption, that we also promote the exemption to let people know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1229.507s">And</a> for those people that are eligible, that they sign up and make sure they take advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1234.909s">So</a> I just want to make sure that it's out there and that we get a response from <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1239.244s">uh,</a> the city administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1252.872s">I</a> won't repeat my comments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1257.215s">However,</a> the, um, newly created C click fix program, which this council, uh, actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1265.736s">is</a> on record, uh, originally asking back three or four years that the city implement this program is now up and functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1274.938s">And,</a> um, I was under the impression that, uh, residents, this would make it easier for residents through electronic means to get ahold of the city and to accomplish getting, um, uh, results, uh, on behalf of residents and, um, dismayed to hear that a resident already, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1295.628s">used</a> this particular program and was told that they should contact the state to do away with some graffiti that's on a City Welcome to the City of Method sign that's in our city but maybe falls on a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1312.319s">And</a> I think that's, to me, what this whole process is supposed to be set up for is to help residents in their search <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1324.337s">to</a> get results of this community and not to pass the buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1327.079s">So</a> I would ask that we ask the administration that, um, in what regards will residents be asked to make contact outside entities, outside agencies, um, and, uh, should that be the responsibility of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1346.951s">Whereas</a> they use and see click fix to report something directly to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1352.347s">And</a> I think it should fall under their scope of work to be done, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1936.568s">Thank</a> you, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1938.028s">You</a> just referred to a second set of turn out gear.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1942.01s">Um,</a> it was, uh, I believe two years ago, uh, during budget that a second set of, uh, turnout gear was actually made a promise by then mayor McGlynn, uh, to supply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1956.961s">Why</a> have we not seen this? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1958.082s">I</a> asked this, I believe it was two weeks ago, and I was told that we went into great detail about the need, first of all, for a second set of turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1969.972s">The</a> fact that many, especially the newcomers, some of the old timers had two sets, but many of the newcomers didn't have a second set. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1980.881s">Why</a> are we at this point where we don't have a second set?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2033.677s">Yeah,</a> the whole issue was surrounding a second set of gear and many of the firefighters had a concern that they'll go out and they'll be in a fire and then they have to wear the same gear that they just were in a fire with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2046.727s">So</a> just off the top you had what percentage of the firefighters now don't have a second assigned to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2052.531s">I'm</a> not talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2053.717s">one</a> assigned to a station, assigned to firefighters?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2071.336s">So</a> what percent is that of the force?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2086.876s">So</a> you're saying currently, right now, there's only 20 people that don't have a second set assigned to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2092.438s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2105.551s">Okay,</a> and the walkie-talkies, how are the walkie-talkies working? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2109.855s">Communication?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2110.856s">Radios?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2112.017s">I</a> don't have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2114.119s">There's</a> no issue, there's no issue with the towers, there's no issue with the... No, no, please, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2119.043s">So</a> everything's been working fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2120.824s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2122.766s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2123.647s">And</a> any need for new trucks?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2132.653s">I</a> saw yesterday in the snowstorm, uh, the old fire pickup truck going around salt in the streets.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2152.222s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2152.402s">But</a> that was his truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2153.183s">I've</a> never seen it out salt in the streets.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2162.707s">So</a> it's not one of your vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2164.009s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2165.69s">Even</a> though it says fight department on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2170.074s">Thank</a> you, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2170.794s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2216.397s">Before</a> we read the records, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2219.758s">Longtime</a> Method resident and Method High School Spanish teacher, who we all know, Mrs. Lepore, just received the Mustang Spirit Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2229.941s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2231.101s">Any</a> time that you receive an award, not only from your peers, but from students, I think says a lot about the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2238.263s">And</a> Mrs. Lepore has been an advisor for the Foreign Language Club for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2243.204s">She's</a> been a Spanish teacher for over 20 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2246.585s">and</a> also organizes the trips to Puerto Rico, Spain, Mexico, Cuba, and does a great job.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2255.874s">In</a> Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2257.055s">And</a> I wish her well in her future endeavors and also want to congratulate her on this prestigious award.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2385.861s">Mr.</a> President, before we end the meeting.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2394.588s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2396.61s">Myself</a> and Councilor Caraviello had the opportunity last week to attend the first meeting of a new neighborhood crime watch group in West Medford at the Shiloh Baptist Church. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2409.879s">And</a> there were probably over 100 residents there, and it was well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2415.063s">And</a> members of Medford's finest, the police department, were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2419.886s">And</a> there were many concerns from area residents <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2422.618s">As</a> we all know, there's been a rash of home break-ins in the West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2428.242s">And</a> according to the police department, since January, I'm sorry, I think it was March 15th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2438.708s">Counsel,</a> do you remember how many break-ins there were altogether? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2441.95s">There</a> were 12 break-ins with a number of them in the West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2446.874s">So</a> residents are concerned on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2449.382s">ways</a> they can help assist the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2453.385s">There</a> was also a lot of discussion in bringing back community policing, which everyone behind this rail I think supports wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2462.432s">And</a> I know there's another meeting coming up soon about creating a crime watch group that will actually go out and walk the neighborhood and be the eyes and ears of the police department and also have a network where residents can notify each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2478.284s">And</a> I'm hoping that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2479.778s">this</a> will spring to other parts of the city so we can now communicate from Wellington to North Method to Salt to West Method to the hillside and allow all these particular groups to network and assist the police in doing their job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2496.67s">But</a> I want to thank the residents that turned out that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2503.754s">It</a> was a great showing and there were a lot of concerns about issues taking place in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2509.745s">And,</a> um, uh, I, I recommended when I spoke that, uh, if, uh, the residents would like to come up to the council meeting and speak before the council and some of the concerns they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2523.356s">I</a> know I've been asking for, I think it's three years now to have a public safety summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2529.862s">And</a> I look back at some of my old records. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2532.984s">Council</a> Penta wasn't the only one to keep records for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2535.947s">I</a> look back at some of my old records. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2537.982s">And</a> I found a resolution back, it was three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2541.284s">And</a> at the time, there was a rash of robberies in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2544.385s">And</a> I think there was 87 house break-ins back some three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2549.007s">And</a> I asked for a public safety summit to sit down with the elected officials, sit down with public safety, and see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2556.211s">And</a> to date, I have yet to get a call from Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2559.652s">I</a> have yet to get a call from anyone from the administration about setting up a public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2565.997s">And</a> I know you said you were going to work on setting something up, Mr. President, but this is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2573.083s">You</a> know, when people feel like they're being followed, you know, when people are going to church and people know when they're going to church and their house gets robbed, that's a concern in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2583.811s">And</a> when the police department states that this may be part of a ring that's operating in Brookline and some other communities, you know, of robberies, that's a major concern in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2595.118s">And</a> I just don't feel the outcry, to be quite honest with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2597.98s">I</a> have to be frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2599.241s">I</a> don't feel the outcry from public safety officials in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2604.004s">And</a> when residents say, you know, I don't see police coming up and down my street, and a police officer says, well, ma'am, you're not at your door seven days a week, 24 hours a day, I think that's a lousy answer to give a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2617.194s">I</a> really think that's a lousy answer to give a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2619.749s">So,</a> I think we have to do more, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2623.592s">And</a> maybe this could be a shot across the bow to the administration, as well as this council, to set this public safety forum up so we can welcome residents and public safety officials to have a discussion and dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2639.102s">There's</a> nothing wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2640.563s">That's</a> healthy to discuss issues that we may be having in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2645.086s">I</a> thank you for the time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2726.068s">On</a> the motion of counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2726.748s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2730.271s">You</a> triggered something off in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2732.973s">One</a> of the other issues that were brought up that night was residents were asking, well, why don't we see more police on the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2739.178s">Why</a> don't we see more visual patrols around? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2742.96s">And</a> they were told that due to budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2746.143s">So</a> right away, myself and Rick were the only elected officials in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2751.026s">And</a> the meeting turned to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2753.708s">And</a> I couldn't explain budget cuts for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2757.553s">All</a> I know is for the last 20 years, taxes have been going up in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2762.396s">There's</a> been no budget cuts that I know of directly within the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2767.939s">You</a> know, they should be calling for a list every year that this council has been asking to increase the manpower, but it's not due to budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2775.784s">It's</a> due to priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2777.445s">And</a> if the police department had a priority of community policing, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2781.668s">and</a> bringing back police on bicycles and motorcycles and maybe even foot patrol in certain areas, that would be the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2788.95s">So</a> the excuse of budget cuts in the police department, I just don't buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2793.692s">And</a> also the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2797.203s">It</a> was a year and a half ago when the administration, as well as this council, voted to take a bulk of the responsibilities from the police department of ticketing, which is a major job, away from the police department, although they still have responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2814.213s">That</a> was supposed to be to free them up to do these other activities, to make sure that they're out there and they're doing the networking, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2822.536s">in</a> community policing, and not give them the menial stuff of going out tagging. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2828.501s">And</a> I don't see a difference, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2831.403s">So</a> these are the things I think we have to sit down at a table and discuss, because the residents have every right to say, well, budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2839.97s">What's</a> being cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2840.65s">My</a> taxes are going up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2842.881s">The</a> administration, everything's going up around this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2846.103s">What</a> are we talking about cuts? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2847.823s">Who's</a> cutting the police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2849.244s">It's</a> not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2850.585s">I</a> haven't asked for cuts in the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2853.606s">And</a> I don't see that as an excuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2856.908s">If</a> the levels are low, the administration should be asking us every year when the chief comes before us, I need men, I need more boots on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2865.252s">I</a> need women and men on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2868.213s">And</a> then this council can act. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2870.154s">Or</a> then this council can make recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2872.601s">It's</a> the same with cruises. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2874.522s">I</a> mean, you're talking about police cruises that have 90, 100, 120,000 miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2879.304s">They're</a> running seven days a week, 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2882.985s">That</a> should be an automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2884.086s">Every</a> budget, there should be five or six cruises that are put on in the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2891.149s">That's</a> just a part of operating a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2893.59s">And</a> to me, we're falling short of the mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2896.631s">And</a> some of the excuses we're coming up with now, with budget cuts and lack of manning, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2901.45s">To</a> me, you know, residents aren't going to buy this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2904.032s">And</a> we need to sit down and discuss these issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2910.055s">Ma'am.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3184.512s">Sharon</a> brings up a great point, and I think a reverse 9-1-1 call would be adequate, especially to target certain areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3192.673s">With</a> that system, it has the capability of you can notify particular neighborhoods, streets, wards, precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3200.095s">You</a> can notify whatever section you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3201.815s">And</a> to me, that would be the intent of the reverse 9-1-1, to allow, when there was a rash of robberies in West Medford, they called the West Medford area and failed to call other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3214.153s">And</a> in my opinion, if there's robberies in one section of the city, I think the whole entire city should be on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3221.741s">Because</a> robbers are smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3223.383s">They're</a> not going to stay in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3225.225s">They're</a> going to move to a different section of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3228.669s">So</a> I think we could use the 911 for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3231.852s">But</a> that's a great comment.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_7nvtKAs6nf0/2025-03-21_7nvtKAs6nf0.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 29, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=19.548s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=71.766s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=73.966s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=75.187s">And</a> I know many other members of <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=77.485s">This</a> council have offered this same resolution over the past several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=83.449s">Our</a> streets are getting worse and worse as the days go by. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=89.093s">It's</a> really no longer pothole patrol now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=91.914s">I</a> think it's a complete street repair for many of our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=96.297s">And</a> I asked back some several months ago that there be done a complete audit of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=103.762s">And</a> I have yet to see any response from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=107.377s">However,</a> I do see potholes being filled here and there, but clearly it's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=113.639s">All</a> you need to do is go down any of the major roads in the city and you'll see it littered with potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=121.901s">And</a> secondary roads are equally as bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=124.982s">And</a> I think with money coming in from what we heard recently that the city is combining with the state, with this complete streets grant program, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=135.297s">that</a> we should be receiving some funding shortly that that be earmarked for street replacement, as well as pothole improvement throughout the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=148.464s">And</a> actually throughout the city, but actually throughout the commonwealth, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=152.506s">But</a> in particular, this city is in very bad shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=156.948s">And</a> I would ask that we receive, Mr. President, a complete rundown and assessment of the current conditions <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=164.787s">of</a> all our city streets and also recommendations by the administration on what we're going to do, Mr. President, because I realize that our streets are old, and after the frost of the winter and after the plows go up and down our streets, it creates gullies and potholes and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=183.997s">But</a> there has to be a better way of approaching our streets, seven square miles of road in this city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=193.745s">We</a> have to be more proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=195.505s">And</a> maybe we should have a hotline like the city of the Boston has, um, with, uh, calling in, um, uh, complaints to a hotline that's dedicated for potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=205.268s">Uh,</a> and I know the city's moving forward with the C click fix program, which, uh, this council has been pushing for, for a number of years, but maybe a program dedicated to, uh, just potholes in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=219.352s">And</a> that way we could have, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=221.167s">thousands</a> of residents be our eyes and ears in the community and alert city officials, in particular the DPW, that there are potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=230.47s">And</a> some of these potholes, Mr. President, I took a number of pictures on my phone, and I'll pass them around if people want to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=237.152s">Some</a> of them are six, eight, 12 inches deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=240.933s">So</a> it's not just a small hole now, but you can have front-end damage, tire damage, accidents, and, you know, trip and fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=250.712s">There's</a> a lot of circumstances that these potholes create throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=256.335s">A</a> couple of weeks ago I mentioned about catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=258.917s">I</a> would ask any one of my council colleagues to take a ride around the city and I guarantee you on every street you go down you're going to see a catch basin, not a sewer, a catch basin that along the curbs <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=271.651s">You're</a> going to see them collapsing inwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=275.032s">And</a> you're going to find these on almost every street throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=278.514s">And</a> it's prolific. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=279.454s">And</a> we have a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=281.575s">A</a> pothole, you can throw a little tire in and then move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=284.296s">When</a> you have a collapsed catch basin, that's a very big concern in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=288.978s">And</a> don't forget, the catch basins are used to cut off rain runoff water into the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=294.68s">So</a> they serve a purpose for flooding and other issues in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=298.602s">And</a> if we neglect these for years and years, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=301.175s">in</a> years and not use the $8 million we have in surplus to address water and sewer surplus to address some of these issues, we're going to have some grave concerns in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=312.182s">And</a> I don't know what it's going to take, Mr. President, but I think what we're seeing right now is that it's becoming overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=318.306s">And</a> we had the DPW Commissioner, Brian Kerins, the acting DPW Commissioner, at a meeting several weeks back, and I posed the question to him, and he agreed that this is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=330.307s">And</a> many of these, uh, catch basins, uh, have been neglected over the years and now we're going to pay the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=337.191s">And,</a> uh, you know, I'm hoping maybe with, uh, some of this complete street program grant money, we can address the potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=344.295s">I'm</a> hoping we can address crosswalks, which I have another resolution on next. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=349.218s">And</a> I'm hoping we can address some of the catch basin issues that we have, uh, Mr. President, as well as, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=355.334s">You</a> know, no one wants to talk about the water and sewer infrastructure, as well as our sewer infrastructure, which is costing ratepayers about 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=363.98s">If</a> you look at your sewer bill, about 50% of it is through I&I, inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=371.206s">The</a> water seeping into our older sewer pipes, it's being carted out to Deer Island, and it's being treated as raw sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=378.171s">All</a> it is is rain, runoff water, and it's costing about 50% to the ratepayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=384.574s">on</a> their, on their sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=386.516s">And,</a> you know, unless we can start tackling these issues, realigning some of our hotspots we have in the community, which we have countless reports in, uh, in the, uh, um, the engineering office, uh, from studies that were done in the past to alert us where these hotspots are, uh, that are accepting groundwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=407.613s">and</a> the city has done very little to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=410.417s">They've</a> done some stuff, but very little to nothing on obtaining 0% finance loans from the MWRA and also using our own surplus, which the intent of our surplus is there for, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=424.393s">particular</a> projects, and these projects would all be infrastructure improvements and would also eventually reduce some of the rates that we're paying in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=435.696s">People</a> always ask me, well, how are we going to get a hold of our water and sewer rates? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=439.937s">One</a> of them is to have a systematic long-term approach to addressing these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=446.199s">And</a> we have yet to create anything in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=449.247s">You</a> know, because it's underground, you can see what we do with our buildings that are above ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=453.73s">We</a> neglect them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=454.671s">You</a> can imagine these sewer pipes that are 90, 100 years old underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=458.934s">The</a> city is paying no attention to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=461.476s">And</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=462.897s">The</a> ratepayers in this community are paying for that lack of attention over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=467.601s">So</a> I would just ask, Mr. President, that we get back a citywide assessment of all our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=473.225s">And</a> also, if and when the street state complete streets grant program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=479.385s">that's</a> a mouthful comes in that we also look at addressing some of the concerns we have with our infrastructure, uh, throughout the community and also look at the, uh, $8 million in surplus of ratepayers money and the water and sewer enterprise account to start addressing these issues that at least I've been speaking about for at least 14 years now of addressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=502.115s">And,</a> uh, the city will go ahead here and there on small projects, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=506.267s">but</a> never really want to put a full, long-term, systematic approach to tackling some of these issues on behalf of the ratepayers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=721.137s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=722.598s">I've</a> offered this resolution at least four or five times. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=727.302s">over</a> the past number of years, uh, relative to pedestrian safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=731.325s">Uh,</a> for those that have been around for a while, know that, uh, that has always been, uh, one of my major concerns, uh, throughout the community is pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=741.652s">Uh,</a> it was back in 2006 that I offered the resolution asking for the city to look into the use of thermoplastic, uh, because, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=751.994s">It</a> seems year after year, it was like Groundhog Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=755.878s">Every</a> year, this time of year, we're faced with faded crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=760.482s">If</a> you go around the community, I'd say probably roughly 70 to 80% of our crosswalks are faded or barely visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=767.809s">And</a> these are supposed to be the areas where pedestrians know to cross because it's safe to cross in these particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=775.373s">And</a> year after year, bringing the subject up every year, saying, well, we painted them six months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=781.437s">Now</a> they're faded. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=782.418s">Well,</a> the winter gets to them, and the plows scratch them up, and they fade away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=787.661s">I</a> thought thermoplastic, which is used by a number of surrounding communities, Arlington, Cambridge, Boston, the state uses thermoplastic when they do their markings, was an effective and efficient way <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=802.733s">of</a> not only having our personnel go out every year and take the time to paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=807.202s">the</a> hundreds of crosswalks throughout the community, but also have a peace of mind knowing that once thermal plastic is laid down, that it lost up to five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=816.849s">So</a> it won't be Groundhog Day every year saying, you know what, we gotta get out there and paint them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=821.332s">Why</a> aren't they painted? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=822.473s">Who's</a> not doing their job? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=823.594s">Why</a> are things aren't getting done? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=825.155s">Why</a> is it unsafe to cross? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=827.317s">And</a> it didn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=829.218s">So</a> back in 2006, after my resolution, the mayor at the time, Mayor McGlynn, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=836.658s">put</a> forth 66 crosswalks throughout the community that were done with thermoplastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=842.543s">And</a> I remember at the time it was actually a proud moment that when these were done and for many years these crosswalks did stay in great shape and they were highly visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=854.902s">because</a> thermoplastic is very reflective and it alerts cars that someone's in the crosswalk, which ultimately is what is the intent of these crosswalks, to let people know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=869.453s">The</a> signage is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=870.533s">You'll</a> see the city now putting up neon signs, yellow and green, around the crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=875.607s">but</a> the crosswalks themselves are faded. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=878.669s">And</a> this particular thermoplastic over the years has improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=883.612s">It's</a> slip resistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=884.933s">It's</a> highly reflective. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=886.254s">Like</a> I said, it's life expectancy is up to five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=889.696s">It's</a> a little more expensive to lay down, but in the long run, it's cost effective because you're not having to go out there every year and take a certain number of city employees to paint them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=899.603s">And</a> that's if they all get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=902.585s">And</a> I asked through this resolution that <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=906.387s">the</a> city create a policy, and I believe there's a policy in Cambridge that you can go on their website, but any new road construction, any re-digging on Cambridge streets, they require it to be replaced, even if it was originally painted in an area, they require it to be replaced with thermoplastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=926.898s">So</a> I'm asking that the city administration create a policy in our community that any new roads, thermoplastic is placed down, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=935.046s">and</a> that from here on in, the painting of crosswalks throughout the community be done with thermoplastic and not regular paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=944.39s">And</a> I ask that we as a community do a better job when it comes to pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=953.953s">And</a> it's one thing to talk about pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=956.674s">It's</a> one thing to say that we're a safe community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=959.856s">But</a> in my opinion, you have to put your money where your mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=964.025s">And</a> in my opinion, thermoplastic is the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=969.289s">Thermoplastic</a> will provide safe crossing areas in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=973.911s">It</a> defines where you're supposed to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=976.873s">Right</a> now, you don't know if you're in a crosswalk or not because it's faded. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=981.076s">This</a> clearly defines and delineates where people are supposed to cross, and it makes it a safer crossing area, and especially at nighttime in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=991.443s">So</a> to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=993.248s">This</a> should be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=995.109s">It</a> should be part of the city policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=997.511s">I</a> look forward to a response from this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1000.393s">There</a> is money, again, through the state Complete Streets grant program that specifically earmarks money to pedestrian safety, and this would be an ideal situation so we don't have to talk about it year after year after year after year, every year since I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1019.126s">It's</a> 14 years now since I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1022.695s">Every</a> year, at a certain point, April, May, we start complaining that our crosswalks aren't painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1029.381s">Then</a> we hear back from the city saying they're gonna get to it, they're not sure if they can get to all of them, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1034.606s">And</a> that's alleviate that situation, and that's ensure our residents have a safe place to cross in our community, and I ask that we send this to the administration for response.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1609.208s">I</a> just want to say, I think, uh, one of the speakers brought up a great point and, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1613.652s">Why</a> hasn't this happened over the years? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1615.954s">It's</a> a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1618.395s">It's</a> not new. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1618.975s">It's</a> used all over the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1620.897s">The</a> state uses it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1622.498s">And</a> I'm sure they did their homework and research. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1625.479s">And</a> many local big surrounding communities use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1628.621s">And</a> I think one of the issues is that in this community, common sense doesn't always prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1635.205s">And</a> efficiency doesn't always prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1638.848s">And</a> I think that's what we've seen over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1641.72s">And</a> you could just take a look at Ring Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1644.422s">When</a> they did Ring Road behind the square, the city in the contract spent $56,000 on one crosswalk, one electronic sign crosswalk on Ring Road, $56,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1660.396s">And</a> I termed it as the crosswalk to nowhere because it leads into a parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1667.142s">It</a> was supposed to be set up for the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1669.056s">But</a> it leads into the parking lot across the street, which doesn't have any sidewalks or anywhere for seniors to walk other than behind parked cars, which is a very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1680.623s">So</a> I think that's what we saw over the years, the priority of putting one crosswalk for $56,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1687.226s">And</a> it's a beautiful crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1690.328s">It</a> has airport markings that light up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1694.272s">And</a> on the street, when someone's in the crosswalk, the sign lights up, you get a handshake when you go by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1701.855s">It's</a> a beautiful crosswalk, but for $56,000, we could have painted every crosswalk in the city with thermoplastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1710.238s">So</a> these are the type of decisions that were made in a vacuum, in the mayor's office, with no regards to the rest of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1719.861s">And</a> I think that's why the person that spoke <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1723.535s">at</a> the podium said, well, why doesn't these things happen in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1727.258s">Why</a> does it take so long? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1728.92s">And</a> I think that's what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1730.521s">These</a> are the reasons why the administration's talking about getting voicemail now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1735.726s">Guess</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1736.467s">City</a> employees are going to get voicemail on their phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1740.35s">That's</a> an item from 30 years ago, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1742.733s">They're</a> going to have voicemail now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1744.134s">And</a> they may even, thanks to Councilor Longo, they may even get email. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1748.706s">They</a> may even have their own email address now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1751.408s">This</a> is amazing what transformation we're going through in this city, and I think this is one of the reasons why we don't see these things enacted upon because of the lack of attention over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1763.038s">I</a> hope it changes, Mr. President, but thermoplastic makes sense in every stretch of the imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1770.273s">There's</a> no reason to research. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1772.995s">It's</a> been on the pavement for years throughout this entire state and throughout this entire country, very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1780.882s">And,</a> you know, just because the city of Bedford wants to keep their head in the sand doesn't mean this isn't a cost-effective and a safe manner for people to cross on our streets and our road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1793.873s">So</a> I appreciate the support from my colleagues and hope for <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1798.666s">a</a> thorough response from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1800.646s">We</a> look forward to all these innovations.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3277.823s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3278.923s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3281.345s">I</a> think this is a long sought after issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3285.908s">This</a> council, let's not forget, we're the legislative body in this community and zoning falls under our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3294.313s">So</a> it's this council that's been neglect over the years of reviewing the zoning ordinances within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3303.0s">But</a> I do have to say that we have department heads at City Hall for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3307.764s">And</a> we have the Office of Community Development, which is the first to hear from developers that come into the community saying, we'd like to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3315.97s">We're</a> interested in doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3318.418s">They</a> don't come to the council, these developers and these business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3322.679s">They</a> come to the city administration, the mayor, they come to the Office of Community Development, and they're the ones hearing these issues over the many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3331.102s">And</a> they're the ones that should be presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3332.842s">This</a> has always been an issue I've had with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3336.764s">They</a> should be presenting to the legislative body, like they do on the state level, the state department heads present to the legislature what they'd like to see done, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3347.703s">that</a> would perhaps help the Department of Energy or the Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3353.332s">That's</a> how it works at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3355.694s">And</a> the city, you'd never hear from a department head saying, you know what, if we created this ordinance, if we worked on amending this ordinance, it would help our community move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3365.422s">You'd</a> never hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3366.843s">And</a> the excuse of, well, there's no one really in the office of community development is no longer an excuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3372.889s">It's</a> no longer an excuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3374.93s">So</a> in my opinion, I agree with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3377.192s">I</a> think at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3378.653s">a</a> meeting between us, Community Development, Lauren D. Lorenzo-Paup, and the mayor, because the mayor has a key component in the direction this city's going in, sit down and discuss what are some of the concerns that they've been hearing about some of the needs in our zoning ordinances, and hear from our department head that we're paying $110,000 to do a job, and hear from that person, rather than, and I'm not criticizing Councilor Falco, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3406.917s">rather</a> than hiring a consultant at this point, I'd like to hear from our department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3411.102s">and</a> like them to come out with a list of recommendations that would go to the subcommittee on zoning, which Councilor Knight chairs, for review by this legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3420.227s">And</a> that's how we move items forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3422.928s">And</a> to me, you never hear a department head, even during budget time, come out and make recommendations or say, geez, we'd like to see this happen in the community, but our hands are tied because of city ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3435.334s">You</a> never hear that communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3437.275s">It's</a> really unfortunate, but you never hear that type of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3441.017s">And,</a> you know, I'd like to hear from the Office of Community Development, you know, to see what can be done to improve the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3449.141s">You're</a> right, we have many areas in this community that are commercial zone, that are residential districts, and we have another issue off of Walnut Street where someone wants to make an extra large opening for <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3461.95s">a</a> driveway, and it's taken at least three spots off the street, which is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3467.172s">We're</a> the only park on one side of the street already. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3469.813s">So</a> there's a lot of issues that we could address as a legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3475.114s">And</a> I don't think we have to go out and try to, you know, move mountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3479.395s">I</a> think we could tackle some of the issues that are presented from our department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3483.396s">That's</a> what they should be doing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3485.597s">Our</a> department heads should be coming to us saying, we'd like for you to enact <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3489.477s">You</a> know, the process in this city is reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3492.879s">We</a> get, it doesn't originate with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3494.84s">We</a> get correspondences from the mayor with ordinances that don't have any committee input, and they just come to us for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3504.445s">It</a> really is backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3505.986s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3507.227s">It</a> doesn't happen on the state level that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3509.068s">It</a> shouldn't happen on the city level that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3511.449s">So</a> I appreciate Councilor Falco offering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3514.941s">It's</a> definitely long sought. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3517.043s">Zoning</a> is the lifeblood of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3519.745s">It's</a> one of the most important, besides the budget, it's probably our second most important job, the zoning of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3526.509s">Without</a> zoning and proper zoning, the community will go to hell, really will. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3530.933s">And</a> it's probably the second most important job other than the setting of improving of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3537.177s">And</a> I think we've been neglect over the years, to be quite frank, in moving <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3542.013s">any</a> initiatives forward, or getting the appropriate people at the table, like Councilor Falco mentioned, you know, possibly a consultant or even the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3552.603s">So</a> that would be my recommendation, Mr. President, any meeting that the head of community development be present, as well as the mayor, to sit in a room and discuss issues of zoning.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_KSMq75MSz54/2025-03-21_KSMq75MSz54.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 15, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1081.472s">So</a> Louise, has the engineering firm been paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1084.053s">I</a> guess I'm not sure about that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1101.946s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1102.227s">So</a> is any portion of this 350,000 going to the engineering company?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1131.297s">But</a> it's going back to the city with the purpose of what?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1137.36s">And</a> not to pay the engineering firm?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1142.222s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1445.517s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1446.337s">Just</a> where this has been several months now, can you refresh my memory on the consultant firm that was hired by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1453.393s">what</a> their actual report back to the city was regarding the cost for the contaminants to be removed, and ultimately, what did it end up costing us?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1483.769s">Have</a> they been paid in full?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1487.191s">And</a> I know we had discussions with the city solicitor regarding trying to recoup some of our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1492.574s">Is</a> that futile right now or is that ongoing?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1540.805s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1541.425s">That,</a> that is one way of looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1544.046s">And</a> then another way is if there were other options on how to treat this, it could have been a plan a plan B plan C. And based on the dollar amount, we could have opted for a different plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1554.691s">So</a> I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1556.772s">And</a> you know, if it had to be removed, it was going to cost us that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1559.733s">But</a> I have a tough time paying a consultant company that comes in and this is their expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1565.627s">and</a> for them to go over $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1567.847s">We're</a> talking originally a million, and they said, oh, we're off by $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1573.688s">Why</a> pay this consultant company? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1575.389s">I</a> mean, why are we paying them?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1621.897s">And</a> we had a discussion some time back regarding what the protocol is with these particular companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1630.883s">And</a> I was under the impression that choosing anywhere from 5 to 10 percent, the margin of error, and to have the margin of error that's 50 percent, to me, would lend itself to some type of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1643.911s">And</a> I just see it on a number of fronts that <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1648.654s">Yeah,</a> I could have gave him that estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1650.436s">It's</a> a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1651.577s">I</a> mean, and I have no background in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1653.919s">Here's</a> a company that we bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1655.24s">What</a> do we pay this company? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1657.382s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1668.391s">We</a> were better off just doing it off the cuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1671.213s">could</a> have saved the $200,000 and just estimated ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1674.195s">I</a> mean, really, when you think about it, to be off $500,000, you know, I know we have to pay the bill, but it just really troubles me that, you know, they're allowed to get away with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1687.644s">And,</a> you know.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1743.96s">We've</a> used them in the past on a number of things.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1751.683s">And</a> you're saying the city stance right now is that we're not going to use them going forward?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1756.789s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1775.353s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1814.189s">Mr.</a> President, can you read the items so people at home and people here that maybe came for it know what's happening?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1886.442s">Mr.</a> President, I move the waiving of the remainder of the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1890.443s">That</a> was just to give anyone that's in the audience here or anyone at home to know that that issue has been withdrawn by the mayor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2063.197s">I'd</a> like to be recorded in opposition based on my stance regarding the need to update the current ordinance dealing with tax caps.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2923.233s">Council</a> Mars. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2924.734s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2925.695s">Um,</a> uh, a few years back, we were approached by the owners of, uh, Panera and smash burger and noodles, uh, regarding a common vigilance license. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2935.74s">And</a> at the time, uh, we put some stipulations on, uh, their particular permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2941.344s">And</a> one of them, uh, we put one on the drive through and a number of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2946.266s">Um,</a> but one of them was that they were going to improve the sidewalks across from <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2951.86s">their</a> business. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2952.94s">And</a> they agreed to do the sidewalk across from their establishment on the opposite side of Riverside Ave from, I believe, the length of the Christie's Market on down to the gas station and also the crosswalk to have that repainted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2972.688s">And</a> to date, we haven't seen any action on that sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2976.009s">It's</a> in very poor condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2977.63s">A</a> lot of people catch the bus up by the gas station <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2982.079s">And</a> now that that area is highly traveled, I would ask that they keep up with their commitment to the city and based on the Community Development Board and also the council vote that they be asked if and when, not if, when the work on the sidewalk will take place across from Panera, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3003.878s">So</a> I put in a request before. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3006.0s">I</a> don't think we got an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3007.682s">So</a> this is a second request.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3047.297s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3047.937s">Was</a> the city going to do that or were they going to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3049.857s">I</a> thought the city was going to undertake that, but we can also ask that as a secondary, because you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3056.299s">Cars</a> are now stopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3058.6s">The</a> people that are gracious enough are stopping and allowing traffic to come in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3062.861s">But</a> someone that lives in the area, I can tell you that's gridlock around the clock in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3069.293s">go</a> in and out of that entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3071.335s">So</a> I would ask that be added, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_WZBDDeqA2qI/2025-03-21_WZBDDeqA2qI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=130.901s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President, if someone happens to come to your home and they're doing door-to-door solicitation, my recommendation would be if they don't have a badge or a proper ID, <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=143.319s">that</a> the person find out where this person is from that's knocking on the door, contact the city clerk's office, and let the city clerk's office know where this person was from, and then the city clerk's office can reach out and let them know that we have a city audience that requires door-to-door solicitors to have proper identification, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=166.345s">So,</a> that would be my recommendation.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=957.979s">And,</a> um, I would like to speak on the fact that, <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=963.549s">The</a> waving of readings has not really been a common practice of this council over the years, and it's been used in the past for negotiations, for city employees, and with the hope of expediting whatever contractual agreements were made between the union and the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=983.266s">And</a> I would caution, especially when we have a few new members of the council that, and we've all spoke about transparency, <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=991.878s">is</a> that anytime you waive the remaining readings, you're canceling transparency, you're canceling public debate, you're canceling the opportunity for people to appear before the council that may have a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1007.624s">So</a> the first reading, as I'm not sure if my colleagues may or may not be aware, the first reading is when it first appears on the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1018.488s">That's</a> the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1019.709s">So</a> that's the first time it's up for debate and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1022.971s">The</a> second reading is when it's passed on to go for publication in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1031.495s">And</a> that is notification to the general public that may have not saw it on the council agenda the first time or wasn't aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1038.519s">So</a> it goes out in the paper and it's duly advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1041.54s">People</a> read it and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1043.381s">I'm</a> interested in this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1045.262s">I'm</a> going to go up to the council meeting when this appears for the third reading, <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1048.663s">And</a> I'd like to speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1050.744s">However,</a> if we waive the reading, we're doing away with all the processes that are set up for a good government, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1059.647s">And</a> I would ask, Mr. President, respectfully ask, because I don't think my colleague's intent is to do away with the public process or do away with public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1068.79s">But,</a> you know, the three-reading process is state statute, and it's there for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1075.583s">And</a> I know in the past it's been used, and not often, but it's been used to expedite the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1081.128s">But</a> in my opinion, any time there's a change in city ordinance, we don't want to expedite the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1087.213s">We</a> want to make sure everyone has the equal opportunity and ample opportunity to be heard before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1094.298s">So</a> I would respectfully ask my council colleague to withdraw the request to waive the readings, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2362.755s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2363.856s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Longo's comments that the city administration has to take a more active role on this particular project <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2370.978s">Although</a> Medford only has a small footprint in the overall project itself, there should be ample public notification for residents, particular abutters that are impacted by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2384.884s">We</a> all know the traffic was going to be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2386.925s">This</a> council has gone on record for the past, I believe it's four or five years now, asking that the cut-through road in the back that leads up to Murray Hill Road be closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2397.089s">And</a> we had the chief of police here, I believe it was about a year, year and a half ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2400.781s">And</a> he said he will never let that particular road be opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2405.343s">That</a> would be a shortcut to 93 and be a terrible impact on the neighborhood, Grover and Murray Hill Road and Fry and that whole particular area up there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2416.688s">So</a> I'm happy to see that we did take a step on assuring residents that that cut-through road will not be reopened again like it was years ago, and that the buffer between the project and the homes be maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2430.844s">because</a> part of the project called for some of the shrubbery and wooded area, which acts as a buffer between the project and the neighborhood, be removed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2443.252s">And</a> that's a large issue of contention with neighbors and the project itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2450.117s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2453.959s">I</a> think an ad hoc committee, any time we put together <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2457.248s">at</a> least some oversight on behalf of this community is a good idea, so I would support this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2693.957s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2694.837s">I</a> think this is a worthy suggestion, although I would ask my council colleague, maybe if we could send it to the licensing subcommittee and have it originate from the licensing subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2704.527s">I</a> think it would hold a little more weight coming through that angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2707.89s">First,</a> I would also ask that, uh, although the request now says the traffic commission, council Kaviello just said he likes it with the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2717.738s">Those</a> are two separate entities, traffic commission and the police department, the two separate entities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2723.322s">So</a> if you like what the police department, you don't like this because this is sending it to the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2728.506s">And</a> right now I'm not aware of any licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2731.309s">The</a> traffic commission is responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2733.531s">They</a> are responsible for signage, street markings and other important issues in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2738.854s">Uh,</a> but, um, this would be a difference in what they are currently responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2744.858s">I'm</a> not saying I'm opposed to it, but I think maybe if it's before the subcommittee on licensing, uh, we can come up with a better option. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2753.402s">And</a> I would probably tend to agree that the police department would be probably the best option where we already have someone that's in what we refer to the hackney division. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2762.417s">that's</a> responsible to make sure these cars are properly registered, make sure these cars adhere to city ordinances and codes and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2771.762s">So</a> I would just respectfully ask my colleague if we could send it to the licensing subcommittee, maybe hash out some of these questions and then move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2780.087s">I</a> think it's a very worthy suggestion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3015.707s">Mr.</a> President, can I just ask a question?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3021.438s">Have</a> you been denied access with your service dog with Medford cabs?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3052.696s">And</a> just one other question too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3056.937s">You</a> mentioned that Cambridge requires testing of their cab drivers?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3118.466s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3119.266s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3120.267s">Mr.</a> President, if we just could, maybe where the licenses are issued by, they're approved by the council, but issued by the city clerk, that we can send out a letter or contact these drivers to let them know that they are required to take <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3136.468s">residents</a> that have a service dog, and I assume that's state statute, Mr. Clerk, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3142.331s">Federal</a> statute? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3143.732s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3143.872s">Or</a> it's the ADA? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3145.834s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3146.094s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3147.154s">Can</a> we send a letter, Mr. Clerk, to let these drivers know? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3152.337s">It</a> will be made as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3154.178s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3154.719s">I</a> love the idea of testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3156.4s">I</a> think that's a great concept that Cambridge uses.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3174.751s">That's</a> the written exam, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3177.252s">Very</a> interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3180.073s">Well,</a> this is why Councilor Knight wants to look into the issue.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3239.385s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3239.665s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3241.646s">What</a> council Caraviello just mentioned was one of the reasons why we asked the licensing subcommittee to reconvene. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3248.355s">and</a> come out with an ordinance that addresses some of the concerns that we're, you know, hearing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3254.658s">And</a> one of them was that we bantered around was that if you had a cab company in the city that had more than, I believe it was three or four cabs, that they were required under city ordinance to provide at least one handicap cab. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3267.763s">And</a> those were the things that we wanted to build into the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3271.404s">But</a> the licensing subcommittee, for some reason, never met on this, Mr. President, and never addressed some of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3278.425s">But</a> maybe now we can eventually move this on and maybe give it to someone more equipped to looking into these issues and presenting these issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3289.628s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3289.948s">So</a> on the motion approved by Councilor Knight as amended.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3715.737s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3716.738s">And</a> I think this is one of the reasons why the school department felt they need a public relations person to not get back to a resident, a business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3726.742s">This</a> gentleman's owned a business in the city for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3730.124s">He</a> was here in the square for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3732.312s">Now</a> he's on Salem Street, he runs a reputable business, and that sends a lousy message in this community when people don't return phone calls or e-mails, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3742.28s">And</a> if they're not the right person he should be talking to, then it's a two-second call saying, you know what, you have to talk to this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3748.444s">Or</a> as Councilor Scarpelli said, circle the wagons and re-talk to the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3752.808s">But</a> to not to get back to someone sends an awful message, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3756.631s">And</a> just let me speak as a parent tonight, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3760.485s">And</a> if the PR person wants to work on something with the superintendent, it's a nightmare, Mr. President, trying to get out of the Medford High School parking lot on a Friday afternoon, on an early release day on a Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3773.048s">It</a> takes you a half hour to 45 minutes to get out of the Medford High School parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3778.49s">It's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3780.23s">And</a> in the case of an emergency, Mr. President, God forbid someone had to get out of there in an emergency, I don't know what would happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3788.473s">It's</a> unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3789.642s">It's</a> not the first time, it happens every Friday up there, every early release day, and it's unacceptable that it has to continue that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3797.426s">Last</a> Wednesday, I witnessed kids coming down the hill on the ice, we got a little rain and some ice there, and there wasn't any salt or anything put, and you had to see the kids try to traverse down the hill, which many kids do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3812.835s">It's</a> unacceptable that the property's not kept after. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3817.969s">We</a> all remember years ago what happened in the city of Boston when they didn't shovel sidewalks and kids walked in the street and were struck by a vehicle, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3827.516s">And</a> it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3828.857s">I</a> don't know what's going on with that high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3830.899s">But</a> let me tell you, they're putting positions up there, they're hiring administrators, and we can't get them to salt and sand for the kids, and we can't get them to move the parking lot cars <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3841.553s">out</a> of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3842.893s">You</a> can't get them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3844.234s">I</a> would ask anyone of the council here to go up there at 2.15 on a Friday, park in the lot, and see how long it takes you to get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3853.817s">See</a> how long it takes you to get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3856.077s">That's</a> a major concern, and it shouldn't be happening this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3859.879s">We</a> have a police officer that's assigned up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3862.459s">We</a> have an officer that's <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3864.837s">a</a> high school safety officer that's assigned up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3867.899s">And</a> he does his best. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3869.32s">Mr.</a> Mosaic has been up there a lot of years, and he does his best. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3872.602s">But</a> he's one person, and there's hundreds of cars trying to pick up students, buses, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3878.806s">And</a> it really is — it's a shame that, as a city our size, that we can't get a handle on how to alleviate the trafficking issues that are going on at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3890.513s">I</a> really — I really have to say that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3892.634s">And</a> I hope this gets to <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3893.957s">the</a> superintendent of schools and the school committee, because it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3898.738s">And</a> they should be well aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3900.379s">This</a> is nothing new. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3901.579s">This</a> has been happening for years up there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3904.62s">And</a> the students walking down a slippery sidewalk is a concern of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3910.362s">It</a> should be a concern of everyone behind this railing, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3940.471s">As</a> amended by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=3943.393s">All</a> those in favor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4174.743s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4176.143s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4178.663s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Longo for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4182.904s">Regarding</a> customer service, we're all aware that the City of Method will implement the 311 <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4189.513s">C-Click</a> and Fix program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4191.933s">I</a> believe it's going to be March or April, and that's long awaited. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4195.554s">And</a> I thank the administration for moving forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4198.615s">However,</a> Mr. President, I read online inside Method that the C-Click and Fix has been used for the past several years so Method residents can go on and put on a request that they may have for city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4217.858s">So</a> I went online. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4219.642s">I</a> put C-Click Fix Method, and indeed it brought up 240 postings since 2009 of Method residents going on the C-Click and Fix saying, I have a pothole in front of my house, or I'm concerned the stop sign fell down in front of my house, how do I get it repaired? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4238.935s">And</a> needless to say, these requests that residents believe are going to someone here at City Hall are going nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4248.387s">And</a> I looked through to see if there were response or if any of these issues were closed and I couldn't find one response. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4255.952s">I</a> couldn't find anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4257.373s">So</a> I sent an email back to the editor of inside method saying, um, you know, where did this all come about that people are reaching out to see click and fix when it's not implemented in the city yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4267.839s">And</a> they've been doing it since 2009 and she had no idea why people would have gone on that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4274.683s">But</a> this gets back to, <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4276.5s">the</a> issue we've been talking about, customer service, and the fact that the city never had anything set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4282.223s">So</a> people in the community are reaching out to, in any format they can, they're reaching out to an application that the city doesn't even subscribe to, to try to get answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4294.028s">The</a> department heads on on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4296.429s">So</a> I'm hoping with this new administration, and I think we're seeing some movement now, which makes me quite happy in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4305.355s">And,</a> you know, I'm looking forward to this implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4310.318s">Last</a> week I mentioned that you can implement all the systems you want, but unless we have the boots on the street, unless we have the capability of responding back and actually fixing some of the concerns, this program will not be a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4327.908s">So</a> I think it has to be followed with additional personnel in DPW, additional personnel in <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4334.688s">some</a> of the other departments, like we're seeing police, fire, across the board on the municipal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4339.95s">Otherwise,</a> you know, we're going to have a great system set up to capture requests from residents, but not be able to resolve any of the issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4349.234s">So,</a> I think that has to be the second part. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4351.515s">I'm</a> not sure if the administration has that as a second option.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4369.876s">That</a> could be a request, and Councilor Lungo and I offered a couple weeks ago that we receive a full training of the program itself, and we have yet to get a response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4380.465s">Mr.</a> Clerk, have we got a response back regarding training for members of this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4386.204s">That</a> just went out last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4389.885s">But</a> we even asked before that, we asked before that, that we be part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4396.568s">In</a> December or? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4398.449s">I</a> believe in December, but department heads have been trained on this system already. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4402.17s">There's</a> no reason why we as city officials who failed a lot of these calls should also be trained on this and be able to point people in the right direction when they reach out to us, phone call, email, and be able to explain this new <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4416.407s">particular</a> program that's going to be implemented, the 3-1-1 system, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4938.267s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4939.687s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4940.027s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4941.748s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4942.708s">Last</a> week, the council brought up the issue with the Craddock Bridge and the business owners in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4949.547s">and</a> the lack of addressing some of the concerns by DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4953.329s">Have</a> we heard any response back regarding the barriers and access to some of the properties?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5029.762s">If</a> we didn't receive a response, that's what we discussed last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5033.984s">So</a> it'll be up to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5037.566s">Chair</a> recommends Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5163.989s">I</a> don't know if the city solicitor is prepared to discuss this, but maybe if we can ask his legal opinion, what our next step is as the legislative body in this community, because I hear what Councilor Knight's saying about sitting down and coming up with comprehensive plans and so forth, but this has been an ongoing issue for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5184.94s">And</a> I don't think we can, in good faith, tell the business owners any longer that we're going to, you know, hold this up any further. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5192.223s">A</a> day lost is a dollar lost for these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5196.624s">And</a> I, as one member, think we're at the point right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5199.806s">I</a> want to work with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5201.006s">But</a> I think we're at the point right now where we have to send a stronger message, and that message may be a halt at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5207.048s">And</a> you better believe they'll sit down at the table immediately and address some of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5211.15s">But</a> I'd like to pose that question to you, Mr. Solicitor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5337.973s">So</a> should we be bringing in the building commissioner and office of community development to work on <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5344.928s">or</a> in concert with this council?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_c_1hhrksa9M/2025-03-21_c_1hhrksa9M.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 12, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3845.478s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3846.999s">It</a> was brought up by Councilor Caraviello during a Committee of the Whole meeting that the position of procurement officer requires a special license. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3856.122s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3858.313s">Now,</a> this new job title is Procurement Plus Budget Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3863.895s">And</a> as Councilor Caraviello mentioned so eloquently inside the Committee of the Whole meeting, is that Louise Miller now has her license. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3871.337s">But</a> what's to say the next person that's hired is going to have that procurement license or is brought in for budgeting and doesn't have a procurement license? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3881.96s">I</a> just think the administration is tying their hands with putting both positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3887.112s">together.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3976.979s">I</a> take it respectfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3980.382s">My</a> only issue is that when Louise Miller was originally hired, she was hired as <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3984.964s">the</a> procurement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3987.166s">And</a> then her description morphed into a number of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3992.069s">And</a> I'm not, to be quite frank with you, I'm not opposed to any of the changes that is offered by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3998.093s">I</a> think it's a long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4000.275s">I</a> was hoping to see a constituent person, which was mentioned on many, many occasions, something that I feel is needed, in addition to a chief of staff, someone that will handle the constituent calls and be able to get back to people in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4014.397s">And</a> I've yet to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4015.458s">But</a> my only concern is that many of these positions have morphed into other positions over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4022.243s">And</a> as we know, we used to have a director of personnel and a budget director that no longer exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4027.987s">Then</a> we had someone that was a procurement officer that was doing the duties, because as far as I know, Louise was still signing off on the paperwork and also was budget director and I believe at some point was personnel director. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4042.497s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4043.137s">For</a> a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4044.465s">That</a> position morphed into three what I would consider department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4048.449s">So</a> I only bring up that issue because I would hate to create a city ordinance and then in six months from now, a year, two years, whatever it might be, be unable to find a person that suits the procurement requirements, which is certification, and also the budgeting requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4068.163s">And</a> that may be a special person that is unique to Louise and not unique to a lot of people out there in that profession.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4137.783s">I</a> don't think anyone's saying that this is the end and the final. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4141.204s">But,</a> you know, for many years, we've received piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4144.965s">And</a> one of the biggest issues with this council, besides transparency, was the fact that we receive things in piecemeal form. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4153.267s">And</a> as we receive tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4155.692s">These</a> are great first steps, but I as one, like Councilor Longo mentioned, would like to see the overall picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4161.017s">What</a> is the current organizational chart of the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4165.54s">What's</a> it going to look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4166.781s">What's</a> the additional staff that's going to be needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4169.263s">There's</a> talk about a 3-1-1 system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4172.226s">The</a> 3-1-1 system is only as good, and we heard from Councilor Scarpelli, who happens to work in Somerville, and they've had this system for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4181.392s">It's</a> only as good as the staff that you have on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4184.517s">And</a> we all know many of our departments, DPW, you can go through the list, are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4189.986s">So</a> it's great to say we're going to implement this new program, which I've been pushing for for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4195.294s">But</a> I've yet to see any substance behind it that's going to say, with this new program, we're going to be able to staff it appropriately so people get timely calls back and their issues are addressed in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4208.023s">So</a> these are the things, I guess, I'm not part of that 28-person transition committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4214.007s">But</a> these are the things that I have questions on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4217.309s">And</a> the reason why we asked that it be tabled is <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4220.475s">that</a> we see an overall picture.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4733.485s">There's</a> no yielding chair recognizes Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4739.067s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4740.988s">Maybe</a> Mr. Solicitor, if you could answer something that does the treasure collector report to the city auditor in the normal course? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4751.392s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4752.353s">So,</a> so I can see what you're saying, but how does the oversight exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4757.721s">when</a> it's one and the same person?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4814.812s">So,</a> so getting back to the question regarding the auditor's responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4818.015s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4818.735s">Then</a> where is the oversight now with the treasurer collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4822.958s">Is</a> it within an Baker in the auditor's position? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4825.841s">Yes,</a> it would have to be.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4835.869s">Yes,</a> that is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4837.61s">So</a> she has a concern in the treasurer collector's office.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4842.44s">She</a> reports back as the acting treasurer-collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4845.782s">As</a> incongruous as that may sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4849.104s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4849.385s">And</a> why is it assistant treasurer-collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4853.747s">There</a> is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4854.728s">Why</a> would that person not assume the responsibilities?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6207.254s">I</a> just want to, uh, reiterate what council Longo just said that, uh, we need to have a presentation on how this is going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6214.799s">This</a> is a very important system, uh, in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6218.741s">And,</a> um, at the very least, I think we should have a committee, the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6222.383s">So,</a> uh, the sooner we can set that up, the better.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6486.981s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6488.561s">It's</a> a breath of fresh air to have someone with a council of Falco's background in budgeting, uh, in his, uh, profession, uh, on the council, because that's been a bone of contention, uh, with this council for many years, uh, receiving a line item budget from the administration and really nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6508.745s">No</a> narrative, no clear direction on which way the city's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6513.008s">And</a> with that being said, I happen to have done a little research on outcomes-based budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6520.954s">And</a> you're probably familiar with it, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6524.396s">But</a> if I could, Mr. President, I just want to read a little narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6528.6s">Because</a> I think this is the exact direction, at least I as one member of the council, and from what I'm hearing from other members of the council, would like to see take place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6538.34s">It</a> states the new fiscal reality facing cities and towns across the Commonwealth necessitates that communities must be more judicious and prudent than ever before in their approach to providing services. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6550.349s">Outcome-based</a> budgeting, as opposed to the more traditional line-item incremental budgeting where expenditures are increased or decreased by a percentage from prior year levels, outcome-based budgeting is unique in that it ties in strategic planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6568.158s">Performance</a> management. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6570.68s">Outcome-based</a> budgeting requires the mayor and department heads to develop an improved set of government priorities for the coming year, such as enhanced public safety or increased economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6582.691s">These</a> larger priorities then cascade down through the departments and permeate each of their own annual work plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6588.836s">Resources</a> are then calibrated toward the specific activities that are designed to realize those outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6595.31s">I</a> mean, I think that's exactly what we as a council have been talking about for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6600.603s">You</a> know, it's great to get a line item budget, and there's 10,000 line items on that, and we go through and we say, okay, last year you gave line item 003 10,000, this year it's getting 11,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6612.886s">There's</a> no rhyme to reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6614.086s">Why</a> is it getting 11,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6615.666s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6616.907s">You</a> know, one line item goes down, one goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6620.848s">And</a> it never really addresses priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6624.088s">We've</a> been talking about public safety, the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6626.709s">We've</a> been talking about the need for additional cruises. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6628.97s">We've</a> been talking about the need to repair roads and sidewalks and so forth, the leaking ceilings and preventive maintenance in our community on some of our city-owned buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6639.853s">And</a> really, every year, we never really address those particular issues in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6645.275s">It's</a> more or less just looking at last year's budget and adding or decreasing lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6652.057s">There's</a> really no rhyme to reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6654.365s">And</a> this outcomes-based budgeting, I think, it may not be the solve-all, but it allows us to hear from the different departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6661.226s">It</a> allows us, as Councilor Peto would state year after year, that if you had a wish list, you used to ask every department head, what is your wish list? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6670.929s">And,</a> you know, the department heads would either be open with you or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6674.129s">But</a> this outcomes-based budgeting forces their hand to say, hey, the administration wants to act upon public safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6682.841s">And</a> those particular department heads that have public safety within their budget would have to raise particular areas in their budget to address the needs of the community and what direction the mayor wants to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6696.566s">So,</a> I support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6699.927s">I</a> thank Councilor Falco for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6703.008s">And,</a> you know, the ultimate goal is to ensure that each dollar in the city has a well-designed purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6711.008s">each</a> dollar is accountable to whatever resources they're earmarked to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6716.631s">And</a> as we all know, at the end of a budget year, at any given year, we're transferring millions of dollars that we thought were appropriated for this particular use. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6725.275s">A</a> million dollars is going towards this, and at the end of the year, we have a million dollar surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6732.258s">And</a> I think that speaks volumes on the need to dig a little deeper, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6739.656s">So,</a> that's what Councilor Falco is saying, and I hope this is part of the new process and the budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6746.319s">I</a> thank you for offering this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6973.329s">Just</a> a quick point, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6974.989s">This</a> council has requested, I believe, unanimously over the last several budgets that also within our budget book, we receive a column that shows whether the account was in a deficit or had a surplus the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6988.535s">And</a> I, as one member, know that's very helpful to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6992.196s">And,</a> for instance, snow and ice, we end up funded by hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6996.848s">It's</a> the only account that you can budget deficit spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7001.649s">And</a> but it's helpful, I think, especially as new members of the council, those two new members to see what accounts every year go into deficit, whether it's overtime or whatever have you, and then make adjustments accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7016.413s">And,</a> you know, I think any good budget person will make those adjustments on the fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7021.574s">So</a> year after year, you don't have the same accounts that are in deficit or surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7026.848s">where</a> money is being transferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7028.149s">So</a> I would again ask that be part of this report that the previous year that we receive whether or not that account was in a surplus or deficit.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8607.099s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8608.88s">Many</a> of us know Johnny Amari for many years in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8614.306s">Johnny</a> has been an active member of this community for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8618.909s">He's</a> a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8619.89s">He</a> just celebrated his 50th birthday, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8623.913s">I</a> had the opportunity to attend his birthday party. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8627.315s">And</a> let me tell you, Johnny hasn't changed a bit over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8632.819s">He's</a> the same guy I remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8634.1s">I</a> grew up on Stearns Ave, right next door to Johnny. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8638.123s">And</a> he's the same gentleman I remember from years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8641.954s">And</a> many of us refer to him as the mayor of South Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8646.496s">And</a> he truly is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8648.116s">He's</a> a staple in that particular section of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8651.658s">And</a> I just want to wish him a happy 50th and another 50 for Johnny.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8672.09s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8673.531s">MassDOT</a> came out with their construction detour information just recently, and I received a number of calls from area residents that were concerned about the increased traffic coming down some of the side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8692.121s">And</a> I know the south side of Harvard Street <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8697.668s">is</a> to be completed and reopened on January 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8702.992s">After</a> the sidewalk is reopened, the gravel sidewalk on the north side will be closed for grading, curb, installation, and paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8710.138s">The</a> north side walk is estimated to be completed by February 5th, assuming no weather-related delays. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8718.365s">And</a> work cannot occur on the north side until the south side work is completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8724.36s">Each</a> side requires its own lane closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8727.382s">During</a> the construction of the Harvard Street sidewalks, Winchester Street, and this is why I bring this up, Mr. President, is being used to detour traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8735.627s">The</a> result of this is that there is an increase of speeding vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8739.389s">Residents</a> trying to exit their driveways onto Winchester from Morton, Granville, and Wareham are experiencing near misses trying to get out of their driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8749.635s">The</a> recommendation from the neighbors I spoke with <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8752.881s">They'd</a> like to see, at least for the next several weeks, the temporary electronic flashing speed sign, speed limit sign, appear on Winchester Street to try to slow down some of these people that are using this particular area now, and that an increase in police patrols during rush hours be implemented to help alleviate some of the concerns of the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8778.679s">So</a> I would ask that those two recommendations, the temporary electronic flashing <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8782.617s">speed</a> sign be placed on Winchester Street, and increased patrols during rush hour, during the rush hours on Winchester and those surrounding Morton and Granville and Wareham.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8894.064s">I</a> thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing up this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8897.145s">However,</a> I would state, Mr. President, when DOT was before us, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8901.492s">with</a> all their high-paid salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8903.873s">They</a> mentioned there's going to be a 24-hour hotline. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8906.513s">There's</a> going to be contact people we can get a hold of. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8909.014s">Now</a> we're hearing we have to petition our own traffic commission because we're unable to get a hold of DOT, as Councilor Caraviello just mentioned, to make some small — these are minor changes, which makes — Mr. President, we met with them at 10 o'clock that evening, and they agreed to make these changes, and they just ignored it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8927.159s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8927.579s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8928.019s">So</a> — so, that's my issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8930.32s">You</a> know, if — <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8931.519s">elected</a> officials, as Councilor Caraviello, are unable to address some of the minor concerns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8939.284s">Maybe</a> we have to put a halt on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8941.786s">Maybe</a> it's about time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8942.747s">And</a> I mentioned this several months ago, and, you know, I got a lot of feedback from people that were supportive of it, that we put a temporary halt on the project until some of these questions that are being asked by area businesses, Mr. President, and issues that Councilor Caraviello just mentioned about the Jersey Barriers <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8961.472s">are</a> addressed, because it seems to me that DOT is not a willing partner in this, and they're going to go down kicking on every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8969.915s">And</a> so, you know, if the council sees fit, I think we should offer a resolution, Mr. President, asking that if these issues are not addressed immediately, then a halt to the project be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8982.059s">And</a> we take a vote on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8983.099s">The</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8999.973s">Mr.</a> Clerk, if you would please call the roll timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9003.836s">So</a> we know when we can, uh, should we wait a week to get a response? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9008.979s">Well,</a> we'll go into the traffic commission, which means monthly on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9013.002s">Um,</a> they don't meet again until next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9015.863s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9017.044s">Which</a> is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9019.34s">It</a> seems like a long time to wait.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9143.998s">I</a> would say if we don't hear, if this is not resolved by next Tuesday, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9147.714s">And</a> next Tuesday we take a vote to stop the project to stop the project.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9187.267s">Mr.</a> President, over the last, I think it's been three months now, I put on two separate resolutions that were voted unanimously by this council asking about the temporary speed bumps that were placed on Harvard Street and Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9204.571s">I'm</a> under the impression that the one on Harvard Street now is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9208.673s">as</a> recently as a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9210.914s">That</a> has been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9212.175s">I</a> have yet to get a response on two separate resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9215.937s">Those</a> two locations were part of the pilot program that involved three raised, not speed bumps, three raised crosswalks, of which Winthrop Street was the only one that was placed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9228.423s">And</a> I've yet to get a response, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9230.624s">I</a> know there's a new administration now, but I'm hoping that we can get a response back from someone in engineering or someone in DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9238.046s">or</a> someone in the building that's in the know why these two speed bumps have popped up in the community, why one now is gone, and what's happening with the raised crosswalks that the mayor came out with a press conference saying that this was part of the initial pilot program to help with pedestrian safety in our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9258.803s">Right,</a> three years ago, and to help mitigate some of the concerns we have with increased speeding in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9266.42s">So</a> I really would like to get an answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9268.321s">This</a> is a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9270.621s">This</a> is, this is not just some pie in the sky issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9273.182s">This</a> is a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9274.883s">We</a> read all the time in the paper about pedestrians being struck and killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9279.345s">And</a> it's not in every other community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9280.665s">It's</a> in our community too. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9282.186s">And,</a> and really, uh, to not address these concerns is a detrimental Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_1nhdBin4gl8/2025-03-21_1nhdBin4gl8.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 15, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1035.504s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1036.624s">And</a> I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1039.567s">There's</a> been no bigger advocate for public access in this community than Councilor Penta over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1045.612s">But</a> he hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1048.033s">Where</a> else, Mr. President, can you pay for a service and not receive it, and then no one says anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1055.339s">It'd</a> be like going to the gas station and saying, give me $10 worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1058.302s">They</a> give you $9, and then you say, thank you very much, and you leave.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1062.765s">It</a> doesn't happen that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1064.702s">That's</a> not the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1066.162s">And</a> for several years now, residents of this community have been paying, take a look at your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1071.663s">You're</a> paying a franchise fee for local access peg, which is public access, the government and educational channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1079.845s">And</a> for several years now, public access, in my opinion, which is probably the more important of the three, which allows people to come in and do local programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1089.903s">You</a> know, it's great to watch 4, 5, 7 and all the History Channel and all those channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1094.626s">They</a> got great programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1096.187s">But</a> what better to have local access where you can watch a local show and talk about local issues and see local people on TV discussing politics, discussing athletics, discussing education, discussing a myriad of issues in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1112.659s">And</a> we've been cheated out of that for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1115.961s">And</a> it's unfortunate, as my council colleague mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1119.624s">It's</a> almost half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1122.35s">This</a> is not chump change that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1125.918s">It's</a> a half a million dollars of ratepayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1130.245s">And,</a> you know, for the most part, you know, people may be looking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1133.426s">But</a> now public access has been out of the public realm for so many years now, I don't even think people know that they're not getting it anymore, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1142.65s">And</a> it's a real shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1144.351s">It</a> really is a real shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1146.112s">And</a> I agree with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1148.373s">I</a> hope, you know, under the city charter, the only one that signs contracts in the community is the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1154.835s">It's</a> the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1156.316s">And</a> the mayor has put together a contract <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1159.457s">with</a> Verizon and Comcast, which includes public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1164.859s">And</a> the mayor says, Verizon and Comcast, it's all right for you to charge every person under my city an additional fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1173.423s">But</a> the mayor has been the one to neglect not to provide the service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1178.445s">So</a> the mayor is saying, Comcast, Verizon, go in and tax these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1182.286s">Take</a> money out of their pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1184.524s">but</a> I'm not going to provide the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1186.504s">That's</a> what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1187.725s">Because</a> if you call Comcast and Verizon, they'll tell you they have nothing to do with local programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1193.186s">That's</a> up to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1195.246s">So</a> it's been the mayor, Mr. President, that's been reaching his hand in the pockets of each and every ratepayer in this community and not providing the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1205.449s">Where</a> else can you do that, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1208.069s">There</a> should be a class action suit in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1212.759s">Where</a> else can you charge people for a service you're not getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1215.7s">It</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1217.761s">It</a> really doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1219.002s">And</a> I can appreciate the fact that there were some tough times back a few years ago, but it doesn't take two, three, four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1228.135s">to</a> put together a cable operation, public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1231.656s">It</a> doesn't take that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1233.397s">We</a> have plenty of capable people in the community that are willing to step up and run this particular channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1240.439s">We</a> have students from Medford High School and the elementary and middle schools that want to partake in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1247.621s">We're</a> missing precious sports events that we could be taping, like the Thanksgiving game, although this game we probably didn't want to tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1255.113s">this</a> past game. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1255.854s">But,</a> you know, we're missing a lot of things, Mr. President, that are going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1262.458s">And</a> it's a real shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1263.778s">It</a> really is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1265.66s">And</a> I hope, you know, before the mayor leaves, I hope that he acts on — there's a number of issues on the table that the mayor is yet to act on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1273.785s">And</a> I'm hoping the next week or two he acts on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1276.646s">But</a> this is one that's too important to let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1279.708s">This</a> is one that, you know, everyone's paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1282.59s">And</a> if the mayor is against, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1285.184s">public</a> access, just come out and say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1288.005s">And</a> then say, okay, we're going to stop charging for public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1291.427s">That</a> would be the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1293.448s">Maybe</a> the mayor's opposed to public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1295.549s">Maybe</a> the mayor doesn't want the laundry issued out on local access and wants to keep everything in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1303.112s">And</a> he's doing a great job of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1304.773s">But</a> the case is, he's also charging us for that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1308.814s">So</a> I thank my council colleague, Councilor Penta, on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1312.396s">And</a> I hope maybe under the next administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1315.153s">there's</a> more transparency, and that that administration realizes the need for public access, and especially in a community of this size, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1324.779s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3532.331s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3533.532s">If</a> my memory serves me correct, it was about probably <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3537.979s">A</a> year and a half, two years ago, the mayor created a raised crosswalk pilot program in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3544.443s">Three</a> years ago, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3546.284s">And</a> at that time, they came out with three locations, Winthrop Street, Central Ave, and Harvard Street for raised crosswalks for the first phase of implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3556.971s">Winthrop</a> Street, as we all know, has been done and quite successful from what I hear from area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3563.708s">However,</a> over the last, I think it was six, seven months ago, Central Ave, a speed bump popped up in the middle of Central Ave, and now just recently Harvard Street now has the same speed bump, which is very different than a raised crosswalk, and many surrounding communities that have used speed bumps are now removing it, like the city of Malden had several speed bumps, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3589.793s">and</a> have removed them for various public safety issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3594.754s">I</a> asked, I believe it was two weeks ago, that we get a response back from the city administration regarding why speed bumps are popping up on our streets rather than the raised crosswalk, and we did not get a response, Mr. President, to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3610.558s">So</a> again, I am asking that <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3613.223s">We</a> reach out to the administration to find out why they are installing speed bumps rather than the anticipated and proposed raised crosswalks, which are far better in traffic calming than a speed bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3632.031s">So</a> I would again ask that question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3635.913s">I</a> know there's been some e-mails going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3639.694s">I</a> know the bike, method bike <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3642.245s">is</a> concerned about these speed bumps also. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3645.208s">And</a> there have been a number of issues raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3647.93s">And</a> residents that were waiting for these raised crosswalks now are questioning why speed bumps are showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3656.018s">And</a> we have yet to get any response from the administration.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4418.223s">Motion</a> to table, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M/2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M.html">Medford City Council - October 20, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2218.718s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2220.319s">And</a> I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2223.681s">You</a> know, this is not a new issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2226.202s">This</a> issue of the lack of funding that the city has taken a backseat for many, many years on providing seed money, if you want to call it seed money. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2238.448s">And</a> we have to remember, this is a city building. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2242.109s">This</a> is not a private building. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2243.99s">This</a> is a city-owned building that <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2246.722s">has</a> been neglected for many years, and thanks to the Friends of Chevalier and the Chevalier Commission that have done Yeoman's work over many, many years, and with all open transparency, I am a member of the board of the Friends of Chevalier, and I can speak firsthand about the countless hours that no one sees behind the scenes of how these performances get put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2273.003s">And</a> it's not because the city's pushing, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2275.083s">or</a> if the city's providing seed money, it's the volunteers that are putting this all together and spending countless hours, as May just mentioned and Susan just mentioned, about the performances. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2288.513s">This</a> weekend will be the BJs, BJs, the BGs, and I can just tell you wholeheartedly that that type of performance should bring out a group of 800, 900 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2301.843s">And</a> I would hope that we anticipate that because <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2305.642s">I</a> think that suits well to the age group, not only in this community, but surrounding communities that grew up with that type of music. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2313.106s">But</a> I just want to mention, Mr. President, that until this city gets serious about its public facilities, and, you know, it was only just recently within the last couple of years that the city finally acknowledged that the arts were part of the community and put a line item in the budget to support those, a minimal line item, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2335.163s">but</a> it showed in good faith that the city's behind the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2339.065s">And</a> there's no reason why, and the master plan is probably already in the workings with the commission, I'm sure, but there's no reason why there shouldn't be a line item in the budget to support performances. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2353.132s">Also,</a> an issue that's been around for a number of years is there's no air conditioning in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2358.595s">So</a> you can take out three, four, five months out of the year that it's very difficult to bring in acts <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2364.981s">when</a> there's not air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2366.822s">And</a> that's a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2369.323s">I</a> know there's been discussion about the facade and other aspects of the building that need to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2376.947s">But</a> really, until the city steps up to the plate, and after three master plans for the revitalization of Medford Square that mentioned Chevalier as an economic engine for the revitalization of Medford Square, three master plans <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2394.428s">You</a> would think someone in the Office of Community Development would have read it and said, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2399.573s">What</a> a gem we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2400.855s">Look</a> at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2401.756s">It's</a> standing right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2402.617s">We</a> have a building that potentially could bring in thousands of people a week into our community and provide foot traffic throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2411.246s">And</a> nothing has been done by this administration for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2415.065s">Nothing</a> has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2416.646s">And,</a> you know, we could talk about other areas, but Lowell did it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2421.089s">Lowell</a> provides seed money for their auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2424.231s">They</a> bring in a lot of top-notch performances. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2429.035s">And</a> as I think it was Councilor Penta that mentioned it, it takes money to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2434.599s">So</a> if you don't want to invest into Chevalier, we're going to be stuck with the need to have improvements done to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2441.744s">And</a> I'm sure there's reasons why <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2443.757s">Performers</a> don't want to come here based on some of the things that we lack. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2447.859s">And</a> so this is the wish list I think we need to sit down with the commission and the friends and say, what do we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2453.822s">You</a> know, if we're going to have a chart the course and a capital improvement plan, it should include Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2461.525s">And</a> we should be able to look at it and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2463.773s">for</a> $150,000 or $200,000 or whatever it might be, the figure, this is what we'll need. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2469.137s">And</a> based on this, we believe we can bring in these many more performances. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2473.401s">Based</a> on this, we believe that it could be used for other purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2476.783s">And,</a> you know, it was talked about, I think, John Veneziano and some people talked about movie night there a while back. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2484.629s">And</a> I think that's a terrific idea for kids that are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old that really have nowhere to go in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2492.24s">after</a> 7, 8 o'clock, and would love to see a movie in their own town, to go in there and see a movie on a giant screen in an old-fashioned theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2501.204s">And</a> as was mentioned, that night, I had several people come up to me and say, this is the first time I've ever been in this building, and I've been here my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2509.227s">Not</a> that they didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2510.528s">It's</a> just the first time they've been in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2513.249s">And</a> I think that speaks volumes to where this city has Chevalier on a priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2520.051s">And</a> I'm hoping that changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2521.702s">come</a> January of next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2523.984s">And</a> I'm hoping that this city wakes up and realizes that we have a gem in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2529.247s">And</a> we really do need to step up to the plate, Mr. President, and put our money where our mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2535.152s">And,</a> you know, we don't need three reiterations of an economic revitalization plan to tell us that this is a true gem in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2544.678s">We</a> should all realize that, and I think we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2547.12s">I</a> just want to thank Mr. President, if I could, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2550.069s">because</a> the Friends just passed out a pamphlet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2554.891s">And</a> I just want to mention the co-presidents, Cindy Watson and Mike Cerullo, they do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2561.735s">The</a> treasurer, Kenneth Krauss, watches every penny that's going through the Friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2566.517s">And</a> then you have board members, May Makibrek, who was one of the founding members. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2570.339s">Representative</a> Donato, Susan Fairchild, who's been a very active and involved member and now part of the Chevalier Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2577.262s">Russ</a> Rossetti, who's been on the Chevalier <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2579.536s">a</a> number of years, and Keith Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2582.178s">And</a> they do a tremendous job in trying to solicit funds and keep that building up to where it should be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2589.623s">The</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4299.241s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4300.582s">And</a> first, I'd like to thank the city administration for sending out, at the request of this council, a reverse 911 to notify residents <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4311.44s">of</a> Eversource's presence here tonight to explain the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4315.841s">Although</a> the reverse 911 went out today, it was still notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4321.302s">So</a> I just want to thank the administration for sending that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4325.003s">At</a> the last meeting, I believe it was back in May, that you were before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4329.784s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4331.405s">There</a> were several questions asked that I don't believe we've received responses to. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4337.918s">Which</a> questions are those? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4339.42s">There</a> was probably a dozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4341.904s">Maybe</a> the city clerk can get the papers from that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4345.53s">They</a> weren't responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4346.671s">Some</a> of it was because of the fact that I guess much of the design has not been done.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4380.216s">So</a> the question I posed back in May <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4382.407s">was</a> the fact that this project is roughly 3.2 miles through our portion of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4390.529s">And</a> along that 3.2 miles, there'll be an eight inch steel pipe, 24 inch wide by 60 inch deep trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4401.471s">The</a> full length of this 3.2 miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4404.712s">And</a> the concern I raised at the time is approximately 17 manholes <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4411.025s">uh,</a> will be neat to install. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4413.666s">And</a> that's for the whole entire project or just within the city of method.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4421.428s">So</a> at the time I asked how many manholes will be installed within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4425.429s">It's</a> my understanding that at least 10 by 10, uh, and, um, and they're going to be anywhere from 2000 to 2400 linear square feet apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4434.892s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4440.677s">Do</a> we have an idea where these 10 by 10 manholes are going to be located?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4457.892s">So</a> you do know where currently you plan on putting them?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4467.658s">Because,</a> in my opinion, the 3.2 miles of the 24 inch by 60 inch deep is going to be a huge inconvenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4477.063s">But</a> these manholes are going to be a giant inconvenience on our roads, on roads that, if you go through in the morning, you'll realize just even trying to get your kid up to Medford High School in the morning is a task in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4492.212s">And</a> I think I asked at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4495.61s">It</a> was going to be along the curbing, I believe the gentleman said, with the underground trench that was going to be dug. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4502.431s">It</a> was going to be close to the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4504.572s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4592.364s">So</a> based on what you have to design right now, where will the eight inch pipe steel pipe be located?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4642.39s">So</a> a typical trench, would that be located in the middle of the street or towards the curb?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4652.176s">So</a> from what you're telling me in a 3.2 mile stretch, uh, we, we could have an obstacle course. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4657.92s">Uh,</a> our streets could turn into an obstacle course because you have piping that goes across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4663.383s">You</a> might have a trench that's located on the other side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4666.565s">It</a> doesn't seem to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4669.088s">It's</a> systematic.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4695.898s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4696.318s">I'm</a> talking about the trench itself.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4699.776s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4700.056s">So</a> if you have a trench that's 10 by 10, and what's the average street width on Winthrop Street?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4713.942s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4714.422s">I'm</a> talking about the manholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4715.743s">The</a> manholes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4726.508s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4727.17s">So</a> if you were gonna put that in the middle of the street, you're talking probably, no matter how quickly you work and how efficiently you work, lots of detours.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4742.198s">What's</a> the average width of just say Winthrop Street down towards the Winchester line?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4751.203s">You</a> don't know what the average is? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4752.164s">Is</a> it 20 feet wide? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4752.584s">Is</a> it 25?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4780.24s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4781.46s">You</a> know, I just think at some point, I realize you're only 50% there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4785.39s">But</a> at some point, we really need to see some type of, and I know the project's slated for 2017, but I really, and the reason why we called for this meeting, I know members have been thanking Eversource for coming up, but we actually requested that you come up here.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4801.273s">Right,</a> and provide a presentation, and I'm happy you came up, and honestly, I've been very pleased with the outreach and the documentation we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4811.454s">But</a> I think at some point, as a member of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4814.725s">because</a> I'm receiving the phone calls and emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4817.607s">Uh,</a> you know, people would like to know what's going to happen and you know, they're curious about the project, but they want to know what's going to happen in front of the house and you can't blame them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4827.294s">And</a> that's why I'm trying to get more specifics so we can tell people, uh, you know, on this stretch, you may have a manhole on this stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4836.341s">You're</a> not going to have a manhole, but you're going to have just the trench or, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4840.874s">So</a> when do you think we'll be able to see that prior to the construction?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5000.321s">Right</a> now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5001.781s">Uh,</a> I read online that the Winchester project, which is about a third smaller than our project in terms of length, uh, was expected to take place within a six month construction period. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5015.808s">Is</a> that going to be comparable on our side? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5018.99s">Can</a> we take the six months and say, well, we're a third larger? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5023.133s">It's</a> going to be roughly, you know, eight months?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5069.152s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5069.972s">But</a> the, the length of the project is anticipated two years altogether, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5074.873s">Is</a> that 17, 18? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5076.374s">Is</a> that the ballpark? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5078.074s">Entirety</a> of the project, including substation work, the entirety of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5082.068s">So</a> is it safe to say, because of how you're going to do the work, that it's possible that our roads will be under some sort of construction for two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5091.151s">I</a> wouldn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5092.892s">Well,</a> what can you give us? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5095.312s">You</a> know, I realize on your end, you're going to try to do it the most efficient and probably cost-effective way. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5100.614s">And</a> on our end, I want to see you come in and get out of our city, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5105.176s">And,</a> you know, so it's not advantageous for us or the residents or our traffic, so it's cost-effective for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5112.2s">to</a> be here for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5113.721s">So</a> I wanna see you do your work and get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5116.561s">Just</a> so you know that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5119.502s">You</a> may or may not, but the city of Cambridge right now is putting a moratorium on any openings of their streets for non-emergent purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5130.266s">And</a> I'm not sure what this project would be classified as, but it begs to be looked at because as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, our roads have been dug up so many times <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5142.66s">Not</a> just for underground utilities, but for other reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5146.162s">We</a> have mains from the MWRA that run and feed other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5150.705s">And</a> we're constantly under construction in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5153.407s">And</a> the Winthrop Circle, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, has really borne the brunt for the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5159.551s">So,</a> you know, I realize the overall project is to help with, you know, electricity for communities that are further out.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5184.354s">And</a> just the last point, Mr. President, I'd like to make, and again, I thank Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5187.877s">You</a> know, the project slated for 2017, 2018, we're trying to get a handle, and I can appreciate the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5196.403s">I</a> do have an issue with the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5199.258s">negotiating</a> mitigation, a mayor that's going to be leaving in a couple of months, and the project doesn't start until 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5208.46s">And</a> the next mayor come this January might have very different ideas on mitigation and what they may want to do to Winthrop Street and some of the areas that are impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5218.241s">And,</a> you know, I'm not quite sure why the mitigation, although I think it's warranted, has to be discussed with this current mayor at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5228.933s">And,</a> you know, I'm not sure how other councilors feel, but I truly think this should be an issue that is confronted with the next mayor and their vision and their ideas that they have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5243.039s">And</a> on that note, I'd just like to thank Eversource again for appearing.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6528.832s">Just</a> one last question, if I have a source. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6532.615s">I</a> don't think we discussed the potential disruption to driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6538.079s">There's</a> many driveways along the <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6540.194s">uh,</a> course of this route. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6542.536s">Um,</a> and, uh, will residents be notified that they won't have access to their driveway for particular periods of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6550.021s">I'm</a> sure during the construction, there may be hours and hopefully just a few hours that they won't have access. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6557.346s">How</a> will that notification, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6558.962s">be</a> sent to residents.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6584.506s">So</a> what do you anticipate?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6633.468s">So</a> residents will have access to their driveway throughout this whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6637.322s">There</a> won't be any interruption.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6675.666s">So</a> when the machine's doing the digging, you're talking a good hour and a half maybe in front of a driveway then? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6680.911s">The</a> length of a driveway, five, six feet? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6682.693s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6683.273s">You're</a> talking a good hour, an hour and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6686.396s">I</a> would just...
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6827.489s">I</a> think we have one more point, Mr. Chairman.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6889.043s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6891.424s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6892.945s">The</a> utilities now are assessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6895.126s">So</a> what was the assessment for the City of Method, do you know?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6947.443s">The</a> Vice President Thank you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7929.635s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7931.075s">I</a> have an update on the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7934.576s">I</a> know it was mentioned by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7938.417s">Last</a> night at the school committee meeting, we were invited by the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7945.457s">And</a> when I say we, it was Leonard Design Associates, who is the site planning and landscape architect for the dog park, along with Paws for Method, which was the committee that was created of a group of interested citizens in creating a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7966.155s">And</a> we appeared before the school committee last night <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7969.934s">to</a> discuss the potential site for the dog park, which is Riverbend Park along the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7979.476s">And</a> where it's on school property, we needed school committee approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7985.138s">And</a> I'm pleased to announce that the school committee voted unanimously for approval of this particular park. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7992.96s">If</a> anyone's interested in looking at the schematic presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7997.974s">that</a> was presented last night, if you didn't catch the school committee, you can go on pause, the number four, medford.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8005.718s">So</a> it's pause, the number four, medford.org, and you can also leave a name and email address on the site and you will be receiving updates of anything that goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8018.425s">There's</a> a timeline of the project and where the two particular parks, there's gonna be a small dog park <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8028.322s">and</a> a large dog park for larger dogs on the site itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8034.225s">A</a> lot of time and effort went into this particular proposal from the Dog Park Advisory Committee, who created the website on their own, at their own expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8046.011s">The</a> members of the committee are Patty Flynn, Jim Silva, Diane Gitner, Britt Fitch, Gary DeStefano, John Sardone, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8055.664s">and</a> this group was established in November of last year, and to date, we have brought on board a landscape and site plan design person who put together this schematic presentation last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8072.188s">I</a> asked the gentleman, along with the other committee members, to appear before the Medford City Council in the next several weeks to give us the presentation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8083.712s">Come</a> this November, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8085.832s">The</a> committee will be applying for a grant through the Stanton Group, which is a private foundation that funds dog parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8094.257s">They</a> funded dog parks in Somerville and in Arlington at no expense to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8100.781s">And</a> they will also fund maintenance and upkeep for a period of time, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8106.704s">I</a> believe it was in Arlington they funded, I think it was $20,000 for a three-year period for the upkeep. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8113.669s">This</a> particular site is handicap accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8116.67s">There's</a> lighting in the area, so we don't have to have a great expense to add lighting to the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8123.132s">There's</a> water in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8124.332s">They're</a> going to have obstacle courses for the dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8127.974s">It's</a> going to be a real great, great top-notch dog park in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8133.816s">And</a> we are projected for hopefully a grand opening sometime in maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8141.987s">July,</a> August, September of next year, if everything goes well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8146.371s">And</a> that includes approval from the grant, the Stanton Group, and any other design things that need to be worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8156.679s">But</a> I just want to update the Council, and I will invite at a future meeting within the next several weeks for a PowerPoint presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8164.686s">It's</a> a rather short presentation, but it's really been a labor of love. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8171.05s">for</a> many residents in this community and long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8175.034s">Uh,</a> if we all recall the fast 14 bridge project that took place, the mayor negotiated as part of the mitigation $60,000 for the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8184.402s">And</a> we are using some of that money now to bring on this Leonard design associates, uh, to pay for this initial schematic, uh, design that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8193.43s">So,</a> um, I look forward to this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8196.559s">in</a> the next several weeks, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8419.262s">I'd</a> be remiss if I didn't mention, uh, the, uh, the Crystal Campbell dedication that took place, uh, on Sunday, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8427.602s">It</a> was a real heartfelt event and well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8432.864s">And</a> the administration did a tremendous job putting this together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8438.025s">And</a> I just want to say it really put our city in a great light and is a real tribute to this community and how we honor our residents, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk/2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk.html">Medford City Council - August 11, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=692.739s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=693.74s">I,</a> too, have received the same complaints and concerns and want to thank my two colleagues for bringing this up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=701.163s">I</a> think it's great that we get a correspondence back from the Director of Medford Housing, but I think it's only appropriate with the seriousness of these particular complaints that the Housing Director appear before the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=714.51s">If</a> you choose executive session, that'd be fine with me or here at the council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=722.183s">I</a> think it's only appropriate that he appear before us, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=734.954s">That's</a> perfect.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2010.744s">I</a> appreciate what Councilor Penta had to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2013.165s">However,</a> I know there are people here from the Garden Club, and it may be interesting to find out what the current expenditures are, the number of plots, and based on that information, because if we have a figure of 10,000 that's currently in the ordinance, to go down to 3,000 if they're already expending 5,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2030.65s">It</a> doesn't make any sense to me, so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2940.417s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2941.417s">And</a> I'm not sure if this is an appropriate question to the city solicitor or maybe someone from the guiding club, but the way I understand it right now, the Riverbend Park <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2951.48s">for</a> many years had a waiting list. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2953.382s">And</a> I'm glad to see this program expand to other parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2956.644s">We</a> do have 26 parks in the city, many of which are underutilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2961.949s">But</a> currently, I guess I'd like to find out if there is a waiting list, just say at the Riverbend Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2968.354s">And</a> under this particular ordinance, if I was on the waiting list at Riverbend Park and not knowing anything about fees or anything else at that park, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2978.969s">And</a> an opening came up at McNally or Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2983.053s">Am</a> I eligible to fill that opening? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2986.316s">Would</a> I have to pay the fee that's dictated by the commission based on Winthrop Street and McNally?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3059.582s">What</a> is that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3060.362s">I'm</a> sorry, I didn't get the last.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3078.512s">That's</a> what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3079.412s">But</a> if you're following their, from what we just heard, their rules and regulations and <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3083.943s">trying</a> to mirror exactly what they're doing, then why wouldn't it be a combined effort? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3088.664s">And</a> why would there be a separation?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3124.273s">So</a> there'll be an ability to cross-pollinate memberships?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3140.282s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3142.783s">And</a> just if you could, just because I've seen the McNally and also the Winthrop, how many plots are at Winthrop?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3159.354s">And</a> McNally Park?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3166.298s">Four.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3167.417s">And</a> are they roughly the same square footage?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3178.02s">And</a> as an organization, how do you control the use of water within any of these sites?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3199.465s">Is</a> it metered?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3228.149s">I</a> just think maybe for future reference, it may be worthwhile for your group or even this council recommend that a meter be put in just to safeguard the group and to make sure that it'll be a way of tracking year after year to see what's currently used. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3243.453s">Because</a> as you know, that is considered unaccounted for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3247.467s">And</a> we all pay for that as rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3250.468s">And</a> I think it's a great use and it's worthwhile, but I think there needs to be a way of seeing what's being used and also the ability to control it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3259.77s">But</a> I applaud everyone for their work on an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3263.912s">As</a> you can see, I'm sure a lot of time and effort went into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3267.153s">And</a> it's easy to pick it apart, but I know there's a lot of work that went into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3272.174s">And</a> I look forward to the eventual expanding of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3276.73s">I</a> remember the days of the Victory Gardens on Grove Street, and there had to be 100 plots in there, and it was real bustling. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3284.434s">And</a> I would love to see this expanded in other neighborhoods where people can walk down and do their own garden.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3295.379s">Thank</a> you for your involvement.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3662.394s">A</a> question for the speaker from Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3666.096s">You</a> may not know, but what is the current waiting list at Riverbend? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3669.738s">Do</a> you know?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3713.183s">Are</a> there any provisions that would have people maybe have a lot for a year, two year, three year, and have to turn it over?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4883.667s">Just</a> if I could, because I agree on all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4886.988s">If</a> the Riverbend group wants to stay separate right now at this particular point, there is no animosity among the groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4895.932s">The</a> friends are fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4899.153s">I</a> don't see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4900.053s">The</a> city is not supporting the Riverbend and they're not supporting <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4905.835s">the</a> friends other than allowing to use city land, then I don't see this disparity that one speaks about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4915.463s">And</a> I see it as different organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4918.165s">We</a> have little leagues that are different in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4920.847s">We</a> have football leagues that are different in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4923.95s">And</a> I don't see this as any different for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4926.672s">And</a> maybe someday they'll join together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4930.215s">So</a> I would support leaving it as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4933.097s">I</a> can't support right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4935.322s">the</a> amendment that Councilor Camuso put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4939.065s">I</a> think it has some valid points, but at this particular time, there's no one in opposition, and I don't see why I'm going to create opposition when there seems to be harmony among the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4952.434s">So</a> I just want to go on record, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5758.513s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5760.454s">Because</a> the gentleman brings up a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5763.335s">And</a> as I've stated in the past, our parks, in my opinion, are underutilized right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5769.017s">And</a> I think all you have to look at is what Lowell did during their revitalization of their downtown business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5776.06s">They</a> also included their many parks throughout the city of Lowell that were in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5781.742s">And</a> residents got together, and in some parks, they built little performance stages <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5788.071s">and</a> did nifty artwork around the perimeter of the park with steel and metal and really made it an inviting and attractive place for residents to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5798.754s">And</a> they're seeing these parks now gone from drug dens, to be quite honest with you, and places that were in disrepair to places where there's performing arts right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5810.992s">And</a> it's used as a community gathering spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5815.015s">And</a> we right now in this community don't have many of those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5819.018s">And</a> I think what the gentleman just mentioned about bringing some life back into our parks is a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5826.463s">And</a> I look forward to that discussion in the future.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6039.555s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6040.856s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6041.937s">Thank</a> you both for your diligence in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6045.78s">You</a> have an opportunity now to give out a website or any way of people sending a donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6053.575s">So</a> at this point, if you could do that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6084.163s">Thank</a> you for all you do.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7363.446s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7364.467s">Thank</a> you, Patty, for coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7367.673s">I</a> think Councilor Knight just hit the nail on the head to get the information on the number of business permits that are out there and how many are being sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7374.721s">But</a> also, and we have the Chief in the audience, I was under the impression that only Medford residents can get commuter parking stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7383.691s">Is</a> that still true, Chief?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7410.965s">They're</a> not selling them to anyone outside the community?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7447.986s">But,</a> Chief, what I'm getting at is if the intent is to have business owners be able to park and Method residents be able to have commuter parking, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7456.998s">and</a> we're selling them to people outside the community, which I'm led to believe is happening now, then that takes from business owners, because we can shift, you know, if we don't have enough people going for commuter parking that live in the city, and there's an overflow of people outside the community that can come in and buy passes, that defeats the whole purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7478.443s">And</a> I'd rather see a business owner that can take that spot rather than an outside commuter.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7491.039s">But</a> that's one area.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7505.97s">What</a> about along Playstead Road?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7524.538s">I</a> think we're going to find chief and this has nothing to do with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7528.123s">they're</a> overselling these business permit parking stickers.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7535.224s">Don't</a> forget, the mayor's original plan was to charge $400 for a business permit parking sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7540.706s">And</a> when the businesses heard that, they were outraged.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7553.776s">I</a> have a tough time believing nothing happens without the mayor's input.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7560.202s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7561.623s">But</a> I think now what we're seeing is the fact that they had to lower it to the $100, they figure they'll just sell four times more the passes and make up the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7572.353s">But</a> if you could check into that, Chief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10364.809s">On</a> the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, as amended, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10373.956s">Just</a> if I could, because I have a lot of respect for Dr. Starella and his eagle eye for <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10381.865s">budgetary</a> concerns in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10383.626s">I</a> think I'm struggling with the same thing, doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10387.649s">We</a> had a conversation prior to the council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10391.911s">And</a> I appreciate the fact that you're saying the 0% interest loans that the MWRA offers is all the community's money combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10405.359s">And</a> you're right, because the MWRA doesn't generate money on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10411.618s">rates</a> and through charging communities rates for water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10416.62s">So</a> you're right, that pool is money that's out there that's generated from my water and sewer consumption, your water, everyone, and not just in Method, throughout all the MWRA district. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10430.184s">And</a> you're absolutely right with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10432.185s">And</a> my only concern is that if there is a grant out there, and at the end of this all being said and done, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10441.275s">Dr.</a> Estrella, and I know what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10446.579s">$954,000</a> of this project will not be taken from our $6 million reserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10453.164s">It'll</a> be given to us by the MWRA, which is money from all the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10458.788s">I</a> see that as a win for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10462.738s">It's</a> no different, in my opinion, when we built the new schools in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10467.063s">You</a> could say the same thing with the reimbursement we got from the state, the state building assistance program with the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10473.872s">Why</a> would the state come in and give the city of Medford 90% to build new schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10478.386s">And</a> you're right, that's every taxpayer in the commonwealth's money that's in that state building assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10483.868s">But</a> why as a community wouldn't we take advantage of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10487.849s">And</a> that's the only issue I'm struggling with. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10491.17s">Why</a> wouldn't we take advantage of the grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10495.992s">I</a> realize we paid into it, Malden paid into it, Somerville paid into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10500.073s">Everyone</a> paid into it, but why wouldn't we try to get our fair share of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10504.514s">Rather</a> than saying, you know what, we can afford out of the excess we have in the water and sewer, the surplus from all the rate payers paying too much for water and sewer over the years, we can take that $2 million out without a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10516.436s">That'll</a> leave us with $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10518.197s">I'm</a> saying, let's only take $1,166,000 and let the MWRA give us the balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10524.658s">Have</a> to take the whole $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10526.938s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10527.439s">And</a> then we get reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10528.759s">And</a> then we get reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10531.986s">I</a> just think it's a difference of opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10534.007s">I</a> really — I can't leave that on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10538.11s">I</a> can't leave that on the table and say, okay, we can afford it, let's do it on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10543.733s">And</a> I'd take it one step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10545.494s">I</a> don't even agree with saying that's paid off right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10548.396s">If</a> I'm not paying interest on that, why would I — if I had money in the bank and I don't have to pay interest on purchasing something, why wouldn't I want to leave that money in the bank collecting interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10560.049s">It</a> just, I don't know, I have some real concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10564.011s">As</a> Councilor Knight mentioned, I've been talking about water and sewer infrastructure since I've been on the council, 14 years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10572.574s">And</a> I've been talking about the lack of infrastructure because it's under the ground and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10576.696s">I've</a> been talking about INI, inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10579.277s">And</a> you're correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10580.437s">And</a> so I know these projects are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10582.838s">I</a> think you know and I think everyone behind this reeling realize these projects are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10587.08s">With</a> this particular project, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10588.543s">We</a> have catch basins right now that are supposed to collect runoff rain when it rains out and sends it to the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10596.506s">We</a> have them directly connected to our sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10599.947s">So</a> anytime it rains, rather than that go out to the Mystic, we're taking it and sending it out to Deer Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10606.31s">So</a> you can imagine the volume. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10608.971s">We</a> have about 16 connections in the community right now that are directly connected to our sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10614.693s">This</a> is going to address six of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10616.694s">Now,</a> it's not all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10617.713s">but</a> it's going to address a portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10619.494s">We're</a> making some headway in the community on infrastructure that's been neglected for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10625.415s">If</a> the mayor can neglect a building that we can see, imagine what he's neglecting under the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10630.357s">There's</a> no argument there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10632.077s">You</a> know, so, but these are the things that, you know, I just, I just have a problem with not going after a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10642.481s">And</a> I know what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10643.641s">There's</a> nothing free in this world. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10645.722s">It's</a> a grant out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10647.298s">that</a> we could take advantage of, and it doesn't — that $954,000 will not come out of our surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10655.043s">And</a> under your thinking, it will come out of the surplus.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10691.319s">It's</a> everyone's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10692.66s">It's</a> 54 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10694.842s">So</a> it's not just the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10696.163s">That</a> wasn't money put aside just for the city of Medford.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10708.593s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10709.273s">I</a> can't dispute that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10710.714s">So</a> it's all money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10711.814s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10712.314s">And</a> so was the building of new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10713.875s">It</a> was our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10714.495s">So</a> I guess we didn't get 90 percent on the dollar with the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10718.417s">And</a> maybe we should raise taxes in the community to raise that hundred and something million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10724.04s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10724.781s">We</a> thought better of it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10945.158s">Mr.</a> President, could we just allow a citizen to speak?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11634.27s">Motion</a> for approval.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11925.121s">Is</a> the plan for you?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12190.759s">Does</a> that have to pass practice if there was a tree around to use a tree? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12195.243s">Why</a> would it be connected to a tree?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12217.046s">Right,</a> but how did it first get installed on a tree?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12223.451s">So</a> that's not the practice to <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12225.428s">put</a> a guide wire into a tree?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12231.291s">So</a> at some point you did?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12233.352s">At</a> some point you did put guide wires to trees?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12426.727s">When's</a> the last day to get an absentee ballot, Mr. Clerk?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12446.985s">The</a> last day you can obtain one?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12463.171s">Probably</a> before. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12466.252s">Eddie,</a> did you say- Supposed to get it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12467.912s">Right,</a> when's the last day to submit it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12477.104s">Up</a> until August 31st?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12487.551s">But</a> if you mail it on that day, you're not going to get it for that election. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12490.693s">So</a> would he count it the following? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12492.514s">No,</a> I'm kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12493.295s">Postmark.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12496.097s">So</a> that's what I'm trying to figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12497.577s">So</a> when's the last day that someone can submit something to the clerk's office? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12502.955s">So</a> it would be counted.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12530.132s">So</a> if it's postmarked September 1st, you'll take it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12838.256s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12839.256s">My</a> resolve is regarding Winthrop Circle and to clarify some of the confusion that's out there regarding the entering of the circle itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12852.079s">So</a> I would just ask that yield signs be posted at Winthrop Street Rotary on the approaching roads and that a sign be placed inside the circle facing Route 38 North that says Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12866.393s">So</a> people that are coming up realize it's a rotary, and that may help with some of the confusion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13009.142s">You</a> see a 10 on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13009.982s">Where</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13010.442s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13010.842s">I</a> have 22 by Marks and then 10 by Penta.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13222.646s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13224.147s">I'm</a> sure many other councils received the same phone calls and emails regarding a meeting that was held here at City Hall several weeks back by Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13235.316s">It</a> was a combined meeting of Somerville, Winchester, and Medford because this particular two and a half mile stretch of an underground utility <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13246.362s">impacts</a> several communities, and residents that attended from the city of Medford were quite disappointed to see that Somerville had representation from the city administration, Winchester had someone from their town hall, and the city of Medford did not have one person from the administration representing the community and the residents regarding this major problem project. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13276.731s">that's</a> going to cut through Winthrop Street and down South Street, down Mystic Ave, through the heart of our community and disrupt the roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13288.298s">In</a> particular, as we all know, Winthrop Circle that's been under repair for the last two and a half years, they're going to re-dig this road up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13296.903s">And</a> there are still a lot of outstanding questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13300.585s">This</a> council put a resolution on several weeks back <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13304.738s">And</a> many of us asked representatives from Eversource a number of questions, of which we have yet to receive any responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13312.46s">So</a> I had asked through this resolution that we have a full-blown public hearing on Tuesday, October 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13322.583s">That</a> gives Eversource time to prepare. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13325.484s">It</a> gives the city time to send out a reverse 911 call to residents that are impacted by this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13332.966s">And</a> it not only impacts <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13334.672s">residents</a> along the roadway, but it's going to impact traffic for every resident in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13341.014s">And</a> I think we have to start talking about mitigation, which I haven't heard anything in regards to that as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13349.717s">And</a> what's going to be done regarding the traffic and how it's going to impact the Craddock Bridge project, because we all know it's coming down South Street, and that's just a stone's throw from the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13364.861s">at</a> the very tip, and I would ask that this be supported by the council and sent to the mayor for action, Madam President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13378.53s">Roll</a> call vote, Madam President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_F9Dj7AZRD7I/2025-03-21_F9Dj7AZRD7I.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 30, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=970.913s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=973.38s">Regarding</a> the phase one, the move of the Verizon conduits, other than the conduits and the electrical conduits, what other wiring is currently underneath that bridge? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=992.975s">Can</a> you speak into the mic? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=994.036s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1032.955s">The</a> reason why I ask is when we were first presented the conceptual design and project back some time ago, it was stated to us that many members of this council asked why it would take so long to build a bridge, first of all, because of the impact to the business owners and also to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1052.804s">And</a> we were told that due to the extensive cabling that runs underneath the bridge, that alone was roughly about a year's worth of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1061.958s">And</a> some of us questioned why it would take a year to move wiring or temporarily relocate wires. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1069.781s">And</a> when I look through the different phases, it doesn't appear to be that extensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1075.783s">Is</a> that portion of the project changed?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1125.927s">So</a> you're saying then their work would take preference over your work? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1130.349s">Is</a> that, is that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1154.799s">So</a> for instance, when you look at phase one is to move Verizon conduits. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1160.661s">Then</a> it jumps to phase two, which is to install a temporary bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1165.304s">And</a> phase three is the demo and reconstruction of the west side of the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1168.925s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1169.926s">There</a> are no other water or other fiber optics under the west side?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1274.066s">So</a> just if I can interrupt, so the east side piping that we're looking at, telephone gas, is going to be moved to the west side temporarily?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1298.857s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1299.958s">So</a> if you look at phase three, November of 2015 to August 2017, that demo that says demo and reconstruction of the west side also includes the moving of any underground utilities.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1443.919s">And</a> I just have a few questions regarding when the bridge is demolished. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1452.465s">What</a> plans are there for pest control in the area? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1455.107s">Is</a> there any plans laid out by your company?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1477.334s">Have</a> the surrounding buildings been checked internally for any type of existing cracks or damage to foundations or so forth?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1523.651s">and</a> the owners of the property and also tenants will be notified?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1557.822s">Okay,</a> and what plans do you have for access to the businesses that'll be open during the construction period? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1567.966s">I</a> know you're gonna be removing sidewalks and a lot of construction in the area as well, construction equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1577.589s">Is</a> there any plans laid out to make sure people have access <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1580.671s">to</a> the businesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1581.772s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1615.298s">And</a> that leads to my next point about construction debris and also dust and dirt during the construction phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1623.983s">Will</a> there be power washing of buildings and windows? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1628.186s">How</a> frequent would that be?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1631.488s">You</a> don't intend to get them dirty?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1653.957s">But</a> in the event, for instance, a restaurant, if their window becomes so dirty that patrons don't want to go inside, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1663.409s">Are</a> you going to provide that type of pressure washing and daily maintenance of... Oh, I can't commit to that, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1672.397s">You</a> can't commit to that, but you said you're not going to have any dust.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1686.708s">Right,</a> but in the event that doesn't happen, you're saying that you're not willing to do it?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1702.931s">Well,</a> as part of the construction, there's also a process of cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1708.352s">There's</a> also a process of heavy equipment.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1712.853s">We</a> don't let debris collect. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1713.994s">OK,</a> so can you provide a number that someone can call if there's a concern?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1718.975s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1721.517s">Do</a> you have that now?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1725.38s">If</a> you can provide that, that'd be great.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1738.448s">And</a> just my last point, when will the typical hours be of construction?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1789.346s">And</a> is there any penalty if you don't meet your required deadlines?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1798.211s">That's</a> already been established?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1803.474s">Can</a> you also pass that along to the council?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1820.805s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1821.045s">Cause</a> I know what the fast 14 project there was well aware of that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1831.57s">And</a> is it seven days a week?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1848.765s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1849.846s">Mr.</a> President, just if we can get a copy of the contact number for local businesses and also residents that may have a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1857.893s">Will</a> that be manned around the clock, that particular line?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1868.22s">His</a> direct cell phone?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1869.78s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=1873.682s">You</a> can pass that along to the city clerk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5747.078s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5748.178s">And</a> I think the one thing we can do as a community is what you've seen over the last several weeks and what happened roughly a year ago and some other locations is these businesses want to stay under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5760.344s">They</a> don't want anyone to know what they're doing in these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5762.665s">And</a> that's why you see many of them with windows that you can't see through and, you know, shady activity going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5769.408s">And</a> it's very helpful when the community unites, like we're seeing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5773.978s">The</a> question I had, Chief, and I know there's ongoing investigations and so forth, but when you go onto a particular website of an establishment or on Facebook, and there's reviews about a particular business, and the reviews mention things that are against the law and so forth, what type of information do you need in order to really move this to the next level? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5800.011s">And</a> why does it seem that <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5803.381s">And</a> it's not a reflection on our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5805.162s">It's</a> probably happening everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5806.623s">Why</a> does it seem to take so long to investigate and move these businesses out of particular areas?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5934.404s">Uh,</a> is it within your powers to pay visits? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5939.596s">even</a> though there may not be anything substantial at the beginning?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6047.149s">Well,</a> thanks to your department and thanks to the vigilance of our residents, who are unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6054.593s">The</a> output that <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6056.059s">I'm</a> seeing just through emails and phone calls now is remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6060.082s">And</a> I think that adds a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6062.244s">I</a> stated it a couple of weeks ago, and I still believe it strongly, Chief, that, you know, when you have a downtown business district, not just Medford Square, many of our business districts right now that have a lot of vacancies, it doesn't look like there's much activity after 7 o'clock, and they become a welcoming zone for establishments like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6083.541s">And</a> I think the best thing we can do as a community <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6086.06s">It's</a> not just to be vigilant and let the police department know when we see this happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6090.823s">It's</a> also to promote our business districts, also to look at the revitalization of our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6096.966s">And,</a> you know, when you start seeing places like Best Sellers and Forest Street Art Studio go under, and you see pawn shops and massage parlors open up, it's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6110.373s">And</a> it should be a concern of every resident, as well as this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6114.961s">And,</a> you know, it's unfortunate, but I think as long as we stay ahead of the curve, we'll be all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=6122.386s">But</a> the revitalization of our business districts is key to keeping these type of establishments away and attracting businesses that are going to attract the type of clientele that we want to attract that's going to come around and spend money in our community and treat our business districts with the type of dignity and respect that it deserves.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9279.428s">There</a> are two different places?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9292.326s">On</a> the motion of council approval to table 15570, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9295.127s">Those</a> opposed?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11321.652s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11323.78s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11324.881s">And,</a> you know, as one member of the council, I'm glad we waited the one week to get responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11332.283s">We</a> did get a lot of responses in the last week to questions that we've asked during the countless hours we had with the budget director and also the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11346.088s">And</a> I think it was only appropriate that we took the time to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11350.17s">that</a> every single question was answered, so I'm grateful for that, and I'm grateful to all the responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11356.015s">You</a> know, I see it a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11358.077s">You</a> know, when you hear words like, we're gonna provide the same level of service we did last year, I don't know how that's supposed to give you a warm, fuzzy feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11370.028s">We're</a> gonna do what we did for you last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11372.209s">We're</a> not gonna improve, we're not gonna advance, we're gonna do what we did for you last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11377.156s">We're</a> going to charge you more taxes but provide you the same services we did you last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11382.92s">And</a> then when you look at the service, we talked about the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11386.423s">We've</a> talked about that office for 10 years now under this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11391.166s">Ten</a> years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11392.187s">They</a> have one and a half person in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11396.41s">We</a> talked to the director of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11399.532s">It</a> was one of the first times she actually opened up to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11402.534s">And</a> we asked her, what are your needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11404.215s">I</a> believe it was Councilor Penta that asked, what are your needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11406.96s">And</a> she said, you know what, in order to revitalize the square and do what we need, our office needs to do to move the city forward, it'd be nice to have a transportation planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11417.872s">It'd</a> be nice to have a community planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11420.034s">It</a> would be nice to have a grant writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11422.817s">Those</a> are the few things that are a staple in an office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11428.111s">in</a> order to look at revitalization and attract new business and new growth and new spending in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11435.253s">That's</a> what's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11436.493s">This</a> budget does not accomplish any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11439.914s">So</a> to sit here and say we're moving forward, where are we moving forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11444.274s">Same</a> level of service we're hearing, same departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11448.375s">Yeah,</a> have they sprinkled a few things here and there by osmosis? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11451.996s">Yes,</a> something's bound to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11454.797s">But</a> other than that, really, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11456.748s">You</a> know, we talked about a 311 system, a way residents can electronically report concerns for city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11468.373s">We</a> have yet, Somerville has it, Malden has it, Boston has it, Cambridge has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11473.215s">We</a> as a city have yet to implement any logical way residents can submit a service request in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11481.773s">And</a> it also helps the administration during budget time when you're able to take all these requests and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11488.034s">We</a> had 3,000 requests for forestry and only 50 requests for parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11492.716s">Let's</a> take the budget and let's increase our budget for forestry based on the requests we're receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11498.457s">There's</a> no tracking mechanism in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11501.898s">Honestly,</a> I don't know how it operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11503.678s">And</a> we're going to find out come January how this city operates, because it's been a lot of smoke and mirrors for many years in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11511.813s">The</a> 311 system works. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11514.154s">It</a> works in every other community, but except Method can't find the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11519.316s">I</a> don't know if we don't have the brainpower to implement it, or we don't have the will to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11523.898s">I</a> don't know what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11525.258s">But</a> every resident suffers because we don't have 311 in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11529.56s">You</a> know, we talked about the engineering department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11532.741s">The</a> engineering director came up, and she mentioned that they don't have data collection software. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11539.644s">They</a> have files and files of <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11542.064s">of</a> data that's not electronic. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11545.907s">They</a> can't find what's in these cabinets. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11548.549s">I</a> believe she said it was about $30,000 to implement a system where they can have a tracking mechanism for all the electronic documents they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11557.655s">That's</a> a small fee in a $150 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11562.519s">As</a> was mentioned earlier, there's one phone for four employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11565.641s">And</a> forget about voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11569.744s">The</a> mayor's against voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11571.421s">That's</a> how progressive we are in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11574.003s">He's</a> against voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11576.004s">They're</a> still using drafting tables as desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11579.326s">How</a> would you like to write on a drafting table all day? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11583.729s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11585.43s">But</a> these are the small requests that for some reason we can't get a handle on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11591.874s">You</a> know, during the budget, um, we had the council on aging in and I offered a motion to the budget because of <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11600.335s">the</a> involvement I see at the senior center across the street, we were told that there were 24,796 sign-ins by seniors for programming activities at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11616.645s">It</a> ranged from bingo, to dinner movie, to Zumba, to chair yoga, and the list goes on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11624.129s">They</a> only receive state funding for their programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11627.672s">We</a> asked that we set up, similar to what we did for the art community, $5,000 to provide for additional programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11636.278s">The</a> director told us she could use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11639.0s">Then</a> we were told, well, they also wanted the Council on Aging gave back money, transferred back money to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11645.765s">I</a> don't know, when I'm talking to a department head face to face, and they tell me $5,000 can go a long way for senior programming in the city, I tend to trust the department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11657.658s">I</a> tend to trust the department could use that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11660.579s">And</a> I think it's a shame that we got a response back that the mayor will take that under advisement in a program that's so utilized by thousands of seniors in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11670.623s">You</a> know, we heard from the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11675.585s">This</a> budget does not contain any money for new police vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11680.878s">Although</a> we have vehicles that have 250,000 miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11685.101s">These</a> vehicles operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11689.104s">Try</a> running your vehicle seven days a week, 24 hours a day with multiple drivers and see what happens to your vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11697.191s">They</a> don't last long. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11699.653s">The</a> chief asked for six marked vehicles and six unmarked vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11704.997s">That</a> is not going to be part of this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11708.039s">So</a> I don't know how excited I'd be <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11710.483s">about</a> this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11711.663s">It</a> doesn't include the very fabric of a community, which is public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11717.645s">Vehicles.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11718.625s">You</a> can have as many officers as you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11720.425s">If</a> you don't have the vehicle to take them to a scene or answer a call, then what good is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11725.426s">Talk</a> to the men and women in the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11727.587s">They'll</a> tell you about the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11729.207s">Take</a> a ride in the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11731.048s">I</a> challenge you to take a ride in the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11733.628s">They're</a> smelling exhaust fumes from some of these vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11739.462s">Then</a> we heard from the chief of the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11742.564s">He</a> asked for $2 million in station repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11745.966s">We</a> still can't get a repair list of what's needed from the last repairs that were done with that bonding money that Councilor Wongo just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11756.191s">You</a> know, it seems to me when you're talking about level services and complimenting the fact that level services are good news, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11769.115s">then</a> it seems to me the status quo is what's prevailing in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11774.556s">And</a> that's what's taking place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11777.476s">It</a> seems to me the status quo is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11780.277s">Hey,</a> look, we're doing what we did last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11782.877s">That's</a> unacceptable in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11785.138s">And,</a> you know, there are a lot of positive things. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11787.098s">We</a> heard from the superintendent of schools, and a lot of positive things are going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11791.859s">As</a> a former graduate of the vocational school, I'm happy with the direction Heidi Riccio's taking the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11798.373s">They're</a> adding a lot of program offerings to the vocational school, state-of-the-art offerings, which will attract kids back from Lexington Minuteman, which is costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars to send these outside placements. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11813.385s">We're</a> adding textbooks in the social studies department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11817.148s">Our</a> guidance department added an additional Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11820.05s">We're</a> looking at additional desk and chairs throughout the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11824.914s">As</a> Councilor Camuso mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11826.898s">The</a> city is providing a prevention outreach program coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11831.341s">We</a> recently put on a code enforcement officer that Councilor Caraviello has been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11836.645s">So</a> there are positive things happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11839.147s">I</a> just don't think it's enough to outweigh the current status quo in the way this city is operating, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11846.312s">I</a> am appreciative of everything that was sent from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11849.354s">I</a> think this budget process overall went rather smooth. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11853.417s">We</a> got our budget packages. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11855.568s">well</a> ahead of time, so it gave us ample opportunity to view them, which has always been a bone of contention with me and I know members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11864.413s">I</a> will support the budget here tonight, but I'm hoping going forward that the status quo and the fact that we're going to provide level services is no longer bragging right in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11878.9s">And</a> it should be something we frown upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11881.441s">And</a> I think it's a sad commentary when we have to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11885.083s">we're</a> providing the same services we did last year, knowing that in my opinion, a lot of those services are not accurate enough as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11894.008s">And</a> I really think it's a sad commentary, but I will support this budget here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11900.252s">And</a> I look forward to next year's budget and the discussion and dialogue over how we can improve our community <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11911.566s">have</a> a vision of community development, look at some of the needs, infrastructure needs that we have, discussion on a new police department, discussion on revamping our old fire departments, and looking at the roads and the sidewalks and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11928.633s">The</a> list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11929.893s">The</a> public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11930.994s">These</a> are the things that really I think we have to look at as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11936.236s">And</a> I look forward to those discussions next year.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14715.527s">I</a> just... No, Mike, we're talking about the substance.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16209.498s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16214.221s">I</a> think it's a shame that we're not talking about having a local access in a centrally located <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16220.472s">area</a> where residents of our community can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16223.614s">I</a> just think it's a real injustice to even discuss this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16226.516s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Musil, you may continue.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16617.956s">Mr.</a> President, enough with these personal attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16620.359s">They're</a> personal attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16624.785s">Enough</a> with the personal attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16626.226s">We're</a> here to do the people's business, not with the personal attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16633.355s">personal</a> tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16634.596s">We</a> don't need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16635.977s">You're</a> a lame duck councillor.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g/2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g.html">Medford City Council - April 21, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1524.054s">Why</a> don't we have the meeting and then a follow-up meeting, if necessary?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1531.216s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1532.576s">You</a> know, I agree that it's difficult to find parking, but at this late stage, to cancel a meeting that's been scheduled for several weeks, I think would pose a larger hardship on people that have already made it part of their calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1545.588s">I</a> would ask that we meet tomorrow night and also set up a meeting for the next few weeks after that to have a follow-up meeting also, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1555.775s">Just</a> if I could add my opinion, and I've been very consistent on this mayor's proposed parking plan from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1564.481s">And</a> it was actually myself and Councilor Penta, when the mayor presented his plan to us, asked for a plan of doing this in-house versus outsourcing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1575.544s">And</a> the mayor came back with a shoddy plan, in my opinion, that showed that it was far more expensive to take this parking program in-house than to outsource it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1586.347s">And</a> from the start, Mr. President, I, as one member of the council, thought that we could do this in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1593.789s">We</a> have the ability to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1596.17s">We</a> have crossing guards that already have uniforms and familiar with working on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1602.031s">We</a> have retired police officers that have expressed <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1604.839s">interests</a> to me and other members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1609.882s">Our</a> original view of this parking proposal was just to enforce existing signage, nothing more. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1618.626s">Pay</a> for parking was never a subject that was brought up to institute in this community until the mayor got hold of that particular idea and felt that the revenue, which we all want additional revenue, was the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1633.74s">in</a> this aspect and I believe firmly revenue is secondary when it comes to parking enforcement and the primary objective is to move cars along in the business districts and also to enforce resident permit parking in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1648.044s">So,</a> you know, from the get-go I have not been in favor of this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1655.654s">On</a> the flip side, and I stated this a couple of weeks ago, there are aspects of the program that currently exist, not to pay for parking aspects, but other aspects that are underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1666.599s">A</a> lot of time and effort went into them, and I think we can keep portions of the parking program without throwing the baby out with the bathwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1673.923s">So</a> I have been supportive from day one, taking this in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1679.065s">You</a> lose all local control, as we found out, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1682.794s">And</a> I said this seven months ago, actually even longer, eight months ago, even before the mayor signed a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1689.678s">Once</a> you hire an outside contractor, you lose all local control, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1694.961s">And</a> we're seeing that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1696.382s">We're</a> hearing from the public saying, well, how can they give out a ticket on a holiday? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1700.544s">And</a> how come they're giving out tickets when I have a permit sticker and they're still giving me a ticket on my own street? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1705.887s">How</a> come they're enforcing after hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1707.548s">How</a> come they're taking my money when the kiosks aren't supposed to accept money? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1711.469s">So</a> we're here on all these issues, and partly based on because we're dealing with an outside entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1717.391s">This</a> council also asked for financial reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1720.612s">And</a> I don't know if anyone else has received any reporting, but we have yet to receive one iota of financial reporting on this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1729.635s">And</a> that's a major concern, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1749.09s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1749.33s">So</a> we have not received it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1752.892s">So,</a> so at this point, uh, Mr. President, um, I, I support, uh, the, uh, resolution brought forward, uh, not only cause it's the right thing to do, but the fact that councilor Camuso and council Penter are both, uh, on the resolution as offering it, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1770.191s">to</a> me, is a milestone in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1772.854s">And</a> that is another reason why I will support this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1777.638s">And</a> it makes sense on behalf of this community, on the residents that I've spoken to, the hundreds of residents that have sent us emails, stopped me at Stop and Shop in the street, saying that they don't agree with this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1789.322s">The</a> business owners that are struggling now, hearing that customers are not going to come back because of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1795.885s">What</a> does that say to a small business? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1798.266s">What</a> does that say to a small business that, you know what, we don't care if people don't come back to your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1803.608s">We</a> have a parking <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1805.102s">plan</a> in place, and according to the mayor, it's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1809.144s">Well,</a> I would suggest to you, Mr. President, that it's not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1812.906s">People</a> in this community are struggling now with the program, and let's go back to the basics and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1819.23s">And</a> the basics would be, Mr. President, enforce the existing signage, look at the permit parking, and move forward after that, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3828.82s">The</a> Press Thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3831.082s">As</a> far as I'm concerned, a vote tonight to terminate the contract for breach of contract acts as a shot across the bow to this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3841.668s">And</a> I agree with the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3843.889s">We're</a> not going to solve all the issues tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3846.551s">However,</a> Mr. President, when the mayor was rolling out this plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3851.277s">He</a> didn't look for any advice, input, suggestions from any member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3856.76s">So</a> what would lead anyone to believe that when we sit down with the administration tomorrow and say, you know what, we're not happy with this plan, Mr. Mayor, we'd like to take it in-house, that we're going to get any different of feedback than we already received four or five months back saying, we don't need your involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3874.627s">And</a> that's what it was, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3877.289s">It</a> was the mayor stating to us that our input didn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3881.112s">And</a> I think what we're seeing now is that our input would have mattered because our input was talking about in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3888.517s">Our</a> input was talking about potentially no pay for parking at all or meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3894.021s">Our</a> input was talking about having kiosks in parking lots, not on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3900.666s">That</a> was our input, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3902.768s">And</a> it all fell on deaf ears at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3905.75s">So</a> I think this vote is critical tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3909.452s">And</a> honestly, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3911.01s">I</a> was prepared to take this vote eight weeks ago, along with my colleague, Councilor Penta, because at the time, Mr. President, you know, one incident doesn't sway me one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3923.94s">I</a> realize tickets were issued on a holiday, but this is compounded over weeks after weeks after weeks of running a program that, in my opinion, was not well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3936.53s">So</a> it wasn't one particular isolated incident that <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3939.462s">triggered</a> me off. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3940.642s">It</a> was a systematic neglect of running an appropriate program that led us to where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3947.545s">And</a> it's a shame, really, that the city of Medford has had to put so much time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3954.548s">And</a> eventually, if we do get out of the contract, you know, and if it's not breach of contract, there's going to be a sizable amount of money that this community is going to have to pay Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3967.319s">And</a> that's going to be a whole other issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3969.84s">But</a> I'm willing, at this point, based on what I've seen out of this particular group, Republic, and based on the current plans that the administration set forth for this parking program, I'm willing to sit down and listen to what the alternatives are and listen to potentially what it may cost this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3989.067s">Because,</a> hey, no one wants to talk about it, but there may be a financial cost to get out of this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3994.309s">But</a> I'm willing to listen to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3996.611s">I'm</a> willing also to keep aspects of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3999.634s">So</a> I think there could be some give and take on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4002.756s">There</a> are certain things I won't give, but there are other things I will give. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4006.56s">So</a> I think if we all get together, we can work on something that's amenable to the business community, residents alike, this council, the administration, and devise a program that will be suitable for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4020.332s">Not</a> Somerville, not Cambridge, not Malden, but for the city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4024.185s">and</a> how we want to see our community operated, and that is not aggressive enforcement, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5338.654s">Just</a> if I could, Matt, can you tell us what type of data you want entered into the city website?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5814.402s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5815.622s">And,</a> um, if I'm not mistaken, prior to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5819.347s">Channel</a> 3 going off air, they would also have on their website the last several months of the council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5827.332s">And</a> they started that towards the end of when Channel 3 went under. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5833.396s">But</a> it was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5834.717s">Residents</a> can go on and view any meeting and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5838.659s">I</a> think the issue, Mr. President, naturally we're not going to give anyone, Matt or anyone else, access to the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5846.364s">I</a> don't even have access to the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5848.389s">That's</a> by the web master and whoever has that dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5852.613s">Um,</a> and that's the way it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5855.396s">Uh,</a> but what I think Matt is saying, he wants to volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5859.279s">He</a> wants to get active in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5861.261s">He</a> wants to do something in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5863.863s">And,</a> uh, he's finding a hundred obstacles in order to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5869.068s">And</a> you know, the, the, the one thing that I have to say about this administration is <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5873.462s">The</a> mayor has failed over the years to tap the number one resource we have, which is our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5880.704s">And</a> that's a big failure because we have a lot of people out there with a lot of different job experiences that could help in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5891.128s">For</a> instance, one thing that comes to mind, just even the restroom here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5895.909s">You</a> know how many plumbers live in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5898.066s">that</a> if you approached him and said, hey, would you like to do something for the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5901.607s">Would</a> you like to donate your labor? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5903.647s">We'll</a> buy the pots. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5905.007s">You'd</a> be surprised how many people would come out of the woodwork to say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5908.628s">We'd</a> like to give back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5910.589s">But</a> you'd never hear of a volunteer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5913.949s">And</a> what Matt is trying to say is he'd like to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5917.11s">Whether</a> he's the one that puts those on directly or so forth, that's all semantics. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5921.971s">He</a> wants to give you the time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5923.952s">And</a> as a community, we should be welcoming that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5926.448s">And</a> our administrators should be reaching out to them and saying, Matt, this is what we'd like you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5930.929s">But</a> instead, every door is a closed door, which is unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5935.03s">But</a> I honestly think that this needs to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5941.432s">And</a> I think any avenue of transparency, and one is providing another avenue for our council meetings, is a great avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5949.874s">And</a> I don't think we can go wrong in doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5951.635s">So</a> I think we should take a vote here tonight, asking the administration to look into <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5956.4s">the</a> volunteer services that Mr. Lieberman wants to offer, and have them devise a program that safeguards the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5966.049s">No</a> one wants to jeopardize the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5968.231s">No</a> one's looking to put videos that make someone else look bad on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5971.093s">And</a> I don't want to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5972.335s">I'm</a> sure no one else behind this railing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5974.397s">But</a> there's a way to do it that I think makes sense and also involves people that want to get active in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5980.689s">And</a> once we start here, this is just the first step in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5986.932s">And</a> then we can open it up to volunteerism throughout the city, which currently we lack right now, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6056.78s">Labor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6057.481s">You</a> know, the council is one open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6059.742s">There</a> are other meetings that are held at city hall here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6062.004s">Uh,</a> that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6064.146s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6064.668s">information</a> for residents of this community, Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6068.45s">You</a> can have the Board of Appeals meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6070.37s">You</a> can have the Board of Health meetings, the Park Board meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6073.892s">There's</a> a lot that goes on in this city.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6181.912s">Mr.</a> President, maybe under the next administration, there will be an office of volunteerism, and we'll be able to tap our residents and our resources that currently exist and really bring some community pride back to this community, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=684.994s">And</a> you also have that 800 number if someone wanted a call to get some more information from?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=710.274s">Mr.</a> President, if I could just say, this has been a great event in the city for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=716.158s">It's</a> due to the many volunteers that get active and involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=720.861s">I</a> can't think of one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=723.34s">that</a> hasn't been impacted in one way or another by this awful disease, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=729.363s">And</a> it truly has no boundary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=733.184s">It</a> doesn't discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=735.005s">And</a> it's something that we have to snuff out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=738.847s">And</a> it's people like Debbie and the many volunteers that have put in countless hours trying to keep this in the forefront with all the different things that are out there and different <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=751.751s">people</a> pulled in different directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=753.732s">I</a> think this is such a worthy cause, Mr. President, that we have to do our best to make sure we can eradicate this awful disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=760.656s">So,</a> again, I thank you both, and I hope it's going to be a big success, which I'm sure it will.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=939.195s">Suspension</a> of the rules, so gentlemen would like to speak.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1551.752s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1552.913s">And</a> I thank my colleague for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1557.534s">However,</a> I'm not quite sure what the actual resolution would do to solve any concerns that we may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1567.748s">with</a> not getting a response from the administration, uh, which is, uh, a response that is set forth under section 55 of the charter, which requires the mayor to respond back to the council within 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1583.835s">Um,</a> if the mayor fails to respond back to the council, I'm not quite sure that having the paper then come back to the council and be sent to one of our subcommittees <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1596.155s">solves</a> any concern of anything at all, other than we just take the issue and take it off the mayor's plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1605.778s">My</a> personal opinion is if originally it was sent to the mayor, it was sent because we were looking for a response from the administration or a department head or something that needed intervention from the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1619.561s">And</a> to send it back to us to work on it again <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1626.011s">to</a> me makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1627.252s">I</a> think we should try to address the reasoning behind why we're not getting responses according to the city charter within a timely manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1636.76s">And</a> that would be the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1638.462s">And</a> furthermore, you know, the councilor is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1642.845s">And</a> it may be things that we're sending to the mayor that are rhetorical in nature that we're really not even looking for a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1650.432s">And</a> those things can be vetted out by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1653.585s">But</a> for the many resolutions that are sent to the mayor that go unresponded to, I'm not quite sure why we would want to welcome them back, put them in a subcommittee, for what purpose? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1666.349s">I'm</a> still not sure what that solves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1670.69s">If</a> we want to really address the issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1673.163s">We</a> should be sitting down with the mayor saying, Mr. Mayor, we expect under the city charter, and that's the rules that regulate how the city operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1682.868s">If</a> the mayor chooses not to operate under those rules, there's a larger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1687.251s">But</a> to try to circumvent the city charter and now take a paper that was originally sent to the mayor and say, well, we'll take it back because he never responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1697.818s">I'd</a> like to hear, I'm open for discussion and dialogue, but I'd like to hear how that helps the legislative process and how that helps move issues forward on behalf of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1709.426s">I</a> don't see that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1883.252s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could, you know, it's this council that takes a vote on whether we send a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1891.597s">It</a> has to be a majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1892.99s">to</a> the mayor, or whether we set up a committee of the whole meeting, or whether we send it to subcommittee, it's always this council that takes the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1901.374s">So</a> whatever has made its way to the mayor in the year 2014, which the councilor is talking about, was a majority vote of this council, saying we feel that this paper needs to go to the mayor for action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1915.471s">Now,</a> if the council decided, you know what, we don't feel that's the best avenue to send it to the mayor first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1921.774s">We</a> rather send it to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1923.614s">Then</a> it's under the purview of this council, which we do on many occasions, send it to subcommittee or committee the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1930.958s">So</a> I'm not, I'm still not quite sure taking a paper back that the mayor has not responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1938.221s">And,</a> and I might add a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1940.842s">And</a> I had a discussion just recently with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1944.043s">A</a> response of, I will take this under advisement, is a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1948.966s">You</a> may not like the response, but it's a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1952.669s">If</a> the mayor comes back and say, this is something I'm going to be working on, that's also a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1957.752s">And</a> we could go back and say, Mr. Mayor, we'd like to know what a time frame is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1961.254s">You</a> know, the 10 days no longer applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1963.255s">How</a> long you think you'll be working on this for? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1966.097s">So</a> there is that dialogue that could take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1969.484s">I</a> would just hate to see that this open up an avenue that the mayor, or not this mayor, or the next mayor, whoever it might be, say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1980.346s">The</a> city chart is requiring me to respond within 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1983.767s">However,</a> if I don't, the council's just going to take the paper back, they're going to send it to a subcommittee, and good luck to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1991.448s">See</a> what happens with that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1993.588s">The</a> slippery slope also is, and I'm not saying this will happen, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1997.973s">If</a> I had an issue that was near and dear to me, and it gets sent to the subcommittee that Councilor Caraviello sits on, along with two other members of the council, and they're not quite that hip on that issue that I'm hip on, that could sit in a burial for months and years in that subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2016.517s">And</a> I would have really no input on getting it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2019.858s">And</a> I'm not saying that's going to happen, but it would lend itself to that type of activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2028.463s">I</a> think the process that's in place, which was created by our forefathers of the city charter, definitely needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2037.669s">And</a> I've been one of the most active members of this council calling for a review of the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2043.832s">And</a> I've publicly stated what I think needs to be changed in the charter that hasn't been looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2049.355s">in</a> 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2051.495s">I</a> mean, what other document would you say that you established 28 years ago is still valid? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2056.936s">I</a> mean, no business plan would run on a business plan from 28 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2061.797s">No</a> private corporation or entity would work on such a plan, but the city of Medford has, in my opinion, has failed to look at the city charter in the past 28 years to bring it up to a day and age that we all know technology <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2079.277s">and</a> many other advances have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2081.598s">So,</a> you know, I appreciate what Councilman Light brings up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2085.859s">I</a> think it's part of the frustration that's been behind this reel on getting answers and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2091.701s">I</a> just don't like that particular avenue of getting to that approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2095.823s">I</a> think, honestly, whether it's this mayor or a future mayor, we have to follow the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2101.525s">And</a> as it reads right now, within 10 days, we should get a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2106.106s">And</a> I'm not going to go against the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2108.727s">If</a> that's the rule, then whoever the mayor is should adhere to that rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2112.869s">And</a> if they're not, maybe this council should stand up and take a vote of no confidence and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2118.893s">You're</a> not adhering to the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2120.934s">We're</a> not happy with the Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2123.235s">This</a> is a vote of no confidence to let you know things better change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2127.217s">But</a> to say, you know what, we'll just take the paper back and scurried into a subcommittee, uh, and let them work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2134.322s">You</a> know, it was sent to the mayor for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2137.242s">I'm</a> not quite sure that I can support that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2140.503s">I</a> would ask that we don't take a vote on this tonight and possibly this may be an issue that we want to discuss before one of the rules committee or one of the subcommittees that we have already established before we come up with such a major, it may seem like a minor piece of legislation, but it has a major profound impact on how this council runs and how we get <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2166.497s">questions</a> and answers from the administration, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2284.01s">Mr.</a> President,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2288.291s">There's</a> a thing called accountability too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2291.013s">And</a> I think we have to keep that in mind that, um, you know, uh, under the charter, the mayors accountable to respond back to this council and to remove that accountability, uh, and say that, uh, you know what, it's not important that the mayor respond back to us because we'll just take back any response we already sent to them and send it to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2310.629s">I</a> think sends the wrong message, not only to the members of this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2314.302s">but</a> to the entire community itself that the process is broken right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2318.765s">And</a> I can tell you as one member, the mayor came back to us several months back saying that if the council was interested in a dog park, they said, the mayor said, go out and find funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2331.072s">I</a> took the ball, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2333.154s">I</a> ran with the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2334.475s">I</a> organized my own committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2336.137s">We</a> went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2336.657s">We</a> found funding for a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2338.619s">So</a> I know how to get things done in the community, and I know how to pick up a phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2343.443s">I've</a> been doing this for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2344.964s">I</a> talked to the department heads, but we all know under the city charter, there's one chief executive officer in this community, and he controls <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2353.85s">a</a> lot of the strings and what goes on in this community, and we need his input, and we need his support, and to, I think, create an environment that the council will work in its own vacuum, and the mayor will do whatever he wants to do, and that's not the way city government should operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2372.916s">And</a> I don't think, I think it's well-intended, this resolution, but I don't think it suits any purpose other than, honestly, just lip service, and it's not gonna, in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2383.766s">do</a> anything to improve the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2385.828s">If</a> anything, it's going to hamper the communications between the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2389.77s">So</a> at this point, Mr. President, I would, after the gentleman speaks, I would respectfully ask that this issue be tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2400.579s">I'll</a> remove it until the gentleman speaks then, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2502.514s">Motion</a> to table, Mr. President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3195.353s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3197.075s">Last</a> week we had Mark Crowley from Boynton Road <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3201.785s">appear</a> before the Medford City Council along with some neighbors regarding 59 Boynton Road, a home that's been in terrible condition and been marked by the city as a home that should not be entered in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3221.591s">We</a> as a council asked for opinions from the city solicitor on a number of issues from the Board of Health, Karen Rose. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3230.104s">and</a> also Paul Mokey, the building commissioner, regarding what the next steps are on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3235.448s">And</a> I just want people to know that we did receive a lengthy and thorough explanation regarding many of our questions in our packet this week from Paul Mokey, the building commissioner, Karen Rose, and the city solicitor, Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3251.639s">And</a> according to my discussions recently with Mark, he thinks that the court process <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3259.962s">is</a> probably going to be another six to eight weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3263.565s">And</a> hopefully after that, Mr. President, when all the court issues are ironed out, that we'll be able to move forward with the seal of that property and eventually the either knocking the property down or the refurbishing of the home, if possible, to help out with the neighborhood and the residents that have to live alongside that eyesore <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3288.882s">and</a> public safety concern in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3290.624s">So</a> I just wanted to give an update on that property, Mr. President, and hopefully we can move forward.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w/2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w.html">Medford City Council - April 7, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=636.558s">Additionally,</a> Mr. President, this council has been on record on several occasions requesting that <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=643.062s">Republic</a> be able to turn off the machines when they're not supposed to be in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=649.206s">And</a> I know just recently we voted unanimously to have that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=652.749s">The</a> hours of operation now are 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=656.472s">to</a> 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=658.353s">And</a> these machines are accepting money prior to 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=661.755s">and</a> after 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=663.597s">We</a> met tonight for a community block grant public service proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=669.148s">And</a> one of the human service agencies, the Consumer Advisory Commission, came before us for additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=677.329s">And</a> I mentioned to the director of the program that this issue with the kiosk has been a long, ongoing issue and something that they should review. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=688.411s">And</a> I ask that this council go on record and send a letter to the Consumer Advisory Commission asking if they can intervene on behalf of every Medford resident <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=699.368s">to</a> make sure these machines are not capable of accepting money before or after the hours of operation, and also that it's publicly posted throughout the community what the exact hours of operation are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=711.958s">It's</a> very misrepresenting for residents that are trying to do business in the square to try to figure out whether or not they have to pay the kiosk, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=722.506s">And</a> I would ask that in the form of a motion tonight, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2865.494s">I'll</a> be brief, Mr. President, but I think the last piece of the puzzle would be this acoustical engineering study. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2872.417s">It'll</a> take a snapshot of what's happening in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2875.399s">If</a> we can pinpoint, it might be something internal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2877.56s">Who</a> knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2878.46s">Maybe</a> it's something within your own home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2880.181s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2880.801s">But</a> we'll find out from this study. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2883.083s">I</a> think it'll be worth its weight in gold, President, to have it done and move forward on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2888.845s">I</a> know you have a lot on your plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2890.706s">And</a> although you want to address these issues, I'm sure you want to get this behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2895.042s">I</a> look forward to seeing this done within the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2898.223s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2898.843s">Councilor,</a> Vice President Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5118.533s">The</a> chair, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5121.153s">Mr.</a> President, I'm amendable to this compromise and I just wanna make sure that the six month review is still in place.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5130.938s">I</a> just want to make sure that it's still part of the paper.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5264.795s">Would</a> you mind coming up and Judy? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5267.456s">I'm</a> sorry, Judy, Judith Beatrice. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5272.58s">Hi</a> Judy.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5357.505s">Mr.</a> Mr. President, Councilor Marks, we approving which one to just up to this bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5363.529s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5413.941s">Mr.</a> President, if I could, I know, uh, Mr. Tarami would like to appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5420.406s">So</a> I would ask that this be tabled until Mr. Tarami could make it up to our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5424.669s">Uh,</a> we, we did, uh, at some point have a rule of this council that, uh, the vetting process include, uh, that, uh, members of these boards appear before the Medford city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5436.872s">We</a> didn't make any stipulation, whether it was a reappointment or not, that they appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5442.196s">And</a> I would ask that we stick to the rules that were adopted several years ago for the vetting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5449.182s">And</a> even if it's just allowing someone to come up and say a few words, as was just done, Mr. President, I think that suits not only this council, but members of this community as well.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5485.713s">Mr.</a> President, council max, just if I could, you know, I find it troubling, Mr. President, that, uh, you know, certain members of this council speak of, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5496.077s">uh,</a> any appointments that this council has to have a vetting process in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5500.981s">Uh,</a> and then when we, uh, go to move towards a vetting process, uh, Councilors want to waive that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5508.147s">Um,</a> you know, so I, I just find it troubling and it, no one's against Mr. Trami. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5513.331s">I</a> know him very well, uh, Mr. President, and I've known him for a lot of years and I know he's a very capable person, but once we establish a process, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5522.265s">We</a> should stick by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5523.925s">And</a> the reason why we established that process years ago is because there were people just being reappointed without the council actually even ever knowing who these people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5535.948s">And</a> secondly, knowing if the job is being done on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5543.11s">And</a> I think that's why it was established at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5546.071s">We</a> had one of our own, Councilor Penta, when his reappointment came to <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5552.165s">the</a> Brooks Estates, it was questioned by a member of this council whether or not someone we serve with should be put back on the board and where the vetting process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5563.97s">And</a> now we want to just allow people to come through without the process in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5568.531s">So</a> I'm a little taken back by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5570.832s">And</a> I would hope that when we speak as a council, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5575.79s">We</a> mean what we say, Mr. President, and not just do lip service.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6741.669s">I</a> don't think anyone behind this reel wants to see anyone lose jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6745.731s">So,</a> I don't think there's one person behind this reel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6749.772s">The</a> question I do have, Mr. President, is I agree with the comments that were made that, at the very least, we're hearing one side of the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6758.015s">It</a> would be helpful to make an educated and informed decision to also hear from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6765.273s">of</a> Tufts University to hear what their reorganizational chart and plan calls for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6771.016s">I,</a> as one member, think that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6773.237s">I</a> would also ask what exactly is the resolution we're voting on? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6778.48s">The</a> language itself, is it exactly how it reads? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6784.643s">So</a> we're voting on that exact language, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6787.845s">And</a> Mr. President, I would also state that, you know, we're talking about staffing levels <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6794.169s">Tufts</a> University has every right to take a look at their staffing levels and make determinations whether they believe they have too much staff, not enough staff, whatever needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6804.156s">And</a> I would say the same applies to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6807.638s">If</a> you look at our staffing level in our police department, we're at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6812.301s">If</a> you look at the fire department, we're at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6815.623s">The</a> DPW, we're at an all-time low right now in staffing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6819.946s">So</a> I think when we talk about staffing levels, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6823.822s">and</a> want to put... <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6826.693s">the</a> onus on a particular private entity and say, we think you should leave your staffing levels at this, then I think we also have to look in-house and say, why are our staffing levels so very low? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6840.641s">Why</a> are we outsourcing work that could be done by our DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6846.264s">Why</a> are we outsourcing parking enforcement that could be done by our police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6852.088s">Why</a> are we outsourcing? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6853.929s">And</a> I would like to have that discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6856.813s">sometime,</a> too, Mr. President, because it's nice to look outside of what's happening in your own community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6862.995s">But</a> if you take a look in your community and see what's going on with low staffing levels, outsourcing, I think, you know, that, in my opinion, deserves a much better look than currently is being discussed at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6879.38s">And</a> I am <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6881.064s">supportive,</a> I will vote to support the workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6885.045s">However,</a> I think we do need, Mr. President, Barbara Rubell or someone from Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6890.927s">Barbara</a> comes up here quite often and is very familiar with this council, to at least give us something, whether she wants to appear before us or in writing, what their organizational plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6902.811s">I,</a> as one member, would find that very helpful, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6906.803s">And</a> I would look forward to future meetings with the same vigor on our own staffing levels and maybe to hold the mayor accountable, maybe members of this council that support the mayor step by step by step to also hold the mayor accountable for our low levels of manning and police, fire, and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6928.192s">And</a> not look at an institution and say, why are you doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6931.453s">Look</a> at the mayor and say, Mr. Mayor, why are you doing this to our community, Mr. Mayor, leaving us <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6936.357s">at</a> dangerously low levels of fire and police protection in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6940.719s">So,</a> I would like to see a little emphasis on that also, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7033.272s">We</a> could just add a B paper that we get a response back from either Barbara Bell or the Tufts administration on, uh, their organizational plan and also get some feedback from Tufts university itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7047.459s">I</a> have nothing in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7048.897s">other</a> than the great comment that was made by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7053.038s">But</a> I have nothing in front of me from Tufts University explaining what their reorganizational plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7058.799s">And</a> does it stop with the janitorials? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7061.8s">Or</a> does it add to police, fire, and anything else that's on the campus? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7067.521s">I</a> don't know what the impact is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7069.081s">This</a> may be just one portion of an overall larger organizational picture that I'm not privy to.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7111.873s">I</a> think where Barbara is the community relations person, I think she should be CC. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7117.096s">We'll</a> copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7117.837s">She's</a> been the only face of Tufts university with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7121.559s">She</a> is for many years on that motion.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8947.852s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8948.853s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Camuso for bringing up this very important public safety pedestrian issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8955.418s">I</a> would also ask that we amend this to include other parts of the city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8961.782s">This</a> is an issue throughout the community, the lack of signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8967.026s">And</a> the issue that Councilor Caraviello was just mentioning is thermoplastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8972.57s">And</a> anyone that's been on the council for a number of years will remember <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8976.123s">that</a> it was about six years ago that we painted about 30 crosswalks with thermoplastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8983.187s">And</a> Councilor Caraviello is 100% right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8985.228s">It's</a> slip resistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8986.748s">It's</a> highly reflective. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8988.409s">It</a> lasts up to five years, so we don't have to worry about repainting them every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8993.812s">And</a> I thought it was a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8996.514s">and</a> that that pilot program of 30 crosswalks was gonna continue, and shortly after that, the city administration discontinued using thermoplastic crosswalks, or thermoplastic, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9010.021s">The</a> state uses it on all state highways, so that must tell you that it's long-lasting and it's highly reflective. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9017.866s">But</a> in this city, we opt to <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9021.596s">put</a> forth 50 resolutions a year to ask that our crosswalks be painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9028.659s">And</a> it's no reflection on DPW, which is understaffed, as I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9034.642s">However,</a> you know, we have far too many crosswalks in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9039.905s">And</a> I think you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9041.225s">Maybe</a> it is time that we look at bringing in a private company to assist in the painting of crosswalks <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9051.102s">And</a> thermoplastic would be a preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9056.166s">However,</a> I'm not sure if this administration really, to be quite frank, cares about the condition of crosswalks or pedestrian safety, for that fact, in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9070.057s">There's</a> been no traffic calming. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9072.929s">approaches</a> done by this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9076.15s">The</a> last thing we did was the raised crosswalk on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9080.751s">We</a> were promised two additional crosswalks, one on Central Ave and one on Harvard, that are yet to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9088.214s">But</a> those are really the only traffic calming approaches that I can think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9095.291s">And</a> we don't have to recreate the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9097.812s">All</a> you need to do is look at Cambridge, and they have under their pedestrian DPW section of their website a whole traffic calming section about widening sidewalks, about raised crosswalks, about a host of issues on how to create pedestrian safety in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9119.26s">But</a> for some reason, we just keep on <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9122.64s">doing</a> the same thing over and over again, and the administration appears to be content with that, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9129.366s">So</a> I agree with Councilor Camuso's recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9132.848s">I</a> would just add, if we can add, if Councilor Camuso doesn't mind, crosswalk signs in all parts of the community, because they are needed, and that thermoplastic be looked at on any painting done in this community from here on, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9148.761s">It</a> may be a little more expensive, but in the long run, it's cost-effective.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9722.184s">I</a> just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Penta, as was mentioned, he's been persistent on this issue for a number of years and I'm not sure why nothing has happened to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9735.751s">But</a> you know, just, I think it was a month ago, a month and a half ago, this council requested that we take down the holiday candles that are still in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9748.373s">And</a> now I'm actually seeing why the mayor's leaving him up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9751.675s">Because</a> I think his overall master plan is, if the lights go out, he's going to turn the candles on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9757.378s">And</a> maybe that's his way of lighting up the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9760.8s">So</a> he may have a bigger project on his hands here, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9768.204s">And</a> we asked for the lenses to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9776.369s">They</a> replaced the lenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9778.303s">The</a> lighting in the square, in my opinion, is still dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9780.563s">I</a> know there's a number of lights out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9782.284s">It's</a> still dark in the square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9786.205s">You</a> know, it's not inviting after dark to go into the square because, you know, let's face it, people want to go and feel safe in a well-lit area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9795.167s">And</a> Medford Square is not well-lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9798.407s">You</a> just get a feeling like it's deserted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9801.588s">You</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9802.188s">And</a> it's a shame that you have businesses down there that have to put up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9806.756s">You</a> know, not only did the mayor implement the parking kiosk to get your money, he's making it so you go down there and you need a flashlight to walk around with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9815.079s">I</a> mean, it's really getting to a point, and Councilor Penta's right, you know, maybe the mayor should come out of his office or his house and walk around the city and traverse and see the potholes and see the sidewalks that are crumbling and see the lights that are out and go into the restroom across from his office <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9835.381s">and</a> see the yellow caution tape around the urinal, and come here at City Hall and see the holes in the ceiling, and then go to the Medford Public Library, which is in Dianita work, and then go to the fire department and the police department that needs work, and maybe he'll see what's going on in this community and get his head out of the sand and move forward on some of these issues, Madam President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10452.445s">Yes,</a> Madam President, I received several emails just recently and over the last several weeks regarding resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10460.688s">There's</a> still an issue with residents that have a permit parking sticker receiving tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10468.171s">And</a> it was brought up over in West Medford on Bauer in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10472.313s">And</a> I received another email, actually two emails just recently about residents that are receiving tickets with permit parking stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10481.066s">I'm</a> not sure what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10482.387s">Several</a> weeks ago, we asked them to look into the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10485.468s">We</a> were told that there was a glitch with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10489.469s">And</a> for some reason, they were unable for a period of time to identify who had permit stickers and who didn't have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10496.252s">And</a> that was supposedly resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10498.053s">And</a> now I'm getting more emails today with residents that are still getting tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10502.854s">And</a> they're being told that they have to go up to the Republic office, which is a giant inconvenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10510.373s">with</a> something that, by no fault of their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10513.955s">So,</a> you know, I can't wait for this meeting, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10516.737s">I</a> can't wait to get the finances on this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10519.458s">I</a> can't wait to find out some of the questions that we've asked regarding this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10526.602s">And,</a> you know, it may come to some point, and I'm starting to agree with Councilor Penter on this, that we may be looking, I think, to maybe take in-house some aspects of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10538.842s">And</a> in my opinion, the enforcement would be number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10541.884s">Take</a> that in, get our own in-house people to start the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10545.165s">We</a> can use their equipment and, you know, we can keep a lot of the program in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10551.188s">But</a> I think many of the issues that I'm hearing comes with enforcement, the aggressive enforcement in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10558.592s">We</a> were sold a bill of goods that, oh, they're not going to be aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10562.113s">They're</a> not going to be like Somerville hiding behind bushes and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10566.015s">You</a> know, there's going to be a grace period. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10568.11s">And</a> now we heard Councilor Caraviello last week saying the guy was standing behind his car when he had three or four minutes left on the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10575.015s">He</a> came out of the store and the guy had his handheld device there waiting to give him a ticket with his plate already written in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10583.261s">So</a> we went from, oh no, they're not going to be aggressive to standing behind someone's car waiting for the minutes to tick off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10589.443s">So</a> the residents can be the judge of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10592.984s">And</a> no matter what the mayor sold as a bill of goods, ultimately what happens is they're driven by money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10600.126s">This</a> outside private company is driven by money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10603.546s">And</a> naturally, they're going to be aggressive to try to bring in money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10606.547s">And</a> that's going to be at the detriment of the business owners and also the residents of this community.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw/2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw.html">Medford City Council - March 24, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1309.566s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I have no problem supporting this paper here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1314.308s">I</a> did receive several calls from concerned residents of Bradbury Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1320.03s">There</a> appears to be an electrical wire that's hanging from 64 Bradbury, about 12 feet from the sidewalk, and extends down Bradbury to the corner of 3rd Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1332.976s">And</a> I know neighbors have made several calls to <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1339.011s">The</a> electrical company and have not received any feedback at all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1344.834s">So</a> if we can make that as part of the committee report, it's 64 Bradbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1350.778s">It</a> goes down Bradbury to the corner of Bradbury and 3rd St. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1355.941s">And</a> it appears to be hanging from one of your glass insulators at the top.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1370.288s">If</a> you could take a look at that immediately, because residents are concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1374.091s">I</a> would motion for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1658.68s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1661.282s">You</a> know, I like the concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1663.223s">The</a> one concern I have is the fact that that Wendy's closes at 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1670.466s">So</a> you can't go in and order after 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1673.308s">You</a> can use the drive-thru, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1676.07s">And</a> after that time... Now till 3 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1679.112s">Well,</a> after that time, even though that particular section, as the gentleman just alluded to, won't be lit, it will be lit from Middlesex Ave, with the lighting that's currently on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1691.061s">And</a> my concern is that at 1, 2, 3 in the morning, if people want to get out on a nice summer night, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1699.434s">That</a> could turn into an area that people sit down and eat and so forth, which would pose a real concern for the area and also area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1713.905s">So</a> I have a little concern, Mr. President, unless they're going to take the furniture in after dark every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1720.89s">Is</a> that gated off?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1740.254s">I</a> just don't want it to turn into a hangout.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1744.136s">After</a> hours, especially where it's not going to be lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1747.719s">And</a> I can see that particular area at 12, 1, 2 in the morning becoming a hangout. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1754.343s">And</a> I have real concerns, Mr. President, with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1757.407s">So</a> unless the furniture is going to be removed every night at dusk, I couldn't support that, Mr. President, in its current form.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1791.189s">I</a> may be amendable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1793.03s">The</a> gate, the fence itself only looks maybe three feet high. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1797.152s">It</a> doesn't look like much of a fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1800.233s">But,</a> you know, noise travels, especially on a warm summer night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1804.535s">And</a> there are residents, you may not think so, there are residents in that close proximity that I would hate to have concerns down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1815.095s">of</a> people calling up saying they can hear, you know, people out at 2 in the morning, 3 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1820.178s">I</a> just have a real concern with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1822.3s">And</a> I'm not sure if that's the direction we should be going in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1828.864s">We</a> allowed the 3 o'clock extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1832.826s">Maybe</a> if we put a 6-month review on this, I would be amenable maybe to a 6-month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1840.752s">But</a> somehow that furniture has to be removed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1845.3s">Because</a> I'm not sure what a gate would do, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1848.863s">And</a> I'm not sure if their employees are going to want to go out and start kicking people off the property.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1872.568s">Well,</a> our police have better things to do than kick people out of your property with all due respect.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1910.824s">The</a> furniture is not my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1911.924s">My</a> concern is the fact that there'll be people loitering out there after hours and that that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1919.39s">You</a> know, maybe if Wendy's wanted to open their restaurant and allow people that maybe one o'clock in the morning we're going to sit down inside your establishment and have something to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1930.285s">Maybe</a> that may be what could be done.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2425.513s">Mr.</a> President, I don't mind the six-month review, but I don't see what the hardship is to take in, you said there's seating for 12, take in 12 chairs and three tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2436.481s">You</a> know, outdoor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2445.068s">They</a> may have to rearrange what they were going to order, Mr. President, based on our approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2450.656s">I</a> realize that's what they're calling for, but, um, you know, we have a program that allows businesses to put tables and chairs out in the sidewalk, Mr. President, and we don't allow them to leave the tables and chairs at the end of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2464.521s">Those</a> tables and chairs have to be taken in and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2467.483s">And</a> I don't see any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2468.943s">I,</a> you know, I don't mind the six month review, but, um, I don't see why Wendy's can't take in this furniture every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2476.566s">If</a> this is something you want to offer seasonal for three months, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2479.562s">This</a> is something that you're going to have to take in the furniture, or you're not going to get my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2483.785s">I</a> don't know where anyone else stands, but I just, you know, speaking on behalf of the residents in that area, and there are many, I couldn't possibly support something that may attract people at three in the morning to sit out there and not only have a burger, but maybe a couple of beers, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2500.295s">Don't</a> forget, so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2741.922s">After</a> it gets dark, according to... At dusk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2920.506s">You</a> know, why would we want to invite residents at 10 o'clock to an area that's not going to be lit? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2929.171s">And</a> forget about Wendy's, because they're not looking out for residents of this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2933.84s">Why</a> would we want, if the gentleman said it's not going to be lit, and we're going to allow people, our residents, to go and use this area that's not lit, to me would pose a great danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2945.066s">I'm</a> not sure why we would allow that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2949.349s">It</a> doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2951.51s">It</a> may work for the store to have it open until 11, but if it's not lit, then why are we, you know,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2981.847s">It</a> doesn't light up your area, you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2983.748s">It</a> doesn't light up the area.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2987.049s">It's</a> gonna be close enough to give enough light. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2989.609s">So</a> originally then you were allowing lights out there without any restrictions at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2995.651s">You</a> just wanted to have a little potty area out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2998.712s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2999.552s">You</a> made it sound originally like once it turns dark, there's no one's gonna go by there because <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3005.5s">Once</a> the sun goes down, you're not going to go out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3007.821s">Now</a> you're saying, well, there's enough lighting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3009.702s">You</a> could stay until 10, 11 o'clock, if need be.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3017.884s">Yeah,</a> but that's not how it was presented to us originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3020.845s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3021.666s">You</a> made it sound like there was no lighting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3025.687s">And</a> now all of a sudden there's lighting because you want it to be open until 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3029.809s">Mr.</a> President, I can't support 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3032.37s">I</a> can't support 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3033.993s">That's</a> not the purpose of those lights out there to light up that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3039.357s">And</a> to me, you know, when you're trying to put a baby to bed at 8 o'clock is late to hear noise of someone that may be out there 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3049.846s">You</a> know, so I can't support that if we want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3056.971s">Dusk</a> hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3058.372s">Or</a> even 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, but not 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3061.553s">I</a> think that's far too late, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3073.655s">What</a> hour, 11 o'clock?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3078.596s">I</a> would ask that that be amended to <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3081.288s">8</a> o'clock, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3081.989s">I</a> withdraw the 11 and amendable to 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3086.031s">It's</a> a six-month review, so we can revisit this in a six-month period.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3099.499s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3659.866s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4231.465s">The</a> parking that currently exists, will that still exist in front of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4236.568s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4236.848s">So</a> we're not replacing any handicapped spots or anything else that's in front of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4242.411s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4243.031s">No</a> changes are proposed or required to the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4247.214s">So</a> the width of this patio that you're talking, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4251.417s">It</a> appears to be at least, what, 11, 12 feet?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4282.052s">Okay,</a> and are you going to focus people that don't want to use the outside area to a particular entrance?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4301.824s">But</a> currently you have two accesses now to get into your main entrance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4305.506s">Right,</a> that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4306.626s">So</a> are we doing away with one of the accesses and you're only going to have <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4310.624s">So</a> you are going to have multiple accesses then?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9756.974s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9758.155s">I</a> share many of the comments by my colleagues that were mentioned behind the reel tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9766.131s">And,</a> you know, from day one, when the mayor made his proposal, members of this council spoke up and said, Mr. Mayor, when you outsource the enforcement, you're taking all local control out of the hands of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9784.496s">And</a> we're seeing that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9786.277s">How</a> can you tell a company that has a 10-year contract <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9790.052s">that</a> their revenue is based on whatever ticketing they go out and do, to say, hey, you know what, be a little lax, be a little understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9798.578s">It's</a> never gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9801.139s">That</a> is their revenue stream. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9803.141s">You're</a> not gonna get that company to say, you know what, we will be sensitive, we will, you know, if someone's in church, or someone just got out of mass, or someone ran into the store for a second, or someone's in a loading zone, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9817.71s">and</a> they're just delivering something into their store. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9819.971s">You're</a> not going to get that type of sensitive nature from this enforcement company. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9829.474s">That's</a> what they are, they're an enforcement company. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9832.554s">And</a> my suggestion, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater at this point, because a lot of time and effort went into this, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9842.121s">My</a> suggestion would be, any parking enforcement program consists of three major components. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9849.324s">It's</a> maintenance, collections, and enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9853.266s">I</a> believe, as I believed from the start, that we can do the enforcement in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9858.48s">We</a> can control how aggressive we want in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9862.244s">We</a> can hire the employees in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9865.167s">And</a> if we were to take that component out, leave the other components, the collection, the maintenance to Republic right now, take that one component of just enforcement away from the picture, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9879.537s">Will</a> that still cost the city $900,000 to opt out a portion of the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9885.441s">I</a> doubt it very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9887.062s">And</a> maybe that's what we should be exploring. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9889.524s">Because</a> as I stated from the start, I as one member of the council, and I think many members feel the same behind this reeling, is that once you lose the local control of enforcement, all bets are off. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9901.592s">And</a> that's what we're seeing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9902.872s">We're</a> seeing very aggressive enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9905.77s">Så</a> my suggestion would be that we asked if Councilor Penta would be amendable to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9913.234s">We</a> asked the mayor to find out what it would take for us to take on the enforcement of this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9922.498s">What</a> is the dollar amount so we can opt out of the enforcement and we'll leave everything else in place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9928.541s">So</a> the city would be responsible for hearings and enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9932.853s">If</a> you want to outsource the hearings, that's something you can look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9936.455s">But</a> those would be the two items that the city is responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9940.017s">And</a> as Councilor Knight mentioned, other than the Traffic Commission, they're the ones that really set the policy around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9948.521s">So</a> I think if we take that back in-house, the enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9951.92s">I</a> think we'll go a long way to make sure that we're the city that we wanted to be in the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9957.402s">We</a> don't want to be an aggressive ticketing city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9960.664s">That's</a> not what the city of methods all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9963.105s">We</a> want to make sure cars are moved along. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9965.626s">And</a> that's been the, uh, the emphasis on this from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9969.047s">So,</a> um, I, I would offer, uh, ask my colleague respectfully, and I think Councilor Penta brings up a lot of valid concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9977.547s">But</a> I think that may be a good option to put forward, something that I believe will strike at a lot of the concerns that I'm hearing from residents about the aggressive enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9993.212s">If</a> I knew there was a way around it, there's no way you're gonna tell a for-profit company, you know what, go a little lax on the ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10003.095s">That's</a> their revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10004.556s">What</a> business is going to say, you know what, Meffin, you're right, we'll go a little lax. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10008.838s">You</a> know, we won't hit those, we won't hit the residents or the out-of-towners as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10013.92s">We'll</a> go easy on the ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10015.661s">It's</a> just never going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10017.902s">So</a> I would ask my council colleague, Councilor Penter, if he would be amenable to sending that to the mayor to see if we could take that in-house at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10026.486s">I</a> also noticed in the correspondence we received back from <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10031.603s">regarding</a> paper 15-081 and 15-022 dated March 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10041.11s">We</a> mentioned to the mayor and the parking traffic commission that without permit parking stickers, residents are no longer able to call and say there's someone parked on our street that doesn't belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10055.6s">And</a> we got a response to the paper from the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10059.552s">saying</a> we are investigating a permit sticker to be placed on all residential permit parking vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10066.584s">Wow,</a> that sounds familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10067.706s">That's</a> what we've done for the last 10 years in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10071.74s">You</a> know, it was this new parking program that said, you know what, we're going to do away with the stickers without any input from anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10079.184s">And</a> they're finding out, you know what, that doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10082.426s">That</a> doesn't work because a lot of what's the resident permit issues are called on by residents that call calling up and you're tying the residents hand by not having stickers on vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10095.533s">So,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10098.22s">I</a> think, you know, we're at a point where we are at right now, from no enforcement at all, nothing happened in the community, to at least a program, it has a lot of faults, but I think we could stick with a portion of the program and not can the whole program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10114.209s">And</a> in my opinion, the enforcement is the big issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10118.531s">Let's</a> take that in-house, let's hire our own traffic crossing guards, our own retired police, let's put them on the payroll for 20 hours a week, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10127.177s">Let's</a> get some enforcement out there that we can control and say, you know what, we don't want it to happen like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10133.96s">That</a> would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=10135.361s">I</a> want to ask my council colleague, Councilor Penta, if he'd be willing to go that direction before we throw the whole program out.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11562.411s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11563.872s">I'll</a> be brief because of the late hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11566.908s">As</a> we all read in the local paper and received a correspondence from the mayor, the city of Medford is in line to receive $143,000 of state aid to help with the filling of potholes and repair of streets throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11583.037s">I</a> would only ask that the raised crosswalk on Winthrop Street, which if you come up or down Winthrop Street, you'll realize that other than the <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11594.077s">yellow</a> neon signs on both sides of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11596.98s">The</a> raised crosswalk itself blends into the road and is very difficult to see when you're coming up on it, especially if you're at some speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11606.809s">And</a> I would ask that the white markings, which were originally on the raised crosswalk, be replaced back in the interest of public safety with just a portion of the $143,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11619.318s">towards</a> the repair of streets and potholes.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA/2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA.html">Medford City Council - March 17, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=516.727s">Councilor</a> Knight, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=519.089s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I would like to thank Councilor Camuso for his continued efforts on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=527.376s">I</a> think it would be helpful, as Councilor Knight just mentioned, about knowing the revenue stream, and maybe we should do our own homework to find out what exactly, and I don't know if you've already found out, but what a position of this would cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=541.518s">I</a> think that'd be helpful in making a decision, at least going forward and asking the mayor to look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=548.02s">And</a> also, I know there are a number of initiatives currently taking place within our community that's on a tri-city level, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=557.112s">that</a> deals with sting operations when people are serving underage, you know, people in the community in different establishments, kids buying cigarettes that are underage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=572.159s">And</a> that operation has been a tri-city with Method, Everett, and Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=578.582s">And</a> maybe we can look at combining efforts when it comes to this substance abuse coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=585.902s">and</a> see what other surrounding communities are doing, and it might be worthwhile to take a program and create something that currently exists on a different level, but maybe expand it to the other communities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=597.947s">So</a> I would just offer that as a suggestion, but this is definitely a worthwhile initiative and something that's, at least from my initial discussions in the community, is warranted at this point.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1505.995s">Thank</a> you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1507.135s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1508.676s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1510.697s">Just</a> as everyone was talking, you know, it's great that I think we want the mayor to <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1515.402s">implement</a> something, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1518.023s">But</a> we as a council could implement our own program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1522.663s">And</a> I think it would be a great idea to have youngsters of this community take part in local government by inviting them up to the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1532.445s">You</a> can mentor your own student, invite them behind the reeling, let them listen to debate, let them add dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1540.107s">And</a> this could be a great way of involving kids throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1545.135s">And</a> it's something that we have direct control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1547.876s">And</a> it doesn't have to be limited to youngsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1550.577s">We</a> can invite business owners behind the railing to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1553.778s">Every</a> councilor can invite someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1555.258s">And</a> I think it's a great way of opening up government, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1560.52s">And</a> you're right, the school committee, back some years ago, we used to invite people behind the railing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1566.262s">And</a> you would be a sponsor for someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1569.26s">and</a> that person would be able to ask questions of the chair, other members, and it was a real informative way of involving the community, getting input, and as we always hear, even from Jean who speaks at the podium and other people that come before the podium, that you look out in the audience and you might see at any given time four or five people in a city of 58,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1592.552s">What</a> better way? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1593.332s">So</a> I would ask that as a council, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1597.488s">And</a> in particular, you, Mr. President, that we allow maybe one meeting a month to be a sponsor, invite people behind the railing, one person per council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1608.872s">You</a> don't have to invite someone if you don't like and open the meeting up to allow someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1615.054s">And</a> I realize they're not elected and their vote is not going to carry weight as a vote on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1621.677s">But</a> I think it would be a great experience for many youngsters in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1626.252s">And</a> open that up, like I said, to business owners, to seniors, whoever we want to invite, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1632.257s">And</a> I think it's a win-win situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1634.879s">So,</a> I would look to your leadership, Mr. President, in putting something to that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1641.944s">And</a> it's something we can do and not rely on the mayor to act upon, because the mayor may never get around. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1647.369s">Although</a> I think this is a worthy program, Councilor Camuso, he may never get around to offering a mentoring program in the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2914.063s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2915.184s">And</a> this dialogue is extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2919.547s">So</a> what I would say is with the last contract that the mayor signed with Comcast, that contract called for yearly increases to every ratepayer of this community with no relief in sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2935.857s">I</a> haven't spoken to one person in this community that said that their cable rates are going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2942.561s">So</a> there's been steady increases in cable rates over the last ten years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2949.352s">Why</a> would you want to give out another 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2952.553s">Wouldn't</a> it be more prudent to have both Verizon and Comcast on a short leash, having them worry about whether or not the city's going to renew the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2965.659s">And</a> that way, in my opinion, they'll be more competitive with the rates, and they'll be more willing not to raise rates because they know the contract's going to be up in two or three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2979.1s">This</a> 10-year contract does nothing for the ratepayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2983.381s">It</a> may be easy for the mayor to sign a 10-year contract and take that off his plate so he doesn't have to revisit that for another 10 years, but it does nothing for you or I as a ratepayer, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2995.363s">It</a> does nothing to lower rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2997.203s">It</a> does nothing to improve programming, as we've seen with local access for the last three and a half years in this community, and in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3007.884s">It</a> would suit every ratepayer in this community if they were part of the negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3015.292s">And</a> I realize the mayor is the sole negotiating authority, but why not put together, as Councilor Knight mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3021.58s">member</a> of the council, maybe a member of the business community, you know, a senior member of the community, someone, you know, a family member, someone that has a family in the community, a host of different people in the community to sit on this committee and negotiate it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3038.512s">You</a> know, it just, to me, you know, it's the quick fix to getting a contract out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3046.398s">And</a> as I mentioned, rates have not gone down. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3049.4s">So</a> my past experience in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3051.654s">is</a> that rates go up every year, unchecked. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3055.297s">And</a> the thought is, well, if you don't want to go with us, go with Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3061.801s">And</a> you go to Verizon, their rates are no better than Comcast, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3066.045s">They're</a> in cahoots with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3068.166s">So</a> the service may differ a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3070.708s">But</a> when it truly comes to the leverage we have as a community, it's bargaining the contract and standing up for the residents of this community <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3080.774s">and</a> stating right within the contract, for the first four years, we do not want a rate crease, no rate crease at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3089.181s">That</a> would be part of a contract that I was signed, Mr. President, if I was in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3094.485s">That</a> would be on behalf of the beleaguered taxpayer and ratepayer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3099.427s">And</a> to leave it open-ended and give a 10-year contract, you just might as well give them a blank check, because that's what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3106.052s">The</a> minute that's signed, the rates are going to continue to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3109.354s">All</a> of a sudden, the programming they were offering, that's how they squeeze you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3113.117s">They</a> give you a certain tier you're in, and all of a sudden, the four major channels that you used to watch in that tier are no longer part of that tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3122.203s">You've</a> got to move up to the next tier, which is another $39.50 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3126.6s">And</a> they squeeze you and continually squeeze you in that manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3130.361s">And,</a> you know, I would hope that the mayor doesn't consider doing this alone, the contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3138.024s">And</a> I would hope that he looks for a much shorter contract so we can keep this company on a short leash and hold them accountable, Mr. President, for raising rates and doing away with programming and not offering local cable access. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3155.261s">because</a> they should be the ones, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3157.803s">They're</a> the ones collecting our franchise fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3160.924s">The</a> local cable access should be going to the mayor and saying, Mr. Mayor, with all due respect, we're collecting money from every rate payer in the community saying that we're going to provide access, and we haven't done that for four years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3175.212s">As</a> a business owner, I feel incumbent to raise this to you, Mr. Mayor, and say maybe we should not be collecting these franchise fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3183.492s">until</a> you get your house in order and provide local cable access. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3188.533s">So</a> there are a lot of issues with this, and I look forward to, in particular, Councilor Knight's resolution to see if we could have a seat on this as part of this negotiation, and also to include other residents of this community, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg/2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg.html">Medford City Council - March 10, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1002.831s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1003.791s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Penter and my colleagues for speaking on this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1009.169s">You</a> know, this is very similar to the crosswalks that we ask to be painted every year, basic city services that are not being done in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1021.274s">The</a> request that Councilor Longo, myself, and other members have offered with the 311 system is just a reporting mechanism that allows people by electronic device. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1033.499s">Imagine</a> that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1035.3s">Nowadays,</a> you can use an electronic device to report something. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1039.413s">You</a> don't have to pick up the phone and reach out and listen to the mayor's 10-minute message board on what department to contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1048.975s">Ironically,</a> the mayor is about three quarters of the way into the recorded message. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1055.496s">So</a> you have to listen to 20 other departments before you get to quote the mayor's office to issue a concern or request, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1065.377s">I</a> find that quite amazing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1069.282s">You</a> know, the state is already out filling potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1071.663s">I've</a> seen it on the Fells Way in the Wellington area, and we should be no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1077.706s">I</a> realize that this is not the ideal time to fill potholes, but it's imperative that we get out there right now and fill these holes, have a tracking mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1090.093s">I</a> agree with Councilor Penta, whether it's sending an email or using your iPhone, there has to be a tracking mechanism that the city can log these requests in, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1099.227s">and</a> get back to residents in a timely fashion on whether or not their problem has any type of resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1107.392s">The</a> other thing, Mr. President, is the city of Boston, as well as Somerville and Cambridge, they know how to involve the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1114.757s">What</a> better than having 58,000 sets of eyes out in the community saying, hey, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1121.261s">There's</a> a pothole on this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1122.422s">There's</a> one at the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1123.302s">There's</a> one next to the sewer on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1125.244s">There's</a> one next to the catch basin on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1128.1s">What</a> better than to have 58,000 reporters out there letting you know where the problem is? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1136.246s">I</a> would welcome that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1137.907s">I</a> think that's, you know, I know it's a daunting task, but I would welcome that type of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1143.651s">And</a> in our community, it's frowned upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1147.214s">You</a> know, they make it so difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1149.542s">to</a> report in this community that people say, you know what, forget about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1154.124s">And</a> I think what you're seeing on our streets and our roads is the years of the forget-about-its. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1160.408s">People</a> aren't calling in anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1161.788s">They</a> say it's not worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1163.449s">You</a> know, we get no response. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1164.87s">And,</a> you know, I think this is long overdue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1169.272s">The</a> 3-1-1 system, you know, I believe, as was mentioned, some of us has had this in their community, I think, for 12 or 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1179.073s">maybe</a> even longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1180.555s">There</a> was initial startup costs like any good program, but now it's worth its weight in gold. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1186.441s">The</a> number of complaints they receive and the number of calls that are adjudicated within a timely fashion speaks volumes to how city government should operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1197.453s">And</a> it shouldn't be the <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1200.275s">constant</a> phone calls, because even during the storm, and I brought this up, Mr. President, residents would call me and say, I don't want to call you in particular, I just want to know how do I get a hold of someone? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1211.259s">It</a> may be 5 o'clock on a Saturday evening or Sunday morning, but I still need to get someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1216.461s">And</a> that was the tough task of trying to put them in touch with someone that can assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1222.041s">And</a> I think these are the things that the mayor needs to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1227.063s">We've</a> asked the mayor about having on the phone some type of mechanism where you can leave a phone call, a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1238.989s">There</a> is none of that at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1240.47s">So</a> if someone's not in their office, and many of these offices, as we know, are understaffed, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1245.89s">And</a> there may not be someone there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1248.19s">The</a> mayor rather the phone ring 7,000 times and no one pick it up than someone be able to leave a phone message to the appropriate department. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1257.112s">That's</a> how this city works for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1259.532s">I'm</a> not quite sure, Mr. President, but I wholeheartedly support this resolution, the motion that was offered by Councilor Longo a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1270.514s">And</a> I would say, Mr. President, as I've done in the last couple of weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1274.839s">These</a> are the issues that we should take to budget, and when the mayor says, hey, I need all your vote, I need all your vote for the budget, we sit down and say, yes, Mr. Mayor, you'll get that in due time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1285.344s">And</a> that time is when you start working on some of the issues that's going to help this community move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1290.786s">And</a> one of them is the 311 system, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1294.928s">I</a> feel strongly about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1296.589s">We</a> also received <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1299.29s">through</a> a request I had on the equipment that DPW has. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1302.852s">I</a> know we all know there's going to be a new yacht, and I was flabbergasted to see the equipment that we have currently right now with no plans to update, with a brand-new state-of-the-art facility coming in, and equipment that's 25, 30, 35 years old, Mr. President, in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1322.845s">You</a> know, it's nice to get value out of your property, but at some point, it becomes an old piece of rust, and it's no longer valuable, and it ends up sitting behind the DPW yard, or in back of the police department, or a lot of other locations in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1338.55s">So,</a> there needs to be a capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1342.411s">There</a> needs to be something done in this community, and I hope the mayor takes this not only under advisement, but acts upon it, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2119.685s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2120.445s">While</a> we're under suspension, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2121.83s">Um,</a> over the last several days, I received a number of phone calls and emails from, uh, particularly residents in salt method, uh, that are concerned about, uh, the resident permit parking, uh, or I should say lack of resident permit parking that's happening in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2137.415s">Uh,</a> I mentioned to many of the residents that called me that, uh, the chief of police is looking into, uh, permit parking, resident permit parking citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2148.258s">Um,</a> and, uh, he said within the next year or two, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2151.88s">They</a> will probably come out with some type of plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2154.442s">However,</a> Mr. President, we need immediate attention to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2159.044s">And</a> we not only need immediate attention, we need to look at sector parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2165.167s">Right</a> now, as we all know, when area residents on their street want permit parking, they have to get together a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2173.672s">If</a> 51 percent of the residents sign it, it goes before the Traffic Commission, and then the Traffic Commission will vote it up or down. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2180.608s">whether</a> that street will have permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2183.629s">And</a> it's only good for that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2186.049s">So</a> if I happen to live on Yield Street and want to park on the next street over that are both permit parking streets, I can only park on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2196.391s">And</a> as we all know, the issue, particularly in these snow times, is that there may be 20 spots with 50 residents that have permit parking that are looking to get spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2209.498s">To</a> me, sector parking makes sense if you wanted to break it down by precinct or by ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2215.54s">Um,</a> I've also had people mentioned, well, the reason why we started permit parking was that if I live close to, uh, just say the West Medford train center, uh, the commuter rail and people from other parts of the city or even outside the city want to use the commuter rail, uh, they can park on my street and take the commuter rail and stay there for eight hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2237.887s">And</a> if you have one permit citywide, the same will be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2242.951s">You</a> can have someone from North Method that comes down into West Method, parks there all day under his permit sticker, and takes the training. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2250.578s">So</a> I think it does make sense to have sector parking out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2254.361s">I</a> think that would eliminate a lot of the issues with people maybe from other areas parking for a particular reason in other neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2265.029s">But</a> something needs to be done immediately <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2267.672s">to</a> resolve this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2269.793s">It's</a> not getting any better. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2271.714s">The</a> parking program that the mayor put in place has a lot of faults. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2277.076s">And</a> one of them, Mr. President, is the fact that after hours, on weekends, the only way you get permit parking enforced is by calling the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2289.162s">And</a> that's the system we went away from when supposing this new parking program was coming into effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2295.975s">It</a> shouldn't be on an add need basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2299.497s">So</a> residents shouldn't need to call to get basic enforcement of resident permit parking streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2304.98s">That's</a> why you petitioned the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2307.481s">That's</a> why the enforcement should be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2309.882s">So,</a> um, you know, something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2313.144s">I</a> would ask that we take a vote on this council asking that, uh, the chief of police make this a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2319.588s">I</a> know he's busy with a lot of issues, but, uh, you know, with this parking program, there should have been more involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2326.107s">and</a> more input from the community regarding resident permit parking and how it's going to work throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2332.369s">Because</a> clearly right now, it's dysfunctional. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2335.89s">And</a> at best, it functions on occasion and by phone call into the police department or into park method, which, in my opinion, is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2349.995s">Residents</a> shouldn't be required to make phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2352.336s">So</a> I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2356.192s">that</a> the chief of police report back to this council when he will start his process for revamping permit parking in this community and also to take into consideration sector permit parking.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3098.86s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3100.08s">Uh,</a> one of the issue that I failed to mention was that, uh, prior to this new parking program, uh, residents that got resident permit parking, uh, permits would put a sticker on their windshield. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3112.288s">So</a> if you lived on a street, you'd be able to see on the street who had a resident permit parking and who was parked illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3120.18s">Now</a> they did away with the stickers, so if you need to call in and say, you know, this person's illegal on the street, there's no indication now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3130.026s">And</a> that's a huge concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3132.288s">So</a> on the weekends and at nights, if your street's packed with cars, you're not gonna be able to look for a sticker anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3138.892s">You'd</a> have to know because the cars go by that do the vehicle identification reading by the plates, and they can tell if you have a sticker or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3146.417s">So</a> it really wipes away <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3148.635s">any</a> of that activity from residents that can call in and say, Hey, these particular cars are parked illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3155.319s">And</a> that's an issue that wasn't well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3157.38s">Uh,</a> I know the intention was all, uh, uh, well-purposed, uh, doing away with stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3163.364s">But</a> now, you know, if, if the enforcement's not out there and residents want to call, what do they call on? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3169.227s">There's</a> no indication anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3171.809s">And</a> that's another thing that, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3173.749s">When</a> the chief gets together, and I have every faith and confidence in the chief, and I know the chief will involve the community, he'll involve the business districts, he'll involve everyone and come to a consensus, unlike some other people in this community that came to the consensus dealing with their three or four department heads and had no involvement at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3199.828s">I</a> know whatever the Chief does, it'll be well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3203.15s">I</a> would just ask that this take place quicker than later, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3760.827s">Just</a> if I could, while the gentleman was up there before he leaves, you referred to every block. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3766.769s">That's</a> also a tool where residents can communicate with
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3803.253s">Mr.</a> President, maybe we should get a representative from Comcast to come and inform this council on what EveryBlock does and how it would impact the lives of residents of this community.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1324.653s">Thank</a> you, if that's all, Councilor Matz? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1327.355s">Yes,</a> John, is the red, is that accessible by public safety vehicles?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1352.498s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1353.318s">And</a> the, uh, the original charter, uh, where, where was the original location for this club?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1397.926s">Okay,</a> the reason why I ask, and I'm not sure if Councilor Penta was referring to that, is next to the old water and sewer building, the Italian American Club was there, as you probably are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1411.547s">for</a> many years until it burned down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1414.148s">And,</a> um, many of the organization members were trying to relocate back in the city here because their original charter was a method charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1424.31s">And,</a> um, I'm not sure if this organization, uh, if you have any affiliations with anyone from the Italian American club, but, um, I know there was a great interest to come back into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1438.054s">So</a> I don't know if maybe at some point, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1440.633s">There</a> could be some discussions.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3524.662s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3527.384s">And,</a> um, you know, those, those statements were very powerful that were, uh, mentioned here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3535.287s">And</a> as I'm aware and many people are aware, the first step to recovery is to admit that there's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3544.332s">That's</a> the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3546.193s">And</a> I don't think that this community, and when I say the community, the residents, the elected officials, the public safety officials, have taken the first step yet to admitting there's a problem in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3560.36s">And</a> I, as a member of the council, would like to see us as a council tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3565.877s">send</a> out a message as a council stating that we believe that there's a major concern with drugs in our community, and there's many addictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3577.943s">We</a> heard some stories here tonight, and I thank my colleagues for sharing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3581.304s">I</a> shared a story that I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3582.685s">My</a> father was addicted to gambling and tore our family apart when I was a youngster with four kids in the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3589.808s">And,</a> you know, it's a different addiction, but <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3594.171s">Many</a> people experience many different types of addictions, whether it's drug, whether it's womanizing, whether it's gambling. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3602.816s">There's</a> a lot of different addictions out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3605.558s">And</a> I would like tonight for us to take a vote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3609.82s">I</a> know we voted to set up roundtable discussions, but I think we should, as a community, because as the gentleman mentioned tonight, and he really put it forward that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3623.046s">When</a> he looked at members of the council, he saw blank stares. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3626.989s">And</a> I'll be the first to say, I wasn't aware of how many people have died over the last few years from overdoses. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3634.393s">I've</a> heard about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3635.394s">I've</a> known people, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3637.996s">But</a> I wasn't aware of the epidemic that was going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3643.499s">And</a> I think tonight was a real eye-opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3650.724s">Tonight</a> was a real eye-opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3653.457s">when</a> you hear firsthand accounts of what's taking place in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3658.781s">And</a> we can no longer turn a blind eye anymore in this community and pretend that nothing's happening because we're the city of Medford and, you know, we're a great community and things like that don't happen in Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3673.212s">As</a> we heard tonight, it happens in every socioeconomic, on all different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3679.757s">No</a> one's immune to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3682.577s">It's</a> evident, even when you turn on the TV and see famous movie stars that are going through the same addictions and have passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3691.14s">And</a> this is not to any particular class, not to particular to any ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3698.002s">This</a> impacts everyone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3701.223s">And</a> I really would like to take a vote tonight of this council going on record, saying that we believe there's an epidemic in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3709.77s">that</a> needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3711.831s">We</a> may need to call in state officials in this also, state delegation, you know, and to this, Mr. President, whatever it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3721.534s">But</a> I think it's about time that we put the same emphasis, as was mentioned tonight, on fixing potholes in our roads, on making sure that we have public safety and making sure that the community is operating well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3738.71s">And</a> in one aspect, we have a part of the community that many people aren't aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3743.994s">It's</a> almost like an underground thing that's going on that many people aren't aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3749.617s">And</a> I think we have to raise it up and maybe make it a front-page story. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3753.1s">I</a> know the transcript's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3754.941s">Make</a> it a front-page story. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3756.522s">Let</a> people know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3758.503s">And</a> maybe we can bring this community together and fight this very deadly disease, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3764.667s">And</a> I would move that we take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3768.243s">by</a> this council to say that there's an epidemic in this community and that emergency attention is needed to fight this war on drugs and narcotics in this community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5606.157s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5606.798s">Councilor</a> Marks, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5609.702s">Mr.</a> President, as part of the paperwork, it asked the petitioner to answer a question whether or not they have any outstanding violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5619.084s">And</a> that is incumbent upon the petitioner to state whether they have any violations or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5626.106s">The</a> Corey check checks for criminal offender record information and doesn't look, I don't believe, and maybe Councilor Camuso would know this better, I don't believe it looks at outstanding tickets, does it? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5638.92s">the,</a> the, the Corey, um, maybe it might be a good idea to have along the process somehow, uh, the petitioners of all taxi licenses to submit to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5650.829s">In</a> addition to the paperwork, um, uh, a record showing that, uh, they are free from any type of liability when it comes to tickets.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5709.544s">So</a> the chief signing off.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5758.136s">I</a> would just say if that's correct, what the chief is telling us, and we go based on the chief, then those two questions within the application itself are meaningless then because the chief is telling us he finds no fault.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6011.576s">Opposed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6011.937s">Opposition.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6142.228s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6143.729s">We</a> received a letter in our packet, a legal opinion from City Solicitor Rumley, and last week's packet dated February 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6153.095s">It</a> was in regard to paper 15-043, and the resolution that I offered, which many members behind this reeling have offered in the past, was to allow for 15 <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6171.878s">slash</a> 30 minute free parking in our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6176.139s">Um,</a> at the time, uh, when it was mentioned by many members of this council and supported by this council unanimously on several occasions, uh, that, uh, we, uh, weren't aware whether the traffic commission, because there is contractual language that exists right now between the city of method and Republic, which does our, uh, parking program, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6199.128s">whether</a> or not we needed to amend the contract or whether the traffic commission, which is a city commission, had the authority under its jurisdiction to vote for 15 or 30 minute free parking in the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6217.197s">City</a> solicitor responded back in the letter and quite clearly stated it's under the jurisdiction of the traffic commission to change the 15 to 30 minute free parking <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6229.028s">and</a> also the times of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6231.349s">And</a> as we all know, several weeks back, the Traffic Commission voted to change the enforcement times from 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6240.133s">to</a> 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6242.674s">to</a> 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6244.395s">to</a> 6 p.m.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6257.348s">I</a> honestly don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6258.348s">I</a> assume once the vote was taken, it becomes effective and they did take the vote on it several weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6264.331s">I</a> mean, we'd have to get a clarification from the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6268.932s">Um,</a> but so that the hours of operation has changed and I'm requesting, um, that, uh, we provide, uh, free parking at least 15 to 30 minute free parking in our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6282.065s">Many</a> business members that I've spoken to, I've heard them loud and clear that this would alleviate a bulk, not all concerns, but a bulk of the concerns for people running in and doing the quick errand, people running in and getting a sandwich in a sub shop, people running in and doing business in their insurance company, people running into the corner store and maybe playing a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6307.179s">A</a> lot of different reasons, getting a newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6309.661s">This</a> would alleviate a lot of the people that are just running into the stores for a quick time, and there's no need to feed the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6318.647s">For</a> those that want to stay for an extended period of time, 30 minutes or over, then there would be a need after that to feed the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6329.394s">I</a> think this will help businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6331.955s">I</a> think it will help residents that I've been hearing from also that would <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6336.282s">love</a> to be able to go down into any of our squares, park briefly, do their business, and move on with their daily lives, not having to worry to go up to the kiosk and feed the kiosk, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6352.088s">So</a> I would ask that we take a vote in this simple request, requesting that the Traffic Commission at their next meeting take up the issue of 15- to 30-minute free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6365.989s">The</a> reason why it was worded 15 to 30 minutes, I know the resolutions before this council, I know Councilor Lungo has offered it, I believe Councilor Camuso, Councilor Penta, and, you know, we've all mentioned different times, 15, 30 minutes, but ultimately they're going to make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6382.952s">So</a> if they decide, you know, they might want to do 45 minutes, but I think at least if we put a time in there, 15 to 30 minutes, it gives them a starting block, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6394.545s">So</a> I would request that this be sent to the Traffic Commission for their immediate review and hopefully approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6461.836s">Just</a> a quick point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6463.437s">The</a> convenience fee, is that contractual or is that something that's not? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6468.161s">We</a> got word on that already?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6482.717s">So</a> I don't, I have no problem asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6484.258s">I</a> think it's a good suggestion, but as long as it's not part of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6487.701s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6488.061s">Councilors.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7234.923s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7236.424s">I</a> received two calls from residents of the Riverside Tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7242.589s">They</a> were concerned that the hallways seemed to be very cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7247.832s">The</a> residents called the management company and the management company told them that it's their protocol to keep the hallways between <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7256.744s">62</a> and 68 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7259.345s">The</a> woman at the Riverside Tower asked me to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7265.229s">I</a> went by on my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7266.87s">I</a> went into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7269.071s">I</a> stood near, as we all know, the front door, which is accessed a lot, the Riverside Tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7274.675s">And</a> it was absolutely freezing after the second set of doors in that particular lobby area. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7281.299s">Do</a> they manage this chamber as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7284.55s">I</a> don't know if they manage this chamber, but it's about the same degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7288.573s">And</a> I did go on to a couple of the floors, Mr. President, and it seemed to be, I had a coat on too, and it seemed to be somewhat cold in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7298.401s">I</a> contacted, I looked online and contacted the management company, federal management company, and I have to say, I got an email back immediately from Joseph Moscarello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7310.691s">He</a> is the senior property manager for the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7313.632s">And</a> he also responded via email and phone call back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7319.216s">And</a> he mentioned to me that he sent his maintenance person out to each of the floors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7324.74s">And</a> they did notice that some of the floors were actually below 62. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7329.944s">And</a> they're going to try to rectify some of the concerns they're having with the heating system in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7335.087s">He</a> also mentioned to me, which I found interesting, was the front door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7339.738s">stays</a> ajar when it opens automatically for 40 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7343.901s">You</a> can imagine every time someone comes and goes, and that door stays open for 40 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7349.146s">Needless</a> to say, they're going to look at the duration of the cycle on that particular front door and see if they can get it closed quicker without also providing some concerns with residents trying to access the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7363.236s">But</a> I do want to report, Mr. President, that Mr. Moscarello <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7368.301s">seems</a> to be on top of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7370.502s">He</a> said that there would be improvements in the temperature in the hallways, throughout the floors, and assured me that if there were any concerns that the management company, like I said, Federal Management Company, would be more than happy to seek some type of <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7393.243s">a</a> remedy for residents of that building, Mr. President, so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7398.306s">My</a> motion is actually to place this, why don't we just receive and place on file.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_7XOxP2SN444/2025-03-21_7XOxP2SN444.html">Medford City Council - February 3, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=408.344s">Mr.</a> President, this particular area where the injury occurred is a high-traveled area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=414.849s">It's</a> the corner of High Street and Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=418.172s">So</a> I would ask that DPW be on notification if they're not already about this particular sinkhole and that something immediately be done at that site.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2857.79s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2859.15s">Regarding</a> the meeting that this council wants to hold with the Attorney General's office and also a representative from Lawrence Memorial Hospital or Hallmark Health, I would ask Alan McDonald, who I believe is second in command at <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2874.05s">Hallmark</a> Health has appeared before this council a number of times, and I would ask that we invite him in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2882.433s">And</a> also, we invite the mayor or someone from the administration to be present at this meeting, because the mayor has the same vested interest of the health of Moss Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2895.318s">And</a> I read some of the opinion, and from what I gather, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2901.936s">One</a> of the chief complaints was the fact that they believed if partners were to take over Hallmark Health, that partners would be able to control the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2912.722s">And</a> we all know that right away, insurance companies, who is really the thousand-pound elephant in the room, it's not the hospitals, it's the insurance companies, they're the ones that are driving the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2925.67s">And</a> their fear is that if partners gain more of a control over <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2930.125s">the</a> health industry in Massachusetts, that partners would be able to have more say at the table and increase rates and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2939.01s">And</a> I just think that, as I mentioned before, I actually work for Mass General. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2946.994s">And</a> in my opinion, implementing and bringing world-renowned physicians into a local hospital was a win-win for every resident in this community when you're talking about bringing <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2960.167s">top</a> cardiac doctors into Lawrence Memorial Hospital, top primary care doctors, doctors across all specialties that would be coming and merging into Lawrence Memorial Hospital, as well as Melrose-Wakefield, was a win-win for Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2977.893s">And</a> I'm very fearful of its future with this particular opinion and the ruling that was, as Councilor Camuso mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2986.075s">And</a> I think we should have <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2988.046s">a</a> meeting sooner than later, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2990.747s">Hallmark</a> Health, where this is so recent, is probably not going to go on the record stating what their next step is, because I think it was asked by — I think it might have been Councilor Knight when Hallmark Health was up here and said, you know, this is plan A. Do you have a plan B? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3005.491s">And</a> Mr. — President Sack from Hallmark Health said, no, we just have a plan A. This is our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3012.333s">And</a> where this is so recent, I'm not sure if they're going to share any information, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3016.393s">I</a> think it's incumbent upon us as a council and also the administration to push back and find out what's going on with the hospital because, in my opinion, from hearing from President Sack, I'm not sure how much Lawrence Memorial or Hallmark as an organization can sustain their operations and the capacity they're doing currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3038.89s">And</a> that worries me for urgent care in our community and things that many <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3046.802s">residents</a> and seniors have become accustomed to may no longer be in their back doorstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3052.127s">And</a> that concerns me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3053.668s">So</a> I would ask that, uh, this, uh, meeting, if not an emergency meeting, but something take place, uh, immediately, uh, regarding this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3277.116s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3278.337s">And</a> I actually brought up the Foodmaster, actually the old Foodmaster, now the Stop and Shop parking lot on Salem Street, and also mentioned this particular establishment that caught on fire well over two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3291.787s">I</a> believe it was called the Lucky Dragon, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3297.223s">But</a> needless to say, Mr. President, you know, I think it's probably appropriate time now to have a roundtable discussion on our downtown business districts, and that would include all five business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3313.651s">You</a> know, we've been discussing and the mayor has been discussing the revitalization of our major business district, Medford Square, for the past 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3323.436s">And</a> if anything, there are more vacant storefronts now than <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3326.885s">existed</a> when he took office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3329.066s">And,</a> in my opinion, Mr. President, I don't see any activity being done in any of our business districts to make them more of a welcoming area to try to attract newer businesses into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3345.914s">Surrounding</a> communities are offering tax incentives to local businesses and small businesses to attract them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3353.037s">They're</a> trying to attract a variety of business <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3355.955s">So</a> you just don't have, you know, all of one particular business or two different type of businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3362.837s">That</a> makes it more attractive for people that want to come in and traverse the downtown business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3369.578s">A</a> few months ago, I offered a resolution to look at the transportation shelter across from the CVS on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3378.8s">We</a> got a response back from the administration saying they'll take it under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3384.54s">which</a> is, in my opinion, unacceptable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3388.903s">That</a> particular shelter definitely could be reused for another purpose in our community, whether it be for arts or whether it be for retail or whether it be an inviting place to attract people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3406.014s">When</a> they did the square of the revitalization plan in the square many years back, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3413.977s">One</a> of the omissions that was mentioned in the report was the fact that there are no gathering areas in our downtown business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3425.261s">And</a> there's not a place where you can sit down and have a cup of coffee and relax in an outdoor setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3431.183s">And</a> that was one of the big downsides on our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3434.944s">And</a> there was discussion about widening our sidewalks, adding more benches, and doing a number of things in our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3443.51s">And</a> I saw that particular reuse of that transportation shelter, which is crumbling right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3449.453s">The</a> roof is in need of a roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3452.475s">The</a> gutters are missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3454.016s">The</a> paint's peeling off the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3456.537s">It's</a> really not being used at all right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3459.139s">And</a> the repurposing of that for another use could have an area where we could have people that would come and sit down and turn it into a vibrant area rather than something that's currently neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3471.627s">But</a> it's long overdue in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3475.088s">We</a> need to sit down with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3478.008s">The</a> mayor controls the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3481.549s">And</a> in my opinion, you know, I don't want to be critical of anyone in particular, but in my opinion, that department is sorely understaffed and is not serving the purpose of a community development office like I see happening in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3497.971s">And</a> it's about time, if we're interested in <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3502.019s">Revitalizing,</a> Councilor Caraviello is interested in Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3505.682s">He</a> brings up the Haines Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3507.583s">But</a> we have to look at the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3509.445s">We</a> have to look at South Medford, West Medford, Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3513.068s">We</a> have to look at every particular area, Mr. President, in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3517.071s">And</a> we have to have a game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3519.392s">There</a> is no, when we were talking about capital improvements a few years back, the one thing that was lacking was there was no vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3527.679s">There</a> was never a capital improvement plan established in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3531.943s">And</a> we're seeing the same with our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3534.925s">There</a> is no plan to revitalize our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3538.708s">And,</a> you know, we can refer back to the mayor's three proposals for revitalizing Method Square, but none of them have made it out of infancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3548.574s">They're</a> all still in the baby carriage, and they never make it any further than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3553.817s">And</a> every so often, people get upset and say, what's going on in our squares? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3557.919s">I</a> see all these vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3559.72s">After</a> 7 o'clock, the square's dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3561.581s">And</a> all you need to do is look around other communities and see what Wakefield's doing, see what Redding's doing, see what Stoneham's doing, see what downtown Woburn's doing in areas that before, you know, really weren't, you know, bustling. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3577.408s">Now</a> we're bustling. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3578.689s">And</a> here we are five minutes from Boston off of Major 93, and our square is dead, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3586.153s">It</a> really is a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3587.937s">And</a> I know there's a group of residents that have organized around this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3592.879s">I'm</a> hoping they step forward and bring this to light. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3596.52s">But</a> I don't think we can afford to sit around any longer and discuss a possible Peace Garden or a water taxi as the solve-all for Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3608.105s">You</a> know, once we bring in a water taxi, all of a sudden the square is going to be bustling. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3612.806s">Or</a> once the Peace Garden comes in, it's going to attract people into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3617.714s">I</a> don't think that's going to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3619.216s">This</a> is not the field of dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3620.939s">If</a> you build it, they'll come. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3622.621s">In</a> my opinion, the city's going to have to step forward, do some legwork in the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3627.484s">It's</a> not going to just happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3628.845s">We</a> have three large parcels of land in our downtown business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3633.586s">Any</a> other community would die to have that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3637.128s">We</a> own the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3638.188s">We</a> don't have to go in by eminent domain. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3640.069s">We</a> don't have to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3641.49s">That's</a> our property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3642.79s">We</a> can revitalize that on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3645.551s">And</a> these parcels have been sitting there vacant for years and years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3650.453s">I</a> just don't know what it's going to take, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3652.994s">And,</a> you know, I'm sorry for being long-winded. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3655.295s">But</a> this business districts in the community is the lifeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3659.397s">You</a> know, we talk about different things that are the lifeline of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3664.199s">The</a> downtown business districts are a lifeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3667.14s">Your</a> property value is directly related to how well the schools do, and also the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3673.423s">And</a> right now, our business community is not doing well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3677.724s">It's</a> not doing well, and we need to step up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3680.205s">And</a> I'm hoping we can have, and I'd like to put it to a vote tonight, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3684.75s">a</a> roundtable discussion regarding the revitalization of all five business districts in our community with the administration, with the Office of Community Development, and with whoever else wants to sit down at the table, and with this council, Mr. President, and discuss the future of our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3702.465s">So</a> I put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3740.322s">I'm</a> not looking for a plan that's going to encompass all the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3745.385s">What</a> I want to do is start the dialogue with this roundtable discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3749.747s">And</a> I don't think we can paint a picture of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3753.91s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3754.37s">Every</a> square is individual and has its own needs and wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3757.872s">And</a> I think we just need to start the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3761.494s">And</a> I agree with the President that an economic development plan is a great start, but it has to be started somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3769.44s">and</a> I don't see it being done on the administration side.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4476.201s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4477.241s">I</a> remember when they had the dedication down at Placed at Park some many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4482.803s">That</a> was the first time I met Bill Mumbo-Katt. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4485.66s">And</a> out of all the accolades, as Councilor Penter alluded to, no hitter and all-star league named and so forth, the one thing that stands out to me was his commitment to local youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4500.11s">And</a> he never looked for any fanfare, never looked for any recognition, but he'd always be at certain events, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4508.736s">And,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4510.353s">And</a> I think it meant a lot, even though the younger kids, you know, you hear the name and you could tell them who he was, you know, really could never appreciate that this man was, in his time, was someone that was really looked up to and someone that was at the top of his game, at the top of his sport, never had anything negative mentioned about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4534.284s">In</a> today's day and age, when you hear about sports players, there's always something mentioned after the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4540.63s">And</a> with Bill Mumbo, you never got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4542.852s">As</a> Councilor Penta mentioned and the other councilors, he was a stand-up gentleman, a family man, and again, gave so much back to a community that he loved so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4554.76s">And</a> I'll always remember him for being part of the local youth in this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5180.538s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President, the last meeting that was held at the BB Junior High, the concerns I got from local residents was that <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5191.043s">The</a> room was filled with 95% Malden residents and the few Method residents that took the time to go up, a lot of their issues were dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5205.427s">And</a> that is a concern of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5207.468s">And</a> when I brought up the issue back, I believe it was two months ago, I asked that the city administration take a lead role in this on notification, which residents weren't notified of the first meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5220.927s">They</a> found out through just some local talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5226.528s">And</a> secondly, Mr. President, this council voted unanimously to put some type of barrier or arm on the Medford side of Lund Road, where the entrance is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5237.711s">And</a> I don't think we got a response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5239.932s">I</a> don't remember receiving a response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5242.152s">I</a> know the chief was in support of making sure that that wasn't open to access traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5248.594s">Emergency</a> vehicle, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5250.218s">but</a> not as a cut-through for access traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5252.839s">So,</a> you know, I'd like to get a response back from the administration on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5258.281s">And</a> I also just read recently that the homes that were anticipated that were going to be on the Medford side are all gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5267.205s">There</a> is no plans for homes on the Medford side at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5270.846s">So,</a> I think that's a little different than what Councilor Penta just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5274.648s">I</a> know we had a conversation as that gentleman reached out to all of us, but I just recently read <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5280.781s">that</a> Methodists not going to have any building at all on our side. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5285.622s">And</a> they were going to honor the buffer, the wooded buffer along the property lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5291.304s">So</a> I just want to make sure that the city administration, I know they're having a meeting tomorrow night, but I want to make sure that the city administration is well represented there because they're supposed to be representing the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5304.287s">And</a> 530 meeting might be tough for people to make it to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5307.528s">And</a> we should know that there's someone <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5309.704s">fighting</a> on our behalf, whether it's the community development director, the mayor himself, the building department, someone from the administration or several people should be there, Mr. President also. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5320.312s">So</a> I would have that as a, as part of this motion that, um, you know, I appreciate we were invited, but also the administration should be well represented.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5345.35s">And</a> the barrier that we already voted on.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5352.694s">There's</a> a barrier on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5355.075s">There's</a> a barrier on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5357.236s">Is</a> it a cement barrier, Chief, or is it, I think it's a cement barrier that's over there, but we were talking about, they can easily remove that cement barrier and we didn't want the road to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5367.741s">They're</a> not even building it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5370.233s">No,</a> the barrier itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5371.313s">That</a> could be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5372.654s">They</a> don't need approval from the City of Medford to remove their own barrier. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5376.754s">And</a> once that's removed, that remains an open access road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5380.075s">And</a> we wanted to prohibit that from being an open access road by building our own barrier on our side.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6979.638s">I</a> thought when we discussed this originally, these were tickets issued for parking in front of a fire hydrant, parking in a handicapped spot, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6989.003s">And</a> I thought this council voted to say, we're not going to eliminate any tickets, uh, for that, for that period. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6995.607s">I</a> understand what the council is saying about the vehicle going around and the registration and the whole, a lot of other issues that were mentioned, but, but I thought we voted against saying to waive tickets on the 15th and 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7007.453s">So</a> I'm not quite sure why this was even on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7010.574s">I</a> thought we removed this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7600.757s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7602.018s">I</a> just have a question, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7604.519s">This</a> council has asked on several occasions that we increase the free parking and we've offered suggestions the first 15 minutes free citywide up to 30 minutes free citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7619.591s">And</a> the response back we got from the administration was, as a result of meetings with the business community, they provided two free 30-minute spots and also four single-head meters in each of the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7635.341s">So</a> the free spots would amount to 10 free spots citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7642.445s">So</a> each of the five business districts would have two free spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7647.532s">I</a> agree with the, uh, limited hours of operation, changing it from seven to seven, uh, from seven to seven to eight to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7655.275s">And</a> that falls under your purview as a traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7658.596s">I</a> would also say, uh, 30 minute free parking would also fall under the traffic commissions purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7665.238s">Uh,</a> would you agree with that chief?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7682.085s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7682.305s">But</a> if under, from what I hear, uh, as a rule of thumb, if we don't change the number of meted spots, we fall within the guidelines of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7692.873s">This</a> is from what I understand by, uh, adding a 30 minute free parking for the first 30 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7700.318s">We're</a> not changing the number of meted spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7702.964s">And</a> in my opinion, I'm not a legal counsel, but I would say that that would fall under the jurisdiction of the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7710.708s">And</a> from what I hear from business owners, we had Jimmy from West Medford come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7715.75s">We've</a> heard from a number of business owners, a number of residents that want to run into the store for two minutes and pick up a newspaper or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7723.874s">This</a> would solve a lot of issues, Chief, a lot, a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7728.036s">And</a> if it falls under your purview, I think it goes hand in hand with <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7733.365s">the</a> limiting of the hours of operation also. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7737.288s">And</a> I think this is a necessity, Chief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7790.878s">Well,</a> I don't know at what point are we in violation of the contract if we make changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7795.839s">I</a> really don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7796.84s">I</a> don't think anyone behind this reeling totally understands.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7818.338s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7818.618s">But</a> as you know, the whole reason that we implemented this was to move cars along. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7824.02s">And</a> providing a 15 or 30-minute grace period accomplishes such that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7828.461s">It</a> still moves cars along. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7830.542s">So</a> I don't see that we'd be going back from what our mission was to move cars along in the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7836.944s">And</a> if you're able to take two hours a day off of their enforcement, that's revenue that they could be generating, yet minusing two hours <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7844.445s">I</a> don't see why 30 minutes would be any different.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7856.908s">We</a> don't have any statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7858.048s">We</a> have no data yet.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7880.023s">I</a> think that's a sad commentary when you can say from seven to eight, there's no cars there anyways.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7886.928s">I</a> mean, it's limited because it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7889.07s">It's</a> limited because there's no magnets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7892.292s">Mr.</a> President, I would ask then if we have to do this piecemeal, um, that, uh, we asked the city solicitor by a vote of this council, whether or not, uh, we could implement, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7903.177s">either</a> 15 or 30-minute free parking citywide, and if that's under the purview of the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7911.343s">And</a> once we get that response back, because the response we received back from the administration, it says no additional changes will be made at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7921.27s">That</a> would lead me to believe that changes could be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7925.173s">That</a> would lead me to believe that changes could be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7928.336s">And</a> so I think maybe it's appropriate that <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7931.935s">we</a> get a legal opinion from the city solicitor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7960.71s">or</a> 30 minute free parking citywide that is, whether that falls under the purview of the traffic commission or if it's a contractual agreement that needs to be done.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8630.743s">I</a> just got one last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8632.464s">A</a> gentleman called me, a gentleman called me up chief on this brochure that was passed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8638.905s">And</a> he mentioned that when he tried to feed the machine, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8643.561s">He</a> said he believes the steps are backwards, Step 4 and 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8648.424s">So</a> he said he went, he put in his license plate number, and then Step 4 says, press the blue button to buy time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8657.168s">He's</a> saying that you're supposed to press the green button, then put the money in, and then press the blue button. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8667.554s">He</a> said these steps aren't right.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8674.311s">Can</a> you take a look at that, Chief?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8680.813s">Complete</a> transaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8682.794s">Can</a> you take a peek at that, Chief?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c/2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c.html">Medford City Council - January 20, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1022.97s">How</a> many clients can you accommodate on a daily average?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1031.659s">100.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1032.44s">And</a> what is your staff to client ratio?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1039.025s">1</a> to 6 is state regulations?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1054.889s">Do</a> you have any nurses on site? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1057.551s">Do</a> you have any nurse practitioners?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1074.301s">So</a> you dispense medication on site?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1079.024s">Is</a> medication kept on site?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1087.715s">So</a> is medication kept overnight?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1094.959s">So</a> if it's kept overnight, is there... It's a medical cart.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1102.042s">This</a> is locked and...
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1110.229s">Are</a> there any regulations that govern the security of medications?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1115.811s">And</a> you'll be adhering to all those regulations? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1118.813s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1119.614s">Locally,</a> does the Board of Health oversee your area?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1140.969s">And</a> have you had a walkthrough yet at the site?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1145.432s">So</a> that hasn't taken place yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1147.174s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1154.9s">Well,</a> I'd like to see how process is the last step. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1159.781s">all</a> the papers ahead of time.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1200.252s">You</a> also mentioned that you provide three meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1203.254s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1203.474s">What</a> other activities are done with the... <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1207.122s">people</a> that are staying there for the day.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1210.905s">Other</a> than eating, what else do they do?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1264.241s">So</a> is the actual setup inclusive? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1266.462s">Is</a> everyone together or are they in separate rooms or separate areas? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1270.183s">It</a> depends.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1302.662s">And</a> just my last question, do you do any outreach at all?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1307.864s">Well,</a> once you get started, if someone is a client.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1320.249s">Mystic</a> Valley?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2815.767s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2817.468s">Um,</a> you know, I, I don't think anyone behind this real disputes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2821.19s">The</a> fact that this council has been pushing for years and I is one member for parking enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2830.776s">I</a> don't think anyone disputes that how we arrived at that and where we are today is due to a plan that the mayor signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2839.007s">And</a> I don't dispute that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2840.789s">This</a> is the mayor's plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2842.53s">He's</a> the one that signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2844.251s">Yes,</a> the council did take several votes, but not on the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2849.935s">And</a> we've heard members of the council already state, like Councilor Knight mentioned today, he's not happy with the $0.35 surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2858.342s">Now,</a> at the time, was that an issue that was brought up, that we discussed, that we talked about, that we voted on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2864.184s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2865.324s">Councilor</a> Camuso said last week that he's against kiosks and prefers parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2871.366s">Now,</a> was that an issue that we took a vote on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2874.107s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2875.387s">So</a> it was the length... <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2879.74s">It's</a> in the records.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2883.323s">We</a> did not take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2884.804s">And</a> Mr. President, if you could indulge me for a moment.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2889.668s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2890.008s">Because</a> it's important that we get this information out and that the people at home and the people in the audience are aware, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2898.035s">And</a> I'm not going to speak for anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2900.257s">I,</a> as one member of the council, never voted to outsource this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2907.382s">If</a> anything, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2908.275s">It</a> was myself, Councilor Wong-Tam and Councilor Penta that pushed at the beginning to take this program in house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2914.545s">We</a> thought we could accomplish this in house by our own staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2919.432s">A</a> unanimous vote by this Council, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2923.347s">Kiosk</a> versus meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2925.248s">I</a> never took a vote on kiosk versus meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2927.549s">When</a> I sat on the committee back some five years ago, our mission was to look at other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2933.331s">And</a> our recommendation back to the mayor was, Mr. Mayor, we looked at other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2938.032s">Boston</a> uses a combination of kiosk and meters and other surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2942.821s">and</a> their parking lots use kiosks and meters on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2947.065s">We</a> didn't make our declarative recommendation on which way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2951.209s">That</a> was the mayor's choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2953.03s">Then</a> we heard recently about raising business and commuter permit fees for permit parking from 100 to 400. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2962.218s">Did</a> anyone behind this reeling vote to raise business or commuter fees <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2967.803s">commuter</a> permit parking from $100 to $400? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2970.784s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2972.884s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2974.485s">7</a> a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2975.105s">to</a> 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2976.125s">on</a> the paid-for parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2977.546s">Who</a> voted behind the reeling to have it for 12 hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2981.506s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2982.007s">I</a> didn't vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2982.887s">Did</a> anyone else vote to have it for 12 hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2985.427s">And</a> now we're hearing the concerns that people would like to see it less to help business out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2991.229s">The</a> $3 surcharge on resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2994.07s">Did</a> we vote for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2995.91s">And</a> then it was just the company just took it back now, knowing that on a $10 permit parking, resident permit parking, $3 is excessive, and they took it back on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3006.032s">We</a> didn't vote for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3007.232s">The</a> $0.35 surcharge to use the Park Mobile for your pay phone, we didn't vote for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3013.114s">The</a> enforcement versus pay to park, we didn't vote for that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3019.544s">able</a> to support 30-minute free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3022.645s">Did</a> we get a vote on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3023.645s">We</a> all support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3024.825s">We've</a> heard it mentioned, whether it's 15 or 30 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3027.606s">Every</a> council said, I'd like to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3029.827s">Well,</a> if every council likes to see that, and we're saying that we supported the mayor's proposal, why is it in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3035.468s">I</a> want to know why it's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3036.789s">Because</a> we didn't vote on the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3039.049s">We</a> did not vote on the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3042.09s">And</a> I can't say it enough, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3044.071s">The</a> validation program, that was recently created a couple of weeks ago, and the mayor nixed it shortly after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3051.495s">The</a> kiosk, where the kiosk are located. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3053.816s">Who</a> voted on that behind this reeling? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3055.957s">We</a> sat down and said, where the kiosk could be located? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3058.918s">That</a> was under the mayor's plan, not under our vote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3063.8s">Also,</a> keeping the appeal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3066.181s">The</a> one thing that we didn't outsource was the appeal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3069.983s">And</a> everyone told us, and I know Gwen Blackburn's in the audience, and every city that we went to said, keep the appeal process out of City Hall, keep it away from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3078.948s">The</a> one thing that may have kept in City Hall was the appeal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3082.57s">Did</a> members of the council vote for that to keep it here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3085.152s">Absolutely</a> not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3087.853s">Also,</a> to post signs on trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3091.195s">Was</a> that a vote of this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3092.876s">I</a> personally know that it's against the city policy to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3097.299s">That</a> wasn't a vote of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3101.075s">So,</a> Mr. President, I think what we have to be careful here is, you know, the mayor's a big boy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3107.861s">This</a> is the mayor's plan, and he should be able to come forward and say, this is what I thought was best for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3114.547s">But</a> to run and hide at a time when the residents of this community need direction, Mr. President, is incomprehensible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3123.375s">It</a> really is, Mr. President, whether he's on vacation or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3127.754s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3128.615s">Well,</a> just let me finish, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3130.676s">Whether</a> he's on vacation or not, Mr. President, he's had ample opportunity to appear before the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3137.321s">Whether</a> it's a reverse 911 call, whether it's on local access stations, whether it's not having a press conference, which he knows how to do very readily in his office, he has failed to appear before this council and the community and explain his pay-for-parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3156.047s">Now,</a> if he's in favor of it, he should get out there and push for it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3161.151s">But</a> I'm not going to be tagged, Mr. President, because every inch of the way, I had questions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3166.596s">And</a> questions are still coming up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3169.458s">And</a> for my vote from five years ago, back in 2009, along with the committee the mayor appointed, was to provide consistent parking enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3180.027s">and</a> not to go to a pay-for-parking program right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3183.95s">And</a> that was my vote from day one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3186.753s">And</a> this has taken on, as a speaker said earlier, we went from a plan of small nature, just trying to improve enforcement and moving cars along, to a plan now where we're aggressively seeking out people and we're aggressively hurting <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3203.586s">local</a> business in this community, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3210.472s">So</a> I just want that to be, yes, the council did take several votes, Mr. President, but we had no meaningful dialogue or input to any of the language that was always under the mayor's purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3222.221s">And</a> as we can see, the program being tweaked now is because of the lack of involvement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3228.602s">and</a> we're paying the repercussions now on trying to figure out a program while we already signed a contract, and that's unfortunate.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3396.157s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3399.2s">Just</a> if I could, because Dr. Strella brings up a lot of great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3403.023s">And</a> I would just like to ask the doctor a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3405.746s">Yes,</a> that's a proper use of a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3407.928s">Because</a> he's a very astute person and very active with his body, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3412.131s">I</a> agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3413.893s">And</a> I'm glad you do.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3417.376s">As</a> you know, by state law, the mayor cannot enter into a contract over a term of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3422.841s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3423.697s">As</a> I understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3424.538s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3425.098s">So</a> when the three requests for proposals came back, they were all for a term greater than three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3432.024s">So</a> what you're saying to me as a member of the council at that point, we turned to the mayor and say, you know what, Mr. Mayor, if you can't negotiate a contract within three years, go back, go back to the drawing table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3443.414s">That's</a> what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3444.235s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3446.016s">That's</a> true. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3446.937s">Knowing</a> that there's a startup cost cause he outsourced everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3451.13s">And</a> in this case, it was close to a million dollar startup cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3454.833s">There</a> were no companies, John, that would come into the city, the way the mayor wanted to do it, would come into the city for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3464.159s">So</a> under your thought was just to go back to the mayor and say, you know what, we're not moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3469.803s">We're</a> not moving forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3471.884s">My</a> thought was at the time, allow the mayor to negotiate, and then we can have say in what the language will be, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3479.109s">That</a> was my thought.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3488.149s">But</a> as part of that right, as part of that, that, that vote we took, we also put a stipulation that the mayor will bring the proposal back to us for a final vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3497.474s">That</a> was council appendix resolution and it was voted on unanimously by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3502.957s">The</a> fact that the mayor never came back to us to allow us to make changes and to <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3507.931s">to</a> view the language is not, maybe it's a legal issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3512.972s">Maybe</a> it's a legal issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3514.113s">But</a> that is an amendment that we put on the resolution that allowed him to enter into a multi-year agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3520.894s">That</a> is the amendment, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3522.235s">And</a> I don't know any way of slicing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3524.495s">You're</a> right.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3526.596s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7020.865s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7022.967s">Just</a> if I could, I hear what Councilor Pente is stating, but from what we heard, the infractions dealt with parking in handicapped spot, parking in front of a hydrant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7031.973s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, I don't care how they got the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7035.831s">I</a> want them to issue tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7038.232s">That's</a> what they're there for, to issue tickets, and especially for infractions of parking in front of a hydrant, which is a danger, uh, in case of a fire or parking in a handicapped spot, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7049.416s">So</a> I hear what Councilor Prentice is stating, but I don't think we should be waiving any tickets for people that are in violation of parking in those particular spots, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7058.12s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Martz.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9661.085s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9664.386s">And</a> I appreciate Jean, and I appreciate your vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9668.147s">And</a> I think, you know, when it comes to the Office of Community Development, we as a community need to expect more from the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9677.56s">That's</a> the reason why we have an Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9681.428s">And,</a> you know, they do yeoman's work when it comes to finding grants and rehabbing parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9687.946s">or</a> allocating community block grant money every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9691.268s">They</a> do a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9693.37s">But</a> all you need to do is look at the five business districts in this community and wonder why we haven't revitalized one of our business districts in the last 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9704.178s">That's</a> all you need to wonder. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9705.999s">And,</a> you know, it's clear to me that the Office of Community Development has fallen far short of the mark when it comes to redevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9714.385s">This</a> administration has been in charge for 28 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9717.83s">And</a> I would submit to anyone in this community, Medford Square is no better off now than it was 28 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9726.476s">And</a> I would submit to you that the square was better off 28 years ago than what we have down there currently now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9734.642s">The</a> council voted several months back on Riverside Ave, the transportation little shuttle that we have across from the CVS on Riverside behind the burial ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9747.698s">We</a> voted to have it looked at for a possible repurpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9752.219s">Right</a> now, it's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9754.419s">The</a> roof is leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9756.18s">It's</a> in deplorable condition, and it's being utilized for next to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9760.78s">And</a> the response back we got from the administration was they'll take it under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9765.981s">These</a> are the type of things that, when issues are brought up, that there's no one at City Hall carrying the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9774.003s">There's</a> no one at City Hall looking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9776.425s">And</a> that's the problem that we face. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9779.006s">And,</a> you know, until there's a new administration in this city, we're going to see our business districts the way they are, in deplorable condition, in need of updating, in need of new traffic studies, new pedestrian crossings, traffic calming approaches, new facades. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9797.149s">The</a> whole issue — and it's — we spoke about Haines Square, I think it was last week, about the fire that took place at the Lucky Dragon Chinese restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9805.647s">That</a> was over two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9807.749s">And</a> it's still boarded up with action signs in the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9812.652s">That</a> was two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9814.453s">How</a> does a community allow an establishment in a business district to stay boarded up like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9820.177s">I</a> just don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9821.598s">And</a> is there any involvement from the Community Development Office or the Building Commissioner's Office to do something about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9828.183s">You're</a> talking about the liquor store as a blighted look and area, what about a boarded up <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9834.666s">establishment</a> that's been caught on fire two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9838.489s">And</a> this is, I think, what we're seeing across the community, not just Haynes Square, West Medford, the hillside, and our main anchor, which is Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9851.32s">And</a> the mayor has commissioned three separate reports to revitalize Medford Square, has spent several hundred thousand dollars to come out with <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9861.048s">a</a> plan to revitalize Medford Square and has done nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9865.57s">And</a> that's over a 25 year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9869.211s">So</a> I guess when we talk about parking enforcement taking five years and the mayor's vision, that's pretty quick because the revitalization of Medford Square is still ongoing after 25 years in the police department after 50 something years chief, which we won't call you up to the podium in the library, 50 something years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9890.742s">So,</a> I guess it's par for the course how we're working and, you know, I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9896.503s">I</a> don't think it should be done by a citizen advisory board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9899.364s">It</a> should be done by the people that we're paying their salary, hefty salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9905.065s">And,</a> you know, that's what should take place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9908.066s">And</a> the mayor needs to put an emphasis on the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9912.166s">And</a> some of all their staff is probably seven times larger than our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9917.547s">We</a> have one full-time person who's the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9920.907s">one</a> part-time person, and there may be someone else answering the phones in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9925.368s">That's</a> our Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9929.089s">I</a> don't know what you're gonna get out of it, other than what we're already getting, which is just the minimal day-to-day, keep the office going, but no improvements to our infrastructure or any thought of revitalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9942.532s">But</a> I appreciate your thoughts, Jeanne.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10030.039s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10031.78s">Maybe</a> if we can ask the mayor more of a poignant question, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10036.051s">of</a> what are his plans to revitalize our five business districts, because you can only be told so many times about a plan that was drafted 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10046.836s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10047.456s">You</a> can only be told so many times about that outdated plan until people realize and unmask the masquerade that's going on that nothing is happening in this city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10252.442s">Uh,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10254.043s">It</a> was brought to my attention recently by a method resident that <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10259.313s">The</a> Gaming Act, which we're all aware of, which was the creating legislation to create casinos in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10268.398s">As</a> part of that, there was a community mitigation fund that was established, and this was to offset costs related to gaming for communities and surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10281.205s">There</a> is a one-time, and this is why I wanted to bring it up tonight, there's a one-time <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10289.278s">2015</a> reserve that's allocated to surrounding communities, of which we are named right within the one-time policy that was put out as being one of the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10306.451s">And</a> it states, if I could read it, Mr. President, because there's a time frame that's associated with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10312.63s">It</a> says, in recognition that communities may not be able to demonstrate many significant impacts by February 2, 2015, and in recognition of the commission's emphasis on proper local planning, the commission has established a one-time local reserve for the 2015 Community Mitigation Fund Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10333.434s">The</a> commission has reserved $100,000 for each designated surrounding community, each community which entered <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10341.297s">into</a> the nearby community agreement with a license and any community that petitioned to be a surrounding community to a gaming license, which we are one of them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10351.584s">This</a> reserve can be used to cover impacts that may arise in 2015 or thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10357.327s">It</a> may also be used for planning, either to determine how to achieve further benefits from a facility or to avoid or minimize any adverse impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10367.594s">We've</a> all spoken, Mr. President, about <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10370.353s">the</a> need for infrastructure improvements in Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10374.536s">The</a> deadline to apply for this is February 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10379.119s">I</a> want to send a response from this council to the administration to, first of all, to see if the administration has applied for this, where the deadline is approaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10391.046s">If</a> not, that they apply immediately, and that also this council go on record, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10397.828s">I</a> believe the number one concern is the traffic impact from what I've heard from residents and also from living in the Wellington area and what can be done to improve some of the potential congestion in the Wellington area which we all know will be one of the main major thoroughfares to the Wynn Casino when it eventually comes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10438.765s">That's</a> a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10441.007s">But</a> I think we should go on record at least asking the administration if they've applied before the February 2nd deadline and also <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10450.908s">What</a> are the thoughts of the use of the $100,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10454.09s">And</a> I would say transportation, flooding issues in the general area, I think, is a worthy suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10461.794s">Also,</a> recently, our own Councilor Rick Caraviello was named to the Community Mitigation Committee by the mayor, and he will sit on this committee as one person from this community and be fighting for <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10479.365s">mitigation</a> money to improve infrastructure and other economic engines in our community to help with the potential loss that a casino may bring into the local economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10491.213s">And,</a> you know, Councilor Caraviello, with his background in the chamber and his background in the community, I think was the perfect fit for this particular position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10501.961s">But</a> I would like to put that in the form of a resolution on the actual 2015 <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10507.793s">reserve</a> money, $100,000 that is earmarked to surrounding communities in which we were named. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10513.716s">Each.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10715.451s">My</a> suggestion, as I stated, is to look at infrastructure improvements, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10721.155s">transportation</a> improvements in the Wellington area, because I think that's going to be the biggest impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10727.559s">And</a> that's what I've heard from residents and business owners and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10731.382s">And</a> there will be some other impact to the local economy and businesses in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10735.909s">but</a> I think this should be one of the first priorities.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11033.62s">Just</a> one brief thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11035.001s">I</a> had the opportunity to attend the Martin Luther King third annual event, which was held yesterday at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11046.59s">There</a> had to be close to a hundred people that attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11051.373s">Part</a> of the program dealt with Medford High students along with their teacher, whose name escapes me right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11058.248s">students</a> that shared very touching stories of intolerance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11065.31s">And</a> there was roughly 13 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11068.85s">And</a> it was a real eye-opener, Mr. President, which really played in part of what took part in the whole civil rights process with Martin Luther King and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11082.225s">And</a> it was a great event. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11086.046s">I</a> know Councilor Caraviello was there, and John Falco from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11091.628s">And</a> I look forward to next year's event. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11094.989s">And</a> I want to personally thank each and every student that came up there to share such a personal story, some of which you may want to keep secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11107.174s">But</a> these students were willing to get up there and show that <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11111.897s">uh,</a> what their experience has been and, uh, how they, uh, improving and also how, uh, the city of method in many circumstances has united around, uh, these particular students, uh, to include them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11126.603s">And,</a> uh, it was very touching. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=11128.364s">Um,</a> and, um, again, I look forward to attending the event next year.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk/2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk.html">Medford City Council - January 13, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=740.699s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=742.02s">And</a> I think we've all voted in the past to create capital improvement funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=747.184s">Uh,</a> this is also a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=749.513s">I</a> agree with Councilor Knight that we do have an existing fund, which is called free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=757.539s">It's</a> nothing more than the taxpayer's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=760.561s">And</a> that has existed for many years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=763.382s">And</a> every time this council or members of this council have tried to use the free cash to either lower taxes or do some infrastructure improvement, we heard over and over again that they didn't want to tap into the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=777.769s">because</a> it might hurt the bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=780.391s">So</a> I'd be very hesitant on saying if we set up an account in the budget that we're going to be able to get the mayor, who's been very hesitant on using that free cash for other issues, to put money from free cash into this particular line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=795.565s">So</a> eventually this line item will have to be funded by an increase in taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=801.008s">There's</a> no way around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=802.668s">So</a> when we vote for the budget and the mayor just say wants to put $400,000 in this stabilization fund, that's going to come from the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=811.792s">Meanwhile,</a> we already have $6 million in free cash sitting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=816.415s">So</a> I don't want to see, to be quite honest with you, I think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=819.878s">a</a> great idea to have rainy day funds and everything else, but I believe we already have the means to do what we want for capital improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=827.901s">Not</a> on a major scale of building a police department, but on a smaller scale, we do have cash available to do infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=837.744s">So</a> I'd be very hesitant on setting up an account that is going to be additional, something that's going to be over and above what we already have out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=847.888s">As</a> Councilor Camuso mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=849.538s">We</a> have linkage money that business owners give to the community by city ordinance when they come in and build or renovate to a certain size in this community, they have to pay linkage money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=860.605s">We</a> have the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=862.026s">We</a> have the water and sewer enterprise account that has multi millions of dollars in surplus in those accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=869.691s">And</a> I realized those accounts can't be used for a lot of different issues only for water and sewer issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=875.474s">But,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=877.058s">I</a> think it's appropriate that we sit down, Committee of the Whole, whatever subcommittee, discuss this first before we make a step forward about putting this in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=887.801s">I</a> think it's a great idea, but I think it merits some discussion first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=892.602s">And</a> I, as one, think we should proceed with caution when we want to create a new account, because the only one that is going to fund this account is the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=901.724s">There's</a> no way around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=903.285s">And</a> I want to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=905.813s">Uh,</a> we, we know what's going to happen before we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=909.195s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1139.723s">Our</a> vote doesn't establish an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1141.684s">It's</a> a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1142.624s">It's</a> a recommendation to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1144.716s">I</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1144.896s">So,</a> so before we make a recommendation to the mayor, I rather dot our I's and cross our T's and make a recommendation based on maybe something with council and I mentioned about a certain percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1156.722s">Uh,</a> I don't see why we shouldn't send this to a committee, the whole first, and then take a vote on it after to send it to the mayor with our recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1165.047s">I</a> think that makes more sense than just asking to put, uh, the mayor put an account out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1170.81s">And</a> once, if you say he does establish the account, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1174.425s">Our</a> process is meaningless after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1176.646s">I</a> mean, we can go to them and say, Mr. Mayor, we do this and this, but it's meaningless. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1180.488s">I'd</a> rather hand them the full paper.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1553.763s">with</a> the city clerk is stating, we should check into, we should be prudent and check into if there is a stabilization account already established. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1564.088s">I</a> would prefer to use a stabilization fund outside of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1569.61s">And</a> I would caution the members of the council that once the mayor gets a report from us stating that he'd like to see a stabilization account within the budget, he'll go off and create one in the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1583.047s">He</a> may put $4 or $5 million in that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1587.709s">You're</a> not going to have any say in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1590.69s">All</a> you can do is vote up or down in the budget or reduce the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1595.712s">So</a> you'll have, just say, $4 or $5 million in an account this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1599.653s">Taxes</a> are going to go up because it's not part of the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1603.855s">And</a> then he's going to say the council requested that this take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1608.937s">And</a> then to use that line item in the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1612.092s">It's</a> not a vote of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1615.294s">So</a> the mayor could take that money out and do another project similar to the peace garden in the square or whatever else he wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1623.978s">So</a> I don't, I wouldn't be so quick tonight to just create a line item in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1629.901s">I</a> don't know what that gets us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1631.442s">I</a> rather sit back, have a committee, the whole meeting discuss this first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1635.764s">Maybe</a> we can bring in in Baker, the finance director, the treasurer collector, the mayor himself, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1642.318s">Anyone</a> else, and discuss this first, because I'm not quite sure a line item in the budget will be the appropriate way of keeping a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1651.861s">I</a> think it's a great idea, but I think if we could do it outside the budget through these revolving accounts, makes more sense, and also the council would have input eventually when the mayor wants to go into these particular accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1666.686s">He</a> would need support of the council, and there we can make sure, yes, we approve that project, Mr. Mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1672.535s">because</a> it's on the council's priority list as the police department or the library or wherever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1678.74s">It</a> could be road improvements, uh, crosswalk improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1682.242s">It</a> could be anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1683.543s">So</a> I, I, you know, I can't vote tonight on, uh, just, uh, getting a line item in the budget and then discussing it after the fact, because I've been around here a number of years and, uh, you know, I, I rather do it, uh, all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1698.615s">I</a> rather have a thoughtful plan that's outlined, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1702.462s">before</a> we just do a knee-jerk reaction about putting something in the budget that makes us feel good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1707.826s">I</a> mean, we all want a capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1709.807s">We've</a> all voted on it three dozen times. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1713.31s">But,</a> you know, it's ultimately up to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1715.992s">And</a> I'm not sure, you know, the feel-good reaction we're going to get tonight saying that, you know, we created a stabilization or a capital improvement fund as a line item in the budget is going to accomplish anything more than just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1730.582s">Creating</a> a line item in the budget, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1787.711s">I</a> know that's what the resolution reads, but I'm almost positive Councilor Camuso recommended, as part of this resolution, to put a line item in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1797.055s">So</a> that's different than what you just read. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1798.616s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1798.996s">And</a> I'm going to get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1799.876s">Yours</a> is more of a general statement, where he was specific, saying he wants us to vote on putting a line item in the budget.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1946.832s">Just</a> a point of clarification.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1949.794s">Just</a> a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1951.055s">So</a> we're voting on the language that currently exists under Councilor Camuso's resolution.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1978.122s">But</a> we're not approving a line item in the budget.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4105.961s">You</a> know, I just don't understand how, even if a garage was built in Method Square, how that's going to help the business owners in West Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4114.545s">Help</a> the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4116.166s">Oh,</a> if I could, Mr. President, help the business owners in Haines Square, help the business owners in South Method or up the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4122.828s">So</a> a parking garage, that's just a big red herring. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4126.01s">And</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4126.55s">That's</a> just a big red herring. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4128.271s">Uh,</a> you know, this is the mayor's pay for parking program.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4736.669s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4737.61s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4739.063s">Chief,</a> you're not kidding when you say there's been some modifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4741.404s">There's</a> been a lot of modifications, and I know this is a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4745.785s">And</a> I'm waiting the day that you come in here and say that we're not going to do pay-for-pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4751.788s">I</a> think that'll be the modification that everyone is looking for, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4755.909s">I</a> think all we need is consistent — all we need is consistent enforcement, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4763.672s">And</a> that was the recommendation made by the committee five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4767.522s">But</a> if I could just state, Chief, when this proposal was brought up by the mayor, he mentioned on several occasions with backing from this council that when this program officially starts, that there'd be at least a two-week grace period where tickets would not be real tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4786.698s">So</a> for two weeks, Republic would be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4790.941s">They'd</a> be doing, when this starts, this particular parking enforcement, and they'd give out a ticket that says, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4796.925s">In</a> two weeks from now, this will be a real ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4798.906s">Make</a> sure you feed your meat, or make sure you don't park in front of a hydrant, or make sure and give out fake tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4805.39s">And</a> I think we all agreed upon that, and I'm hearing nothing about that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4811.093s">Nothing</a> at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4811.874s">And</a> that was a major bone of contention with this council, because of the fact that this city has had lax enforcement for many, many years, and we're going into a program that, in my opinion, is very aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4825.68s">So</a> I'm very disappointed to hear that that's not going to take place.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4837.567s">I</a> know that there's been a lot of... We just got a phone call saying the enforcement is going to begin on the 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4842.57s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4843.37s">They</a> didn't say fake enforcement.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4854.219s">When</a> I say fake, it's not costing you anything.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4857.64s">But</a> Chief, the reverse has been happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4859.942s">We're</a> not doing any enforcement now, and we're letting residents put money in the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4866.365s">How</a> does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4868.927s">No</a> enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4869.807s">The</a> company's not doing their job, but we're asking residents to put money in a kiosk without enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4877.332s">I</a> just don't understand, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4878.793s">And</a> I'm not blaming you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4879.813s">I'm</a> not blaming you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4881.134s">But,</a> Chief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4891.48s">Chief,</a> you have a kiosk out in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4894.301s">You</a> have new signage.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4924.615s">Councilor</a> Mark still has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4927.156s">Just,</a> just if I could chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4928.217s">So,</a> so that's where something inconsistencies lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4931.659s">I</a> know the gentleman's here and I hope he can answer the question regarding the enforcement that's going to take place on the 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4937.962s">Uh,</a> my, my second point chief is when this, uh, plan, uh, that the mayor offered, uh, his plan from the get go was to do, uh, enforcement throughout every business district because it was mentioned that start off <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4952.33s">maybe</a> in phased approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4954.01s">Let's</a> do Medford Square first, that's our largest business district, and maybe phase it around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4958.731s">And</a> the mayor was adamant about saying, no, we're doing every business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4962.812s">And</a> I agreed with the mayor at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4965.112s">But</a> now we're seeing spot enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4968.233s">We're</a> seeing areas on Salem Street that are commercial areas that have kiosks and other areas that have nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4974.674s">And</a> I would agree with the gentleman from Dab's walk that came up over the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4979.935s">How</a> can you have a sub-shop in West Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4982.178s">that</a> the customers have to pay 50 cents to go in and get a sandwich, but on Salem Street, they don't have to pay anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4988.182s">I,</a> as a customer, might say, you know what, I'll drive three minutes up the street and save the 50 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4993.366s">You</a> have to treat every business the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4996.008s">There's</a> no way that we can phase in this type of approach, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4999.71s">So</a> whether the consultant plan from years ago said put kiosks in certain areas and not others, the city had to take a long, hard look and say, we have to treat everyone fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5010.697s">And</a> that's not happening right now, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5012.578s">And</a> I would hope that happens sooner than later.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5058.67s">But</a> Chief, I guess I'm saying we need consistency throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5061.611s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5062.192s">I</a> get that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5146.524s">Turnover</a> is created by consistent enforcement, not by kiosks, not by meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5153.13s">That's</a> not what turns spots over, it's consistent enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5156.872s">So</a> I don't want people to believe that just because a kiosk is out there, cars are gonna move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5162.517s">That's</a> not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5164.118s">It's</a> enforcement that moves cars along. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5166.54s">My</a> other point, Chief, was I received a call from a woman <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5169.643s">that</a> stated that she has a tough time finding out clearly where pay-for-parking starts and ends in a particular business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5180.172s">So</a> when you pull up, and I would agree, sometimes it's very confusing when you pull into Medford Square and you don't know where the pay-for-parking really ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5190.32s">The</a> signage might point this or that way, but it's very difficult and there's gotta be a better way of marking where pay-for-parking is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5198.817s">I</a> think that's important and something that should be looked at, Chief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5206.239s">Well,</a> I think it's in, she mentioned the Medford Square, but I think it's in all the business districts that it's difficult on the fringes I'm talking, not in the heart, but in the fringes of the business districts to see where it stops.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5249.662s">And</a> just my last point, and I mentioned it last week, chief, but it's a major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5253.845s">It</a> was an issue that was brought up five years ago when our committee that we sat on, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5257.868s">about</a> having citywide resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5262.251s">And</a> with this enforcement, like you mentioned, you're going to see people start to go into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5267.315s">And</a> those streets that don't have permit parking, that abut business districts, are going to take a brunt of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5274.24s">And</a> there's not going to be any enforcement on those streets, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5277.383s">And</a> to have a permit, when I go and get a permit, and my permit as a resident of Method, a taxpayer, that's only good for my street, is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5287.76s">I</a> should be able to park on any street in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5290.921s">We</a> should have one resident permit parking that covers all residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5294.862s">It</a> should be issued free every year to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5297.983s">The</a> $10 charge is, to me, a charge that we could forego. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5303.864s">And</a> every resident should get a resident permit parking sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5308.506s">And</a> then we can keep out, because I think the issue is that we're seeing people from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5313.787s">I</a> live near the Orange Line, so my street's filled up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5316.568s">I</a> don't live on a resident <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5317.65s">permit</a> parking street, every morning it fills up with commuters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5321.312s">I</a> can see them coming in, I see them with their briefcase, I wave to them, and they're off for 8 to 10 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5327.235s">Now,</a> Chief, that should be consistent throughout our whole community, and that would cut it all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5332.458s">It</a> would cut all those people that are coming into our community, parking on our side roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5336.541s">It'll</a> cut out all those people that are going to the business district and saying, I don't want to pay 50 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5341.022s">let</a> me go up two streets and I can park there for several hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5344.664s">It</a> really needs to be looked at now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5346.324s">And</a> I know you said we're going to look at it down the line, but that should have been looked at five years ago.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5456.887s">Because</a> the system allowed that for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5459.808s">I</a> might live next to a street that has resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5463.139s">I</a> can't park on this street, but they can park on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5465.741s">So</a> it became territorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5467.503s">If</a> you do it citywide, chief, everyone parks where they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5470.385s">And</a> I realize there's going to be problem spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5472.186s">You</a> know, there's going to be certain streets that maybe residents want to park on so they can jump on the T. And those are the things we're going to have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5479.228s">But</a> this needs to be done citywide.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5498.044s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to say, and Councilor Penta said it correctly, that I appreciate the Chief coming up here so far every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5507.576s">Um,</a> he, he's been forthcoming with his answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5511.258s">If</a> he doesn't have an answer, he, he researches it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5514.24s">Uh,</a> he's been the face of parking enforcement, whether you like it or not, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5518.643s">And,</a> uh, you know, and I appreciate that chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5521.404s">And</a> this was a large endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5523.786s">Uh,</a> the city for years stuck its head, its head in the sand and didn't want to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5528.308s">And,</a> uh, it would have been nice to have the mayor present his proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5532.851s">This</a> is his baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5533.871s">He</a> should have presented it, but you're up here presenting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5537.238s">And</a> I appreciate that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5538.478s">But</a> it would also be nice to hear from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5542.999s">I</a> mean, his sign says, leadership that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5546.02s">But</a> it only works when the heat's not on, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=5548.54s">Because</a> when the heat's on, he's nowhere to be found.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11344.333s">I</a> disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11345.194s">I</a> think we need to discuss this every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11347.735s">And</a> point of fact is that — Mr. President, a week ago, there was a surcharge of $3 for resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11359.461s">The</a> gentleman went back to his higher-ups. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11361.362s">He</a> met with the administration, and now there's no $3 surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11364.783s">That</a> was a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11366.224s">We</a> had residents that came up here that had concerns about parking in front of their building and so forth, and the chief has been addressing them one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11372.957s">We've</a> had concerns about kiosks in front of residential homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11376.071s">Those</a> have been addressed one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11377.931s">So,</a> you know, in my opinion, you can send the mayor an email, good luck getting a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11382.272s">You</a> can call his office three dozen times like residents have told me with no response. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11386.913s">I</a> would prefer, this is the only open public forum in this city, and this is where we're currently getting action. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11393.414s">We're</a> seeing results. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11395.054s">Why</a> should we say let's meet in two months from now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11397.554s">We're</a> seeing results, and this is such a fluid process that we've all spoke about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11402.575s">Why</a> should we wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11403.795s">Week</a> after week, if no one comes out next week, then we don't discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11407.456s">But</a> it should be an option where residents can come up every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11410.658s">It's</a> the only forum to allow them to speak, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11413.88s">So</a> I wholeheartedly support having this here in a weekly fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11418.123s">If</a> it's three weeks, four weeks, five months, five years, as long as we keep this forum open for the people, we're doing our job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11426.009s">And</a> I'm going to stick by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11428.27s">So</a> I would say that I would like to see a continuation of this next week, Mr. President, and have it on the agenda as an open item. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11435.58s">when</a> people can come up and discuss this at any time, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11847.276s">To</a> that end that Councilor Mike was just talking about, I agree that residents should speak first, but I would also say that when residents are at the podium, members of the council should pay attention <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11860.388s">They</a> shouldn't be working the audience, walking around glad handing, which happens a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11864.709s">I'm</a> not going to point at anyone in particular, but some members sit behind here and we listen diligently and other members are working the crowd trying to get votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11874.39s">So</a> in one aspect we're saying we want to be kind to the residents and listen to what they have to say, but when they get up to the podium, some members of this council could give a damn what the residents have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11885.072s">And</a> I think that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11886.172s">And</a> I've noticed that more and more now and I take exception to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11890.034s">And</a> I would hope there's a change by this council that when people are at the podium, we give them the respect they deserve and we sit and listen and not traverse the whole building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11900.663s">Because</a> to me, that's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11903.965s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Parker.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12560.172s">So</a> noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12560.512s">Councilor</a> Mark's point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12562.993s">So</a> why do we need this in the form of a resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12565.573s">The</a> city clerk couldn't get you that information from June of last year?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12573.184s">I</a> mean, you could have reached out and found out cause you're asking and hit the city clerk provide the consulate a listing of appointments on the council purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12580.43s">I</a> mean, he could probably provide that in 10 minutes.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12990.086s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12991.307s">I</a> had a call from a resident of the Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12994.655s">And</a> she wrote a letter to the owners of that particular business area where the stop and shop is on Salem Street and was told, her concern was regarding the condition of the lot out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13011.405s">It's</a> in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13014.187s">It's</a> a blighted area, that particular lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13018.449s">And</a> she was told by the business owner that they are going to be repaving <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13024.003s">that</a> whole particular lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13025.844s">And</a> she mentioned to the owner, is it possible to plant some shrubs and bushes and something to spruce up the area? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13034.807s">And</a> at that point, they said they had no plans to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13039.909s">So</a> at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that this council send a letter to the property owner of the stop and shop and that parcel of stores there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13051.552s">asking</a> that when the lot get repaved, that pavers go around the perimeter of the lot, that shrubs be planted, some small fruit trees, anything to spruce up that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13065.159s">There's</a> an 18-wheeler that parks in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13067.46s">There's</a> a giant tow truck that parks at the corner over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13070.661s">And</a> it's the gateway from Malden and that area to come into Method, and it's really an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13076.751s">Across</a> the street, you have a Chinese food restaurant that had a fire, I think it was about a year ago, and it's still boarded up with big action signs all over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13087.196s">It</a> really looks like an area that's downtrodden and hasn't had any attention in a long time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13095.621s">And</a> residents of that particular area are very upset with the lack of attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13101.384s">And</a> I'm hoping that a letter from this council <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13103.958s">will</a> at least help spruce up the stop and shopping area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13107.3s">And</a> maybe we can get the office of community development rather than build a peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13113.504s">That's</a> unnecessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13114.804s">In</a> my opinion, at a million three to go into our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13119.607s">and</a> look at the awnings, and look at the businesses that have been out of business for a year because of a fire, and see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13127.07s">See</a> what's happening on Forest Street, the business on Forest Street that's been vacant for years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13132.972s">The</a> Office of Community Development should be providing incentives for businesses to come into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13138.274s">The</a> ones that are already here should be providing incentives to stay here and do business, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13143.595s">And</a> in my opinion, an office that's manned with one and a half persons <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13148.057s">It's</a> inadequate in a city this size, and it's evident in every business district in this community with the lack of attention and the lack of development in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13158.542s">And</a> it comes from the corner office on down to the department head, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13163.345s">And</a> it's a shame when you have a department that does absolutely nothing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13169.028s">And</a> I'll say it when Lauren DiLorenzo pop is up here too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13172.61s">That</a> office does absolutely nothing to move this community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13176.812s">They've</a> been working on the revitalization of Medford Square three master plans later, 25 years later, and this administration is still talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13185.657s">the</a> master plan in Medford Square, the pearl necklace around the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13189.979s">He's</a> still talking about a water taxi. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13191.98s">That</a> makes no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13193.98s">But</a> when he goes into the business districts, he doesn't see the vacant storefronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13197.762s">He</a> doesn't see the trash strewn throughout the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13201.003s">He</a> doesn't see any of that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13203.264s">It's</a> amazing the blinders that this administration has on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13207.606s">And</a> it's time for a change.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13279.988s">The</a> city's doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13281.629s">I'm</a> sure we're not.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13293.511s">Good</a> point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13293.971s">What</a> about the clean it or lean it ordinance that was enacted some years ago by then representative Paul Donato? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13301.601s">How</a> can you have an establishment there two years with action signs? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13305.784s">What</a> does that do for the surrounding businesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13307.525s">Would</a> you like to own a restaurant, like the Italian restaurant that's a few doors down next to this particular place? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13314.489s">God</a> knows what's inside that place after two years of being vacant.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13324.856s">Does</a> the mayor ever drive by these areas? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13330.055s">Really,</a> does he ever drive by and see what's going on in this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13333.407s">I</a> don't understand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13334.928s">Residents</a> have to make calls, personal calls and e-mails to business owners to ask them to do stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13340.032s">And</a> the business owners say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13341.472s">The</a> city has never reached out to us once since we've been here.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14007.641s">I</a> find another Mr. President, uh, paper 15-zero zero two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14013.142s">It</a> is the nomination of the vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14016.675s">And</a> midway through it says six in the affirmative for Frederick N. Dello Russo Jr., the president of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14023.779s">On</a> the vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14028.522s">So</a> I'm both president and vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14030.243s">And</a> vice, according to the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14033.665s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14035.186s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14060.424s">Councilor</a> Camuso?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ/2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ.html">Medford City Council - January 6, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2671.28s">Just</a> before we get started, Mr. President, it would have been, in my opinion, helpful to have a public hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2678.437s">prior</a> to any negotiations, prior to any contact with the potential outside firm that's taking over parking management. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2688.623s">It</a> would have been helpful to have businesses, residents at the table before change could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2697.207s">And</a> now we're at a point where the program's starting and we want to hear from residents and we want to hear from business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2704.551s">And</a> I just think this process has been <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2707.023s">backwards,</a> to be quite honest with you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2718.403s">And</a> I'm hoping that Chief Sackler's here tonight, and there's two gentlemen from Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2723.866s">But</a> I'm hoping some of what takes place tonight, the comments that we hear, doesn't fall on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2731.069s">Because</a> as we've seen just over the last couple of weeks, that the administration has made several major changes to his pay for parking proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2742.498s">based</a> on input, which should have been had months and months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2746.779s">So,</a> you know, I, it's great that residents are coming up, but I hope that whatever stated that the mayor really takes into consideration and, uh, uh, if need be sit back down with Republican, the chief, uh, and I and out some of these major concerns we still exist was the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2764.382s">And</a> I thank you for giving me that opportunity.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4670.995s">I</a> think the issue is that when we had the public hearing back in 2009 it was to get input on eventually trying to create a parking management program in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4681.871s">What</a> people are asking now is there's been no and the mayor's pay for parking plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4687.593s">So</a> there's been no public hearing chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4689.533s">I</a> mean, you could talk about a second meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4692.014s">That</a> meeting wasn't regarding the mayor's plan that was being laid out chief at the time, if you recall.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5370.596s">I</a> just want to make sure that Councilor Camuso just outlined the process since 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5376.179s">But</a> maybe just unintentionally, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5379.598s">Between</a> 2009 and today, the mayor appointed another committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5384.721s">Oh,</a> yeah, City Hall employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5385.722s">Well,</a> that hasn't been mentioned at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5388.604s">Well,</a> because it's his ball, I say. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5389.604s">Well,</a> I'm just saying, the mayor appointed another committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5392.786s">That</a> committee consisted of all his department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5395.468s">We</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5396.249s">So</a> not one person, I didn't sit on the committee, Gwen didn't sit on the committee, Ron DeFranco didn't sit on the committee, Anthony Santoro didn't sit on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5405.415s">These</a> were department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5407.196s">And</a> the mayor devised a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5409.717s">So</a> I don't think it's accurate to sit back and say, based on recommendations that were made five years ago, that this is how the mayor went forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5418.403s">Because</a> that's not what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5420.144s">The</a> mayor went forward working in a vacuum in his office with his department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5425.588s">with</a> no input from anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5427.369s">And</a> that's what we're seeing here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5428.45s">I</a> think I stated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5429.25s">Well,</a> you might have stated that, but you've been supporting this from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5431.651s">Now,</a> all of a sudden, you're giving it a change of heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5433.512s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5434.012s">Councilor,</a> it's not a recommendation to bring leaders in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5435.413s">You've</a> got a crowd up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5436.094s">You've</a> got to change your heart now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5443.718s">Clarification</a> is our issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5445.118s">Just</a> if I could point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5446.459s">The</a> two major issues with this is that when we as a committee met, and Gwen can speak for herself, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5454.523s">When</a> we discussed about who was gonna do the enforcement, every discussion was in-house personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5461.545s">It</a> was our crossing guards, it was retired police. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5465.146s">The</a> mayor took the proposal and outsourced 95% of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5468.987s">So</a> that's a major part that the mayor changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5472.287s">Major</a> part. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5473.408s">Just</a> my other point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5475.685s">The</a> other point, as the Chief mentioned, and Ron DeFranco, who's on the committee, also mentioned, and Gwen mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5480.807s">Ron</a> DeFranco was not on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5482.107s">Yes,</a> he was on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5483.048s">He</a> was an ex-officio member. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5484.168s">He</a> was on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5485.189s">You</a> didn't attend any of the meetings, so don't talk like you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5487.309s">You're</a> the one that brought the meetings to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5489.01s">Don't</a> talk like you've been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5490.15s">If</a> we could make this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5491.471s">If</a> I could, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5493.612s">And</a> the second big issue, one was the outsourcing, and the second was that we as a committee wanted steady enforcement, parking enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5502.835s">with</a> the existing signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5504.615s">The</a> mayor took that around, wrapped it around, and made it a pay for parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5509.917s">So</a> the two major components were thought up in the mayor's committee with his department heads and had nothing to do with our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5518.619s">And</a> we have a committee member that was here tonight that can attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5522.7s">And</a> Ron DeFranco mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5524.34s">So</a> I don't like the fact that the mayor is looking now for a scapegoat to blame anyone on this parking when he should look in the mirror and he can see himself, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5560.32s">We</a> didn't have- I didn't support this language.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6642.994s">I</a> think if you were to put an hour, you would be defeated. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6648.078s">Oh,</a> for two hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6648.859s">Up</a> to the two hours, but that's my understanding.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6735.896s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6736.276s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6736.677s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6788.043s">Mr.</a> President, just if I could ask one question, because it's online that was just mentioned by Mr. Skelton. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6794.964s">And</a> I realize these people have been waiting, but while Mr. Skelton is here, it's an important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6801.845s">And</a> I would agree the people should speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6805.746s">You</a> just mentioned about a validation program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6808.987s">That's</a> a brand new aspect to this program I've never heard of before. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6813.127s">And</a> the way it was explained to me is what was just mentioned by the Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6817.635s">You're</a> going to allow business owners to reach out to Republic and say, these five plate numbers on Tuesday are going to be here for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6828.64s">Don't</a> tag them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6830.18s">They're</a> going to have to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6831.681s">Someone's</a> going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6832.281s">The</a> business is going to pay, whatever it is, for that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6835.743s">But</a> don't tag them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6837.083s">So</a> if you have any business that reaches out to you under this current program, I own a convenience store. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6843.286s">And</a> I tell you, there are going to be these three plates parked <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6846.849s">extended</a> period of time near my business. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6851.411s">You're</a> going to allow them to stay three, four, five, six, seven hours in that spot without getting a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6858.735s">They're</a> going to pay, but as long as they get the validation, is that, is that how this program works?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6904.526s">So</a> that hasn't been worked out yet.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6907.829s">So</a> we're moving forward in a couple of weeks and it seems like a lot of details haven't been worked out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6914.015s">My</a> concern with that is that if, you know, it might be good for one or two people in the course of a day, but if you have 45 people reserving spots on our streets, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6923.417s">As</a> you just mentioned, the refeeding of a meter defeats the purpose of the whole program of moving cars along. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6929.76s">And</a> I can sympathize if someone needs to be in a business for over two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6933.583s">However,</a> I'm not sure how you're going to manage that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6936.784s">And</a> to have this program, the validation program, just brought up at the last minute, I don't think is a good program, especially where there's no consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6947.21s">There's</a> no policy from what you're telling me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6950.151s">I</a> doubt the city has a policy on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6953.417s">And</a> I'm not sure if that's something that should be implemented right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6957.46s">And</a> I know the mayor is trying to appease anyone that makes a phone call to him, but I'm not quite sure that's in the best interest of our city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6966.285s">And</a> it may not be a question to you, but I'm very concerned about that program because potentially anyone can give you seven plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6975.331s">Any</a> business owner can call and give you seven plate numbers and say, please don't touch these Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6981.123s">I</a> mean, I don't see what would prevent that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6983.886s">And</a> before you know it, there's going to be no on-street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6987.349s">Everything's</a> going to be saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6989.451s">Really,</a> when you boil down to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6991.573s">And</a> it would be worthwhile to pay $0.25 for every 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6997.059s">It'd</a> be a bargain. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6998.781s">Actually,</a> you may even get people that <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7000.493s">park</a> there all day, and take the bus into town for $4 or $5, whatever it costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7006.575s">I</a> mean, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7007.315s">And</a> I might be stating it very simply, but there's a huge concern with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7014.037s">And</a> I think that was a knee-jerk reaction by this administration to try to help out a few people, all in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7020.8s">But</a> I don't know how that's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7023.04s">And</a> I would recommend that that doesn't move forward.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7052.01s">And</a> so was raising the fee to $400 discussed and that was raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7057.177s">I</a> mean, there's a lot of discussion going on and no one knows what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7061.821s">And</a> that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7063.022s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7063.503s">And</a> I'm not blaming you too, but there's a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7066.666s">And</a> these are the reasons why we should have had 10 public hearings prior to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7071.03s">And</a> from what we see, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7073.452s">There's</a> always going to be work in progress, but this is only about 40% in completion, in my opinion, chief, at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7080.121s">And</a> I don't know how we have a go-live date, which doesn't make any sense.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7136.7s">Where</a> is that policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7137.16s">Where</a> is that written, Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7139.3s">Where</a> is that written? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7141.681s">It</a> must be a policy, a guideline. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7144.361s">Where</a> is that written, the validation policy?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7150.663s">That's</a> what I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7151.443s">Where</a> is this stuff?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7157.024s">No,</a> but Chief, God forbid something happens to you tomorrow, who's going to have this information in their head?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7165.428s">If</a> it says two hour limit, I know, but business owners are walking around now telling people that they can get validation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7171.409s">And</a> it wasn't an hour that I heard from business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7174.01s">So</a> they thought they can get more than an hour, just so you know.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7198.047s">There's</a> a lot of reasons, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7200.327s">There's</a> a lot of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=7201.908s">And</a> we should be in the business of saving spots.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8757.253s">What's</a> the margin of error?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8771.588s">And</a> they're going to determine if you're in that same spot, even though our spots currently aren't clearly marked, you're going to be able to tell if they're in that same exact spot.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11301.654s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11302.556s">Chief,</a> just if I could, we referred back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11306.385s">parking</a> committee in 2009, one of the recommendations was to have citywide permit parking, or at least to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11315.287s">And</a> that's part of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11317.168s">Has</a> there been any movement on reviewing citywide permit parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11320.949s">Because</a> the approach of having it done piecemeal right now is not adequate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11327.55s">Residents</a> are sending us emails stating the permit only is issued for your particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11334.019s">So</a> if you want to go visit your sister or your aunt or your cousin, still in Method, you can't take your resident permit parking sticker and go to another section of Method, which to me is ridiculous.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11424.744s">And</a> chief, and I think Gwen Blackburn, who's still here, can attest to the fact when we visited Malden, Everett, Somerville, Boston, the committee itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11436.095s">everyone</a> came back to us and said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11439.836s">Keep</a> whatever parking enforcement you do free from city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11444.177s">Don't</a> locate it at city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11445.757s">Keep</a> it away from city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11447.918s">And</a> we heard that over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11450.499s">And</a> what we did was create an enforcement office on main street, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11454.98s">That's</a> free from city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11456.8s">But</a> the mayor outsourced everything other than the hearings, the appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11462.862s">The</a> one thing you'd say, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11464.409s">We</a> don't want to be involved with the appeal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11467.251s">The</a> mayor kept that in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11469.172s">He</a> not only kept it in-house, he kept it here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11473.735s">So</a> it flies in the face of everything that we heard in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11479.358s">And</a> then the mayor took it one step further and said that he didn't believe with this new enforcement program that there was going to be an increase that would merit or warrant someone, because we only have a part-time person that does the hearings now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11494.325s">and</a> he didn't believe, with all this new ticketing, that we would need someone to do hearings, which makes no sense at all to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11503.607s">Absolutely</a> no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11505.128s">So</a> the two points is, leaving it out of city hall, he kept it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11509.549s">The</a> other point is, you have a part-time person, Diane McLeod, who works full-time at a real job, and does this on a part-time, and now she's gonna be asked to do a program that, there was no enforcement in the city, very little, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11524.298s">to</a> now full-blown enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11526.159s">I</a> just don't see it happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11527.779s">We</a> asked that money be put in the budget to pay for another hearing officer, and the mayor denied it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11533.902s">So</a> I still don't know how that's going to work, Chief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11576.623s">But</a> Chief, think about all the different policies that haven't been outlined yet, all the different appeals that people are going to come up with and say, you know what, you told me this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11584.886s">That</a> person is going to be inundated with hearings.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11616.871s">The</a> President And if we see compliance, Republicans are going to be in a lot of trouble because they're not going to get their revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11622.542s">Their</a> revenue is not based on feeding the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11625.023s">It's</a> based on ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11625.863s">In</a> life, there's risk, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11626.963s">Two-thirds</a> of their revenue is based on ticketing, not meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11631.385s">So</a> if compliance is there, and I hope that's correct, they're going to be out of business very shortly.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11641.848s">Yeah,</a> but they hide behind bushes, Chief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12334.439s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12337.481s">So</a> are you saying the may is in violation of the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12341.483s">That's</a> what you just stated.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_QuIJp-vSiqo/2025-03-21_QuIJp-vSiqo.html">Medford City Council - December 23, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1071.923s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1073.865s">During</a> the site plan review, probably two months back, there was a recommendation, one of several recommendations, to alter the drive-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1084.033s">Can</a> you just point out on the plan what exactly was altered for the drive-through?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1133.497s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1134.197s">Um,</a> also, um, the, uh, filtration system, uh, as a Panera or yourself agreed to, uh, we mentioned at the last, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1147.341s">Smashburger</a> that was a charcoal filtration system, but I'm being told there are other type of filtration systems that may best suit this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1155.628s">So</a> I just want to go on record that yourself open era will provide the filtration system.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1193.59s">So</a> we'll have a charcoal filter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1195.35s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1195.61s">And</a> the other point I had was from neighbors in the area regarding no parking in front of the establishment on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1204.721s">I</a> realize that's under the city jurisdiction, but I just want you, as the owner of the property, representing the owner of the property, that I, as a member of the council, I'm sure other members agree, that we're gonna push so that there is no parking along the curb on Riverside Ave.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1255.352s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1255.672s">It</a> would only be on the retail side in front of the establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1261.025s">And</a> also, uh, during site plan review, one of the recommendations was the exit out of your lot, uh, that there would be signage, which I believe, uh, uh, I see in the plan here, but I only see one sign unless that's just pointing to two separate areas where it says you have to exit, take a right onto commercial street rather than go back to the congested way of getting out onto Riverside Ave.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1289.19s">Can</a> you point to where those signs are located?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1325.063s">And</a> did you have to have any discussion with Ocean State Job Lot relative to using that's their access driveway, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1332.227s">We</a> did.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1460.241s">So</a> if need be, at some point, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1463.383s">Can</a> we have it so that cars have to exit coming out of your lot out to the commercial street area through means of barriers or some type of? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1476.705s">I'm</a> not asking you to make a definitive now, but if the traffic, as we all anticipate, is going to increase, which we hope it does with these three businesses, that at some point maybe to help alleviate some of the concerns we have <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1492.172s">with</a> the queuing up, exiting onto Riverside Ave, that may be an alternative.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1608.613s">And</a> just one last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1611.055s">You</a> mentioned at a recent meeting that you were going to also do sidewalks on the opposite side of Riverside Ave to improve pedestrian safety.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1695.176s">Did</a> you say linkage money?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1702.688s">So</a> do you know what the actual linkage fees are?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1734.496s">Oh,</a> by far, but not many communities have linkage, and it's an extra additive when companies come in and do work up to a certain size. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1746.744s">So</a> it's a benefit to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1749.226s">Mr.</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1750.842s">You</a> know, the neighbors had many concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1753.063s">The</a> petitioner was good enough to sit down at a meeting with the neighbors a couple of weeks ago when we had that monsoon rainstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1763.646s">Also,</a> during the site plan review, there was a number of questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1768.027s">I</a> know this is not going to be a perfect situation relative to the traffic impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1774.769s">We've</a> had discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1776.329s">Hopefully,</a> someday we'll be able to sit down with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1779.27s">In</a> my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1780.383s">The</a> Fells Plaza, you should be able to exit the Fells Plaza on the Fellsway and also be able to cross over the Fellsway and go east, like you go into Haines Square up the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1791.087s">That</a> would alleviate all of Riverside Ave or a lot of the traffic on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1795.869s">Unfortunately,</a> right now, when you come out of the Fellsway, you have to take a right onto the Fellsway and go into Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1801.848s">And</a> for many people in that particular area, that doesn't suit their need when they're coming out of stop and shop or, or, you know, a business establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1808.83s">So,</a> uh, I will support this here tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1812.091s">I</a> think it's an addition, uh, to, uh, the neighborhood and something that we have to monitor for overall, uh, traffic impact and pedestrian safety in the area, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1825.015s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2482.09s">Before</a> the roll is called, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2483.73s">If</a> the petitioner wouldn't mind, at a meeting a few weeks ago, I had brought up the issue about these metal drop-off containers that are located in many businesses throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2496.754s">I</a> know the Fells Plaza has several, and I'm not sure if your property extends all the way to Aldi's, but directly across from Aldi's, there's a couple of metal containers <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2508.942s">I</a> believe are for books or something, but at any given day, if you go out there, there's old computers, broken TVs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2515.488s">It's</a> really becoming an eyesore, and there's neighbors directly across the street.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2553.214s">The</a> President And you said CHEMCO?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2555.735s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2559.597s">The</a> President Well, I would ask, Mr. President, as a B paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2563.175s">The</a> council will send a letter to the property owners, Kimco, to respond to the metal containers that are on their property and what their plans are to maintain these particular containers, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5080.138s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5081.198s">I</a> appreciate the chief being up here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5084.62s">I</a> served on the committee with the chief and, uh, I can tell you, uh, as one member on the committee back, uh, that was appointed by the mayor back in 2000 and, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5093.735s">eight</a> is that our mission was to take a look at how other communities operate, uh, their parking enforcement and to, uh, secondly, see if parking enforcement was necessary in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5107.461s">And</a> overwhelmingly, if anyone read the report that was issued back in September, 2009, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5113.378s">The</a> issue was the fact that we were doing very little parking enforcement, and our major number one issue was to provide consistent in-house parking enforcement citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5126.641s">That</a> was our number one objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5128.741s">And</a> it was to not outsource, but to have, as was mentioned earlier, maybe crossing guards, retired police officers, civilians go out there and do the ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5140.304s">I</a> think what we're experiencing now, Chief, and this is really no reflection on you, is that we're looking at surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5147.328s">For</a> instance, we hear Somerville mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5149.63s">Somerville</a> has had a parking program in effect for almost 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5154.873s">And</a> as you mentioned, they've improved upon their parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5158.895s">And</a> they're very aggressive in some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5160.817s">And</a> by no means do I think method should be that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5163.8s">But</a> I do believe we should have started off with baby steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5167.424s">We</a> should have done some consistent enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5170.728s">Look</a> at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5171.689s">A</a> year later, say maybe we can introduce pay for parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5177.495s">Maybe</a> at some point we'll look at city-wide permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5180.74s">Maybe</a> at some point we'll look about taking it in-house and outsourcing certain aspects of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5186.727s">I</a> think we could have looked at this rather than all of a sudden go for a Cadillac approach from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5194.037s">You</a> know, when the program was first mentioned, there was a lot of talk by this council saying, you know what, whatever happens, there has to be a good four or five-week grace period where they give out fake tickets and residents are aware of what's going on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5210.12s">And</a> now I read from the administration, the ambassador program in the districts one week prior to implementation to guide consumers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5219.866s">So</a> one week prior to the middle of January, when this is supposed to start, there are going to be some ambassadors with red coats and badges, I guess, walking around our business districts, introducing people in their busy life to the kiosk and how to operate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5236.178s">but</a> I don't find anywhere in the mayor's proposal where it says there'll be a grace period. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5241.041s">And</a> I think I speak for all my council members that that was a key issue in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5246.946s">Uh,</a> you know, if we're going to move forward on this program, uh, I think that's vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5251.409s">And,</a> um, you know, it was mentioned that, um, you know, this is new territory and it is new territory. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5258.654s">And</a> I agree with some of the speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5260.768s">because</a> we haven't had the public input like we should have had in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5266.011s">And</a> I'm not just talking about business owners, I'm talking about residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5269.633s">We've</a> been hearing from business owners the last several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5273.135s">Wait</a> till the residents find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5275.557s">Wait</a> till the residents who are going to the corner store to get a newspaper find out they have to feed a kiosk and put their plate in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5283.161s">And</a> if they put the wrong plate number, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5285.375s">It</a> doesn't spit it out, right, Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5287.196s">If</a> I plug in a wrong digit on my plate number... It's not going to know what your plate number is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5290.979s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5291.199s">It's</a> up to you to put the right number in. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5292.2s">I'm</a> going to get a ticket thinking I did the right thing, and then I'm going to have to appeal the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5296.903s">And</a> just my last point, because I've talked ad nauseum on this subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5301.026s">You</a> know, the one part of this program that you'd say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5306.57s">We</a> don't want any politics involved in this because every city we went to, they said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5311.695s">Keep</a> this free from city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5313.657s">Make</a> it a standalone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5315.158s">Don't</a> have any involvement with city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5317.981s">We</a> outsourced every part of this program except for the hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5324.508s">The</a> mayor's administrator will take care of the hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5329.986s">The</a> one aspect you'd say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5331.748s">We</a> don't want any involvement in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5333.869s">That's</a> the one aspect the mayor kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5335.911s">And</a> during budget time, we said, Mr. Mayor, you're going to go from 20 tickets a year to 2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5341.656s">Do</a> you still think that administrator who has several other roles in the city is going to be able to keep up with all the demand and increase for public hearings? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5352.845s">We</a> asked that an additional part-time person be on to take care of the hearings, and the mayor denied that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5359.095s">The</a> mayor said he didn't believe that there'd be an additional increase in the need for hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5365.058s">I</a> think that's false. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5366.658s">I</a> think there's going to be a big need. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5368.899s">I</a> think people are going to be outraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5371.46s">Honestly,</a> chief, even though we're going to have a picture of their plate when the car drives by, takes a picture of the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5377.995s">But</a> you could be pulled over for a number of different reasons on the roadside. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5382.398s">And</a> I think it's going to increase the hearings tenfold in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5386.241s">And</a> honestly, I don't think the city's quite ready for a full-fledged enforcement program that involves kiosks on the roads, that involves an outside company that's going to be very aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5399.511s">I</a> heard at the meetings that the chamber had, and I appreciate they had that, but the gentleman there was saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5405.33s">We're</a> going to work with the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5406.751s">We're</a> going to make sure this is going to be so laid back and so easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5411.593s">And</a> then his henchmen, who was three feet from him, that didn't open his mouth, was counting the dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5418.617s">Because</a> they're going to be very aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5421.178s">You</a> better bet your bottom dollar, their revenue is based on what they take in.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5439.414s">Money</a> talks, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5441.194s">Money</a> talks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5441.655s">When</a> they have their operation, they hire the employees, they put up that money that was fronted for the kiosk is on Republic, the employees, their health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5451.657s">And</a> once the cost gets established and once residents and business owners know that there's going to be ticketing out there, in my opinion, people are going to <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5462.417s">stay</a> away from the areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5464.157s">And</a> then revenue is going to go down, Chief, and it's going to be a self-fulfilling process. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5468.119s">And</a> they're going to be out there hiding behind barrels, looking to get money any way they can to comply with the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5476.121s">So</a> I disagree with you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5478.201s">If</a> it was in-house, we can control it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5480.202s">We</a> could say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5481.392s">let's</a> not do this, let's not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5483.212s">Once</a> you outsource, especially in a 10 year contract, you're at their mercy, chief, you're at their mercy.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5644.189s">I</a> haven't seen that in the mayor's proposal, but if you say it's in there.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5651.384s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5651.885s">And</a> just to get back, if you look at the contract that was signed, two thirds of the revenue is derived from tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5659.962s">The</a> actually paying on the meters is just a secondary thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5664.005s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5664.786s">It's</a> a secondary thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5666.127s">The</a> lion's share of their revenue is going to be by ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5669.189s">And</a> the only way they're going to get that lion's share of the revenue is to be aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5673.253s">They</a> don't care if you go up and pay a quarter, run the store, and come back out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5676.995s">That</a> has no bearing on them at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5679.017s">They're</a> in the business of issuing tickets, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5681.879s">They're</a> in the business of issuing tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5683.46s">And</a> when I hear someone from the company say, oh, we're not going to work with everyone, don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5689.485s">That's</a> a red flag to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5691.306s">And</a> you know, I don't want to say it's going to happen, but you know, because I hope it doesn't chief, but let me tell you this, this is not what we bargained for.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5742.649s">Mr.</a> President, too, if we could just find out the money from the resident permit parking, business permit parking, and commuter resident permit parking, does that go into the general fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5757.213s">Or</a> does Republic get a cut on the money that's derived from that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5764.755s">I</a> guess there's the regular business permit parking, then there's resident commuter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5770.528s">permit</a> parking, and then there's regular permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5774.989s">But</a> that money, does Republic get a cut on whatever they bring in? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5780.29s">And</a> just my last point, I had a gentleman that sent me an email just this morning, and he was trying to get a resident permit parking sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5789.852s">He</a> went to the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5791.373s">He</a> was told to go to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5792.993s">He</a> had his $10 check in his hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5795.134s">At</a> City Hall, they <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5797.157s">handed</a> him a sheet of paper with a logo that said PAC method, and it said learn more about pay by phone, and he had to go back home to pay by phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5807.321s">And</a> there has to be better outreach, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5809.902s">We</a> use reverse 911 to notify residents when it's going to rain in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5817.035s">That's</a> how often we use it, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5818.436s">And</a> then we get bashed if we don't use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5820.016s">So</a> I don't know what to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5820.997s">But</a> the big issues, Chief, the big issues like this, no mention at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5825.358s">No</a> mention at all, reverse 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5826.819s">It</a> is coming.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7676.451s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7677.972s">Just</a> if I could, because the gentleman has a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7682.854s">And</a> since 2009, when the Parking Advisory Committee made their recommendations, to today, the mayor has created his own committee to work on parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7698.932s">And</a> that was members of him, his administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7702.935s">So</a> that's who devised this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7705.317s">This</a> was no one but the mayor and his department heads that put together this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7710.221s">If</a> you look at the parking enforcement advisory committee, this plan is apples and the mayor's plan is oranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7719.188s">Two</a> completely different plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7722.226s">completely</a> different plans, of which much of what you mentioned about local in-house enforcement and so forth was addressed in our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7732.513s">Just</a> bare bones enforcement of existing signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7736.575s">That</a> was in our current plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7739.057s">Over</a> the past four years, the mayor has, and he's the chief executive officer, so if you're looking for someone to make change to the plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7748.154s">You're</a> speaking to the wrong people. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7749.835s">We're</a> a legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7751.236s">We</a> open, uh, we have a public meeting, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7754.978s">Well,</a> just say we're a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7756.779s">People</a> can come up and speak, but if you want to affect change, it's the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7762.602s">And</a> we've tried, believe me, countless times to get the mayor to one of our meetings, uh, so he can speak before the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7769.186s">But</a> the mayor under the city charter is not required to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7773.068s">So</a> I've been on the council 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7774.849s">He</a> has never come before the podium in 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7777.637s">But</a> that's his prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7779.939s">But</a> my suggestion is that if people are upset, they should contact the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7786.384s">When</a> I voted for allowing the mayor, because state law said he can only enter into a contract up to three years, the three bids that came back were all for 10 years, or seven, or 10, I forget what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7798.054s">They</a> were all past the three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7800.076s">My</a> vote was to allow him to enter into a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7803.298s">The</a> language in the contract is the mayor's. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7806.998s">I</a> would not have support much of the language that was in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7811.443s">Did</a> anyone behind this reel vote to raise the business permit packet from $100 to $400? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7817.168s">Did</a> anyone vote to bring Republic or a private outside company to come in and do the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7823.255s">We</a> did not vote on any portion of this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7827.033s">So</a> when people say to the council, we did not vote on any part of this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7831.774s">This</a> is the mayor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7833.995s">And</a> I hope it works well for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7835.795s">But</a> from what I'm hearing from the residents, they wish there was more input. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7839.536s">They</a> wish there was a time that we had that we could sit down and iron over some of the issues.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8827.498s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8829.198s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8830.419s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8832.363s">Yes,</a> indeed, the maintenance issue was one concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8836.626s">Moving</a> forward on a project without a maintenance plan made no sense, and I'm glad we were able to table the paper to get a report back from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8848.914s">However,</a> as I stated, I believe it was last week, that I would support a modest <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8857.998s">plan</a> to memorialize the Marathon bombing victims. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8866.184s">I</a> see this Peace Garden as a great option on remembering, as a remembrance area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8877.852s">However,</a> in this day and age, especially in this economy, with all the many needs that we have in our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8887.666s">uh,</a> from street sidewalk repairs to a new police station, to an updated public library, uh, to, uh, the boys and girls club that has to close their art room because there's mold. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8902.498s">So</a> a hundred kids on a daily basis can't use the art room. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8906.602s">Uh,</a> we also spoke a couple of weeks ago about repurposing, which is 150 yards, uh, from this, uh, proposed site. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8916.011s">the</a> transportation shelter, um, uh, which, uh, would, uh, go hand in hand with, uh, in the proximity of, uh, this particular peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8927.116s">And,</a> um, I, at this point, um, I understand the fact that there was mentioned of no taxpayer dollars going into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8935.399s">Um,</a> however, uh, the Cummings grant, the, uh, wind resorts, 250,000, uh, even the park grant that we're voting on tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8945.958s">could</a> have been used for other purposes in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8950.179s">We</a> could have sought this funding for many other purposes in our community that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8956.441s">And</a> that's not to understate the need to memorialize the victims of that tragic incident that took place and many thousands of people that were impacted both mentally and physically by that occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8975.437s">I,</a> in all good faith, could not vote for the Peace Garden in this particular $299,000 park grant because it's my job to look in the community, see what the needs are, and try to address the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8996.354s">And</a> in my opinion, $1,298,000 on apostle land <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9001.202s">which</a> I've stated both at committee whole meetings and publicly, I don't believe that the intersection of Riverside and Shipway is the appropriate place to have, if we're going to put a Peace Garden, an area to reflect, a solemn area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9023.836s">That's</a> a very high traveled area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9026.658s">Just</a> last week, I was coming up to the city council meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9029.903s">And</a> someone drove up on the median strip right here on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9034.504s">We</a> take the turn to go to City Hall, take the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9037.645s">They</a> drove right up onto the road over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9040.866s">This</a> is a high-traveled area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9043.287s">And</a> in my opinion, I believe as a community, which was already mentioned, actually, there was behind the Columbus School, the softball field named after Krista Campbell, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9059.522s">And</a> I think, in my opinion, we could have done a tasteful memorial plaque somewhere in the community to recognize the victims of the Marathon bombing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9071.132s">And</a> if the administration would like to call back the 250,000 from Wynn Resorts and use it towards possibly the mold issue at the Boys and Girls Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9086.062s">Use</a> it towards improvements on our roads, the potholes that we're seeing throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9093.325s">Use</a> it towards the repurposing of the transportation shelter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9099.588s">I</a> have been inundated from that one article in the local paper about the transportation shelter with repurposes, repurpose uses from residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9110.794s">The</a> gentleman from the paper actually told me that he put it on his website <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9115.915s">and</a> also has received a number of people responding back. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9121.42s">And</a> I would like to see that also take some attention, Mr. President, which is in the heart of our downtown business district, before we move on $1,298,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9133.41s">So,</a> if the administration is willing to take the $250,000 from Wynn Resorts and apply it to other needs, I mentioned and other members of the council have, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9144.466s">I</a> could support this here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9146.307s">If</a> not, Mr. President, I will not support this park grant because I believe it should be spent on local existing parks currently in our community need updating. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9158.692s">I</a> know there's been some improvement throughout the city and parks, but as we know, we have, I believe it's 24 parks in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9165.855s">They</a> always need updating on the taut lots, uh, in the basketball courts and, uh, throughout the parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9173.551s">for</a> themselves, the ball fields, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9176.113s">So</a> that would be my motion tonight, Mr. President, to take the $250,000 out of this particular proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9183.679s">I'll</a> approve the $299,000 for the park grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9187.622s">And</a> I'm sure wind management, this is part of a million dollars they want to give the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9194.068s">Wind</a> resorts, I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9195.749s">This</a> is part of a million dollars they want to give the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9198.211s">I'm</a> sure they wouldn't mind where we spent the million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9201.413s">Any</a> community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9203.628s">My</a> motion is to take the $250,000, have the administration take that money back out of the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9212.662s">That</a> would mean lowering the proposal by $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9216.059s">You</a> know, we heard last week, I think it was Lungo-Koehn, that questioned the upkeep of the fountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9223.281s">I've</a> questioned the upkeep of the fountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9226.002s">I</a> believe Mrs. Pop mentioned that it was $250,000, roughly, the cost for the water fountain, the fountains that are going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9237.675s">So</a> I think if the administration wanted to move forward, we can remove the water fountain, we can remove the estimated roughly $3,000 in yearly outside costs to maintain the fountains, and move forward with a memorial that is what the mayor deems worthy, but on a smaller scale, and also be able to accomplish some of the many other needs we have in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9264.772s">So</a> that's what I would offer, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9267.351s">$250,000,</a> if the administration agrees upon it, be removed, the project be lowered by $250,000 with the removal of the fountains, and that money be repurposed back into the needs of the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9281.06s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9281.221s">Dillon.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9298.412s">Point</a> of information, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9299.532s">You</a> know, last week, I think it was Councilor Caraviello that asked the question, and we got a different answer last week, so that's fine.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9310.44s">You</a> can ask him to come up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9350.086s">So,</a> Mr. President, then, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9352.42s">uh,</a> whether it's a million or a million, 250,000, the fact of the matter is that money could be used for any purpose in the community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9381.56s">Mr.</a> President, just a point of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9384.982s">No</a> one said this money wasn't allocated for a particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9387.963s">I</a> know you applied for a grant for this particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9391.798s">What</a> I'm saying is, you could have applied for the PAC grant to improve renovations to other existing PACs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9398.624s">We</a> did apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9399.244s">We</a> have received. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9399.885s">I</a> know you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9400.405s">I</a> know you did.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9405.109s">And</a> what I'm saying is, with the $250,000, the mayor could have went and said, I want to spend it on X, Y, and Z. He opted to spend it on the Peace Guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9414.017s">That's</a> his prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9415.558s">So</a> I don't want people to believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9418.079s">When</a> resorts came to the mayor and said, we're only giving you $250 for the Peace Gardener, you get nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9423.222s">That</a> is not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9424.543s">That</a> is not the case.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9956.137s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9958.357s">Mr.</a> President, the picture that was taken back on October 27th of this year was with the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, and this was submitted to the paper as a press release from the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9976.242s">The</a> paper didn't write an article about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9978.703s">The</a> mayor submitted a press release stating Mayor McGlynn was pleased to accept $299,000 in grant funding.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9996.051s">Mr.</a> President, so the mayor wanted to come out in front of the issue and accept a check that wasn't approved by the grant <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10005.373s">by</a> the grant states approved by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10009.195s">It's</a> not the city council saying we want to approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10011.575s">The</a> grant is saying you can't accept funding until the city council approves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10016.097s">Now</a> we're almost near Christmas, and we're being asked to vote on the grant that the mayor accepted, offered a press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10024.26s">And,</a> you know, Mr. President, just if I could, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10029.282s">You</a> know, the mayor started working on this in April of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10032.563s">He</a> worked 11 months with him and whoever else in his office, didn't make any mention to anyone that he was moving forward on a project this size, didn't make any mention that he was trying to memorialize the victims of the bombing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10048.706s">And</a> in April of 2014, came out right around there, came out with his plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10056.508s">to</a> have a memorial across the street and the funding and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10060.451s">At</a> the time he mentioned he didn't let this out because he didn't have the funding yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10066.055s">So</a> he was looking, scurrying around to find money. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10069.037s">He</a> went to Wynn Resort, old faithful. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10072.68s">He</a> knows that the city has an agreement with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10075.855s">And</a> he asked them for money for this memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10079.118s">He</a> started looking for grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10081.401s">And</a> he was successful in finding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10083.363s">I</a> give him credit for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10084.964s">But</a> that doesn't mean that I'm on board because the mayor did all this work behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10090.069s">That</a> doesn't mean he's just going to get my buy-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10092.572s">Are</a> we going to have a memorial for the woman that was struck a couple of weeks ago on Winthrop Street?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10100.235s">Well,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10101.055s">It</a> was mentioned about tragedies and how we want to recognize one of our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10104.737s">There</a> are countless residents in this community that are struck and killed on our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10109.399s">Do</a> I hear an outcry of creating memorials throughout the community for residents that are killed on our streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10116.823s">I</a> don't, Mr. President, and no one's trying to belittle this or make this less of anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10122.668s">And</a> how dare people accuse other people of not being of higher authority or great morals because they don't support what the mayor put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10132.736s">That's</a> a smokescreen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10134.497s">And</a> if those people want to come out with their money, let them put their money where their mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10138.481s">These</a> business owners in the community, let them put their money where their mouth is and make large donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10145.146s">If</a> they're that concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10147.188s">Talk</a> is cheap, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10973.407s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10975.469s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10977.151s">Isn't</a> it ironic that <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10979.509s">An</a> hour ago, we were talking about parking enforcement in the community and the lack of communication from the administration and why we're experiencing the, um, concern from business owners and residents at this particular stage for parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10996.433s">And</a> here we are with a project that the mayor kept secret for 11 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11001.195s">No</a> communication with the council at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11003.873s">Now</a> he needs a vote, and everyone's questioning why we're asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11009.015s">Last</a> week, I made the mention about a maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11011.777s">I</a> was told, no, no, we need a vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11014.338s">We'll</a> get you the maintenance plan next week we're meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11016.479s">We'll</a> get you a vote next, we'll get the maintenance plan next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11020.821s">It's</a> amazing that all this surrounds the lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11026.363s">And,</a> you know, if members of the council over here feel, hey, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11030.175s">They're</a> going to get presented items, and they're just going to vote whatever the mayor presents. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11033.836s">That's</a> your prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11036.397s">But</a> I, if I ask questions or have concerns, I don't think anyone should take exception to other members asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11044.699s">I</a> really don't, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11046.28s">And</a> if it gets voted up, down, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11049.04s">I</a> go on to the next issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11051.401s">But</a> I feel strongly, as I said last week, that a modest memorial is the way to go in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11058.869s">a</a> modest memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=11061.672s">And</a> with the needs that we have and the needs that are out there in the community, as I mentioned, when you have people calling you up about<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as/2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as.html">Medford City Council - December 16, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1646.23s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1647.211s">And</a> I want to thank my Councilor colleague Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1652.803s">You</a> know, we hear the terminology, especially in this particular tax season, that we hear the words free cash all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1661.413s">And</a> I've had so many people stop me and say, where does the city get free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1665.919s">How</a> does that work? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1668.141s">And,</a> you know, when I explain to them that it's nothing more than the taxpayer's money, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1674.458s">You</a> know, all of a sudden, a light bulb goes off in their head, and they say, well, why isn't this coming back to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1679.92s">If</a> you have free cash laying around, why doesn't this filter back to the taxpayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1685.583s">And</a> the same can be said with free cash, as we're talking about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1689.064s">The</a> surplus in the water and sewer enterprise account, we all realize you need a rainy day fund to pay for projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1696.807s">For</a> instance, the big rainstorm, many residents were impacted with the flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1702.198s">But</a> to have excessive amounts of $6, $7, $8 million, in my opinion, and I think you're hearing it from some of the councilors, is about time that we finally go back to the taxpayer and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1715.507s">It's</a> time for an early Christmas gift this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1718.789s">And</a> it may seem like a small thing to save $45 for a single family or whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1725.807s">But</a> I think it speaks volumes to how this administration and how the city feels about the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1733.071s">And</a> at some point, we're going to be looking at having reserves that you're not going to be able to explain why they're so large. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1743.836s">And</a> I know you're going to disagree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1746.026s">But</a> we've seen an escalation since the new water meters of reserves that build up from deficits to now multi-million dollars in surpluses in the water and sewer account, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1758.491s">But</a> at what point do we stop building those reserves? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1762.573s">And</a> the way I see it is, you know, the city shouldn't have their hand in the taxpayer's pocket constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1769.582s">And</a> yes, we should provide ample services to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1773.404s">And</a> yes, we want to have a city that's moving forward, but to what extent? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1778.586s">And</a> I think that's the question that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1781.768s">And</a> we never hear any talk about new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1785.529s">We</a> never hear any talk about the revitalization of Method Square, which I may add has been under works by this administration for the past 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1799.162s">The</a> plan needs to be dusted off. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1802.344s">We</a> have three parcels of land in the downtown business district that's owned by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1809.027s">I</a> don't know many other communities that can brag about that, but we have that in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1814.489s">And</a> we're not taking advantage of these particular pieces of property that are being underutilized and can bring additional taxes in, and not from the beleaguered rate payer that's currently paying the bill right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1829.135s">You</a> know, we talked about surplus water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1832.256s">We</a> talked about free cash, cable franchise fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1836.157s">We</a> haven't had a community cable access station in almost two years, but we're all paying a franchise fee right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1844.259s">The</a> mayor has hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in an account with the earmark to provide local community access, and it's not currently being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1854.664s">Does</a> every franchise payer out there that's paying their franchise fee on their cable bill, whether you have Verizon or Comcast, do they deserve a break from this fee that's not being used for its purpose? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1866.776s">I</a> believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1868.337s">So</a> I would support this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1871.627s">I</a> think the million dollars will leave the surplus well primed to pay for anything that comes up, any emergencies or anything that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1885.072s">And</a> I think it sends a message to the taxpayers of this community that, yes, if there are surpluses, you too will benefit in the surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1895.915s">And</a> after all, it's your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1898.832s">I</a> will support this tonight, and I thank my colleague for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1902.613s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5362.993s">So</a> from what Mr. O'Neill just mentioned, what would it take to create a new classification with the Department of Revenue?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5404.5s">Do</a> you know if other states have that classification?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6146.861s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6148.507s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6150.087s">With</a> the consolidation of both these commissions, will there be the same number of seats?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6161.009s">So,</a> so the number is going to stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6163.33s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6163.81s">Are</a> there any openings currently?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6178.588s">I</a> want to personally thank the members of the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6181.55s">Uh,</a> this is a very important task in our community and under your leadership, uh, in my opinion, uh, this community is moving forward on many fronts and, uh, of which housing and human rights are at the top of at least my list as a member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6197.119s">So</a> I want to thank you and the committee and thank the members for coming out tonight and listening to government at its best. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6204.344s">At</a> certain points it may not seem that way, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6207.216s">But</a> we do get to the root of what we need to do to do the people's business.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8139.652s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8141.454s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8144.016s">At</a> tonight's Committee of the Whole meeting, the issue of maintenance of this particular Peace Garden was mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8155.566s">And</a> from what we were told, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8157.803s">Uh,</a> the maintenance has not been outlined as of yet, but currently I guess is in the process of putting together a full fledged maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8169.747s">And,</a> um, I was hoping that we would have this prior to any vote of this council as we, uh, know from, uh, past experience in this community that, um, any project that moves forward, uh, the mayor and the administration is always looking for <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8187.295s">a</a> maintenance infrastructure plan on how we're going to maintain, which is going to be city property, how we're going to maintain that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8197.741s">And</a> I would see this park as no difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8200.502s">I</a> realize the administration is touting this Peace Garden and that's under the mayor's purview to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8210.868s">However,</a> while we have so many infrastructure demands, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8215.738s">on</a> both the municipal and educational fronts that require immediate attention in our community, I would support a balanced approach, Mr. President, of the $1,298,725, which would provide a modest memorial honoring the Boston Marathon victims while recognizing the local needs that we currently are addressing within our community, i.e., <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8245.742s">road</a> and sidewalk repairs, educational programming, municipal building maintenance and repair, enhanced public safety measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8254.748s">You</a> know, we heard tonight that the different earmarks that are going to pay for this Peace Garden and Wynn Resorts has a total of two payments of a combined $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8274.149s">I</a> as one person that live in the Wellington area, and I think we all recognize this issue when the casino was first mentioned going to Everett, was the number one concern that residents had was the traffic impact in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8289.356s">And</a> then the number two was public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8291.717s">And</a> number three was the impact it would have to the local business economy in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8298.501s">And</a> I am very disappointed that <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8301.91s">The</a> mayor opted to put $250,000 from Wynn Resorts into a Peace Garden when, in my opinion, the number one issues that were mentioned over the past year should have been on the table and addressed, whether it's public safety, whether it's traffic mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8322.934s">Any</a> one of those issues, the $250,000 could have gone to improve conditions within our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8333.3s">I</a> am not opposed to memorializing the devastating impact that that marathon bombing had, in particular on one of our own in the community and four additional others, and many countless people that were injured during that day that still suffer the emotional scars from that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8362.044s">However,</a> I believe that we could do this in a way that we could accomplish that goal and also accomplish the many needs that we hear over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8372.651s">As</a> you can see within the chamber itself today, we have construction being done on the ceiling and parts of the ceiling that are caving in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8380.196s">We</a> all know the conditions of our municipal buildings throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8385.219s">We</a> heard earlier tonight about 1,200,000 of improvements needed in our public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8391.438s">And</a> the list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8393.179s">And</a> I'm not saying that this demand list or this list that's out there of needs should replace any other thing that may take place in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8402.745s">We</a> always need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8404.626s">However,</a> I think there could be a balance of the spending on this particular memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8410.849s">And</a> I would support moving forward on a modest memorial, one that can accomplish that goal and also accomplish the goals <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8421.162s">that</a> are before us in our community regarding public safety, regarding road repairs, regarding infrastructure, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8428.087s">So</a> those are the comments I wanted to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8430.508s">And</a> I also wanted to clarify that the construction cost may be $1,128,725, but you also have to factor in the design and the initial survey cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8439.494s">That's</a> $170,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8440.015s">And</a> that brings it up to the figure I mentioned, a million — almost $1,300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8451.552s">It's</a> $1,298,725. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8454.953s">And</a> I don't know how my colleagues feel on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8458.394s">I</a> believe the current lack of a maintenance plan, although it's in the works, and I'm not doubting it's not in the works, this project, according to the mayor, according to the article I have from the Boston Globe, and this was dated April 11, 2014, it said the design plans have been in the works for 11 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8480.842s">So</a> that would date that back to May of 2013, Mr. President, that this proposal was out there in the administration and his staff was working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8493.132s">And</a> we, as a council, had very little input because my input at the time would have been, let's go, let's get something done, but not to that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8503.52s">We</a> have too many needs in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8505.462s">So</a> those are my comments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8507.971s">Um,</a> and I look eager to hear what my colleagues have to say on the motion of approval by Councilor Dello Russo clerk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9665.047s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9665.307s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9666.828s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9667.969s">Again,</a> I would just caution my council colleagues that moving forward on a plan that doesn't include maintenance is not being fiscally responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9681.447s">And</a> I would also state, Mr. President, that we're looking at contractual services. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9689.991s">Now,</a> it's been discussed that we're not sure what the DPW is going to handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9694.053s">But</a> at some point, we're going to outsource services. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9697.494s">And</a> we don't know what the actual cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9700.576s">And</a> I believe, as a member of this council, before we move forward on any project, especially with the track record this city has <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9710.428s">on</a> maintaining our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9712.769s">If</a> this city had an impeccable record of maintaining its current infrastructure, such as City Hall, the Police Department, the Public Library, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9722.015s">the,</a> the dilapidated DPW yard, the fire stations, the list goes on and on our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9728.638s">Um,</a> then I would say if our record was impeccable, yes, you know, I have every faith and trust that the city is going to come out and devise a plan that makes sense on behalf of, uh, the rate pays in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9741.185s">However,</a> that is not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9743.986s">And</a> I think asking the question beforehand just makes common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9749.509s">That's</a> the only thing I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9750.35s">It</a> makes common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9751.553s">You</a> know, we heard tonight that none of this is going to be taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9756.317s">And</a> we all know, as was mentioned, grants and so forth come from taxpayers' money, which Lauren is correct on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9764.022s">My</a> issue is not the fact that there's taxpayer money being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9768.606s">The</a> money that's going into this project could be allocated for a different use. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9774.81s">The</a> 250 from wind management <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9778.0s">could</a> go for anything we want in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9780.801s">And</a> don't let anyone tell you otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9782.761s">This</a> happened to be the mayor at his pecking order list, and he chose to use it for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9788.503s">Now,</a> that's every prerogative the mayor has, and good for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9792.244s">But</a> that 250,000 could have been used for any need in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9797.045s">The</a> Cummings Foundation, if you read their grant application, it includes a list of causes, and this is not limited to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9805.948s">human</a> services, education, healthcare, social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9810.21s">And</a> if you look at, it's the 100K for 100 programs, it's $10 million a year the Cummings Foundation gives out to local cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9820.374s">The</a> town of Burlington got their 100,000 and they're using it for a mobile command unit facilitating greater effectiveness and management of critical police incidences and the lives and safety of the people in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9835.932s">That's</a> what they're using it for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9837.713s">Now,</a> Reading's using it for understanding disabilities to meet increased needs of students and families by renewing its disability awareness curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9846.337s">Watertown's</a> using it to support early stage empowerment programs, reaching people with early stage Alzheimer's disease to improve quality of lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9855.962s">That's</a> what some of the communities are using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9858.804s">The</a> mayor sought to use the $100,000 to apply for the application to do a peace guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9864.526s">That's</a> his prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9865.834s">I</a> just want my colleagues to know that there's other potential uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9870.096s">The</a> park rent, it says in the park rent itself under section C eligible projects are those for the purchase of parkland development of a new park or renovation of an existing park by any municipality with an improved open space and recreation plan, which we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9888.177s">So</a> that could be used for one of 24 different parks, and I realize the mayor just came before us to renovate a few more parks in the community, but I is one that attended the parks as growing up in this city, and also my kids know the need in each individual park, inherit from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9906.853s">So</a> I believe that the park grant money, if the mayor opted to, the $299,000 could have been spent <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9915.77s">to</a> revitalize some of the parks in the community, and we could have put together a committee and so forth to find out what the actual needs are rather than someone dictate what the needs are, and move forward on improving many of our parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9932.36s">So</a> there are a host of issues that could have been looked at with this money, and the mayor opted to use it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9942.086s">I</a> happen to have a fundamental disagreement with the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9945.385s">On</a> this, I think we could accomplish both goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9948.346s">However,</a> I was never involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9952.688s">According</a> to the article in the Globe, April 11th, says that the design plans have been in the works for 11 months, but McGlynn said the proposal was kept private because the city did not have the money to build the Goddard. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9967.708s">So</a> they were working on this with his inner circle for a number of months, and we found out about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9975.65s">I</a> speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9976.91s">I</a> found out about it by turning on the local news. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9979.711s">That's</a> how I found out about it as a member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9983.532s">So,</a> you know, I think, honestly, Mr. President, I don't think anyone wants to be pitted one way or another <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9992.873s">I</a> think it's a worthy proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9995.135s">Do</a> I think we could make handicap improvements and disability improvements to the senior center without building a peace garden? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10002.921s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10004.022s">I</a> mean, we don't need a peace garden to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10006.143s">And</a> I would say, why weren't we doing this in the last 10 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10010.147s">You</a> know, provide what's necessary for the senior center in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10017.812s">One</a> last thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10022.549s">You</a> know, it was back in October 27, 2014, that there was an article posted in the Medford transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10033.155s">And</a> from what I understand, it was a press release from the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10037.777s">And</a> the first paragraph is, and this is October 27, 2014, Mayor Michael McGlynn was pleased to accept a $299,350 in grant funding <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10051.53s">from</a> the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, Parkland Acquisitions and Renovations for Communities Park Grant Program, which will be used towards the construction of the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10063.82s">Tonight</a> we heard that this grant wasn't approved until sometime the beginning of December and maybe a couple of weeks prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10073.878s">So</a> I'm not sure how the mayor takes the liberty to come out before the grants approved by the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, accepts the check, which is a picture in the paper, I'm not making this up, and Lauren, you're in the picture, accepts the check, and then says, don't worry about the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10096.275s">We</a> know they're gonna accept this check. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10099.114s">Don't</a> worry about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10100.555s">I'm</a> going to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10101.195s">I'm</a> going to have my own press conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10102.836s">I'm</a> going to release my own press releases in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10106.859s">And</a> then the council will eventually vote on it, like everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10111.041s">They'll</a> vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10112.382s">They'll</a> submit to my pressure, and they'll vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10115.524s">So</a> I would say, Mr. President, that, as I stated at the beginning, I support a modest memorial honoring the victims of the bombing of the marathon and with <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10128.004s">The</a> additional monies that could be used, such as the Wynn grant, as far as I'm concerned, the Cummings grant would have to reapply and put what we really need in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10140.009s">But</a> that would be my — if I had my druthers, that would be what would happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10144.752s">So,</a> tonight, I cannot support this grant that's before us for the $299,000, based on the reasons I just mentioned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10153.075s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10153.816s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11160.825s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11164.687s">The</a> commercial pays the second rate, which is higher than the first rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11169.69s">So</a> if you're a residential user and you use 700 cubic feet, you're going to pay that low rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11175.684s">Once</a> you go over the 800, 801, for that one cubic foot, you're paying the high rate for that one foot.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11187.627s">Automatically.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11818.433s">Just</a> if I could touch upon that, and I appreciate Councilor Caraviello bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11823.995s">That</a> marks the second fatality in that particular area within the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11831.059s">Two</a> fatalities in the past year on that particular stretch of High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11837.402s">I've</a> offered several resolutions regarding the lighting in front of the school and in front of the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11843.912s">in</a> that particular area and along High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11847.413s">And</a> this council has offered many, many suggestions on traffic-calming approaches in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11854.956s">And</a> as I mentioned before, we need to take back our streets from speeders and people that are breaking the rules and the laws of the roads, going through stop signs, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11864.759s">And</a> it's unfortunate that an incident like this takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11868.74s">However,</a> it's becoming more <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11873.847s">available</a> in this community, and we're seeing more pedestrian accidents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11880.413s">And</a> I don't know what we need to do, Mr. President, but we've discussed about widening sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11885.757s">We've</a> talked about raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11889.56s">We</a> have a pilot program going on right now, and we still fall short of the mark, in my opinion, in providing pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11898.127s">We</a> don't clearly mark our crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11901.769s">They're</a> not painted in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11904.07s">The</a> lighting throughout the community is poor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11907.773s">The</a> signage is inadequate, in my opinion, throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11911.815s">And</a> we very seldom see any type of traffic stings or radar stings within our community that do have a profound impact in slowing cars on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11925.362s">And</a> really, Mr. President, I don't know what it's going to take, but in my opinion, we're at a situation right now that's epidemic in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11934.486s">And</a> when you have two pedestrians within a year's span killed in the same area, Mr. President, that should raise a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11943.09s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gmU8To7cLAU/2025-03-21_gmU8To7cLAU.html">Medford City Council - December 2, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=433.974s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=434.394s">On</a> the motion of approval, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=438.095s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=439.216s">Uh,</a> if you can record me in opposition, uh, until we come up with, uh, an ordinance to cover the taxi licenses, Mr. President,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=479.339s">Is</a> that working, that mic?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1201.643s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1203.424s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1204.505s">And</a> the way I read this is that you're looking for financial data. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1211.629s">Does</a> this also include any inventory? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1214.514s">that</a> the City of Method is now in receipt of. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1218.238s">Have</a> we ever received an itemized list of any inventory from Channel 3?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1253.07s">So,</a> so Mr. President, if we could, and I have no problem asking for the financial data, I think that's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1259.8s">but</a> also if we can get an itemized list of the inventory that was received, and I know Mr. Rumley said that he has a number of items, and I believe he has a list, I just never, I've never seen it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1273.688s">So</a> if we can add that to this resolution, I would be in full support.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1750.262s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1751.402s">Anyone</a> familiar with this particular shelter? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1754.338s">Uh,</a> it's across from the CVS on Riverside Ave, uh, right, uh, adjacent to the Harvard van God parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1763.941s">And,</a> uh, I had the opportunity just recently to, uh, actually go and sit underneath the shelter and just look around and see the condition of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1773.563s">And</a> I was, uh, really, uh, taken back by, uh, the lack of, uh, maintenance, uh, for this particular shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1781.866s">The</a> paint is, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1783.674s">peeling</a> off the side of the shelter itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1787.096s">There</a> are gutters that are missing and hanging off. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1790.699s">Inside</a> was in very dirty condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1795.301s">I</a> don't believe, I think the intention originally was to use this particular shelter for people waiting to catch the bus on the opposite side of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1805.148s">And</a> I for one have never seen anyone waiting for a bus in that particular shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1811.011s">I</a> do see <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1812.607s">people</a> hanging around in the shelter, which I'm not opposed to, but it crossed me when I was in it, Mr. President, that this would be an ideal location in the middle of Medford Square to possibly have some type of wall put around the perimeter, maybe three sides of it, and maybe for eight to 10 months a year, have an art gallery or some type of arts <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1842.209s">uh,</a> located right in the smack of a method square. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1846.23s">Uh,</a> you could also have a portion of it cause it's a good size, um, uh, coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1853.151s">Uh,</a> maybe you could put a portion as a fruit slash vegetable, uh, stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1858.392s">There's</a> so many different repurposes of that particular, um, uh, shelter that really is, in my opinion, an eyesore and not being used to its full potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1872.538s">And</a> it's been like that for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1873.839s">It's</a> not recent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1875.1s">It's</a> not the last week, month, year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1877.262s">It's</a> been like that for years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1879.624s">And</a> I would hope that the mayor takes this council vote, because I'm gonna ask for a vote that the city of Medford look at repurposing that particular shelter for other community uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1892.514s">And</a> I just throw out a couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1893.895s">I'm</a> sure there may be 20 or 30 other uses that residents or committee might have envisioned <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1901.467s">for</a> that particular property, but it's a prime piece of property that right now is an eyesore and could have so many potential uses, and if you wanted to put a little heat inside of it and close it off and make it a glassed-in area, I mean, the potential is endless, and you could use it year-round, and you could provide more lighting in that particular area, because at night, if you ever walk down there, it's very dark on that side behind the cemetery, the Salem Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1931.022s">uh,</a> burial, uh, uh, cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1934.184s">And,</a> um, I would ask that, uh, we take a vote on this tonight to repurpose it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1939.166s">Mr.</a> President asked the mayor if, uh, he is too busy with a lot of other issues, maybe this council could take the ball and run with it and, uh, find a use for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1950.171s">But</a> I would like to start off with the administration, um, to repurpose that particular, uh, shelter on the motion of council of marks to council of Penta.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2768.305s">Before</a> we adjourn, several weeks back this council took a vote <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2773.45s">on</a> sending a couple of issues to the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2777.093s">One</a> was the closing off of the corner of Main and Yale Street, and the other one was to add bollards to the Harvard and Main Street corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2789.444s">And</a> I was wondering if we can get an update if the Traffic Commission received it, and when will that appear on the Traffic Commission agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2797.751s">Also,</a> the second point, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2799.887s">I</a> believe we voted for a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss moving the bus stop on Main Street, you know, 20 or 30 feet down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2808.851s">And</a> if you can set that up, maybe sometime after the holidays or...

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=974.247s">Bruce,</a> as the commission looked at the number of bicycle racks currently in the community, do we have bicycle racks in most of the downtown?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1020.101s">So</a> that will be part of a future recommendation?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1034.147s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1034.987s">And</a> just my other question was, uh, I work in Boston and, uh, with their bike racks, uh, I noticed that, uh, some bicycle repair kits that are somehow affixed to the racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1047.833s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1048.443s">And</a> they have basic wrenches and other small pumps and just some tools that I guess bicyclists could find helpful to have along their trails. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1058.994s">Is</a> that something also that the commission would consider? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1062.208s">having</a> maybe a few of these sprinkled throughout the city?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1073.772s">Uh,</a> you know, bike racks, uh, I don't think of that costly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1077.454s">So</a> I think that should be something that we, as a city of 56,000 people can, uh, can afford to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1082.936s">We're</a> building a million dollar peace garden in the square here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1086.017s">I'm</a> sure we can add some bicycle racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1088.645s">And</a> I would like to see that as a recommendation from the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1091.927s">And,</a> uh, you know, if you need support of the council, I think as you hear the council is very supportive of these initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1099.231s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1099.732s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1100.072s">Thanks</a> for all your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1101.193s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1101.573s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1102.994s">Thank</a> you, Bruce. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1103.554s">Not</a> so fast.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1690.486s">Maybe</a> someone from the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1691.767s">Has</a> there been any consideration regarding the maintenance of these particular <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1696.329s">Bike</a> lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1699.87s">Thank</a> you, Chief.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1714.353s">And</a> what schedule is that, Bruce?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1718.634s">That's</a> the problem.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1735.466s">So</a> maybe as a commission, the commission members can assist us as a community to make sure that the city stays on top of these public safety issues from bike lanes to crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1746.134s">It's</a> very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1747.595s">Um,</a> and they've been neglected over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1749.416s">So</a> I would hate to see them put down one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1751.783s">And</a> next year, Bruce, your lane's on physical.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2017.331s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2018.512s">Um,</a> on November 19th, the city of Malden held a public forum, uh, held by, uh, mayor Christensen and several of the city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2030.785s">in</a> Malden, I believe it was at the Beebe School. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2034.168s">At</a> that particular meeting, they discussed the development proposal to convert the Malden Hospital, which has been closed since 1999, into 398 living units. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2049.62s">And</a> the developer that was present and made a presentation was Felsmere Housing Group. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2057.586s">And</a> they spoke at the meeting, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2060.653s">about</a> the site itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2063.956s">They</a> spoke about the 398 living units of which 80 were assisted living apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2074.044s">275</a> were market rate apartment units. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2078.007s">There</a> were 26 condo units and 17 single family cottages that were being built in the style of Nantucket housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2090.953s">Also,</a> they spoke about the barrier that's currently in between the Malden Hospital and many of the Method residents, which has been referred to as a wooden buffer that actually has a brook running through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2109.523s">And</a> that buffer and wooded area would stay as is under this particular proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2118.067s">Also,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2119.917s">At</a> the meeting, Mr. President, there were a number of Method residents that were not formally notified, but found out through the grapevine that there was a meeting being held in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2134.308s">As</a> we all are aware, many Method residents live closer to this particular site than Malden residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2143.214s">And</a> the impact of the surrounding area <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2147.478s">Lund,</a> Grover, Fry, Murray Hill would be just as much if not more than an impact on Malden residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2158.747s">And</a> the resolution I want to offer tonight is the first resolution is to make sure that any meeting held regarding the Malden Hospital and the potential reuse and development of the Malden Hospital that the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2177.124s">notify</a> the direct abutters in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2180.086s">That's</a> my first motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2183.549s">Also</a> at the meeting, there was a conceptual drawing that was showed at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2191.055s">And</a> the access road is Hospital Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2194.818s">If</a> you go up the hill, you'll know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2195.919s">If</a> you come on up the hill, Hospital Road is on your right. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2199.242s">That</a> leads you into the back of the Malden Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2204.406s">And</a> then if you go a little further up, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2207.099s">There</a> is Lund Road, and the plan itself calls for the creation of a new street from this particular project, linking it to Lund Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2220.145s">And</a> all of us that have been around for some time and the neighbors who have lived there realize that when that area was opened into the Malden Hospital, it was a nightmare for area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2234.091s">There</a> was a concern with <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2236.514s">traffic</a> issues, there was a concern with public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2239.856s">At</a> one point, a four-way stop had to be put at that particular area to alleviate some of the concerns of area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2250.505s">I</a> had a discussion with Chief Sacco, and he agreed that the opening of that particular area, which leads into Lund, would have a devastating impact <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2264.667s">on</a> area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2266.729s">And</a> my second resolution, Mr. President, my second motion, actually, would be to call for an immediate erection of a barrier on the Method side, because right now there's a barrier that was put up by Hallmark Health some years ago, and it's closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2289.344s">But</a> under these plans, if this proposal goes through, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2292.84s">Their</a> barrier will be removed, and they're going to expect having access in and out from their particular development into our Medford neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2302.404s">And</a> from the residents I spoke with, many homeowners who contacted me just recently regarding this issue, they have grave concerns with reopening that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2316.53s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I find it a little ironic that <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2322.041s">I</a> realized this is a Malden project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2324.263s">It's</a> Malden hospital, but part of the surrounding property at Malden hospital is method land and their proposal calls for building 17 single family cottages, as I mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2337.154s">Um,</a> and nine of the 17 cottages are located on method property. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2342.818s">So</a> those homes would be built that pay taxes to method. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2346.001s">There</a> would be method property for all official reasons and not one resident <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2351.437s">in</a> the area, and no one from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2354.599s">Well,</a> not one resident from the area was notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2357.641s">As</a> far as I know, the city administration was notified of the meeting, but there was no one there representing our city and safeguarding our neighborhoods, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2368.327s">So,</a> on behalf of the neighborhood, I know there's maybe a resident or two that took the time to come up tonight that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2376.172s">But</a> on behalf of the residents, Mr. President, I think it's only appropriate that <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2380.759s">we</a> take a vote to immediately have a barrier erected there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2385.2s">And</a> I know years ago, there was a concern about having fire access and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2390.602s">And</a> that could be accommodated, like many of the other barriers that exist in this community right now, where the fire department has access to get through a barrier and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2400.305s">So</a> I would ask that those two motions be put, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2404.367s">And</a> if anyone from the particular area would like to speak here tonight.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2424.789s">A</a> gate, a metal gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2426.63s">I</a> mean, it could be any type of structure, but a gate that could be easily accessed by the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2432.495s">I</a> know if anyone's interested, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2435.388s">uh,</a> on, uh, I think it's eighth or ninth street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2437.489s">There's,</a> there's a gate back there that was put up some years ago that the fight department, I think have a lecture electronic gadget when they're heading to gain access in spring road as well, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2446.776s">There's</a> several of them in the city actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2448.737s">So</a> I understand it's been accomplished before. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2451.919s">And,</a> um, like I said, uh, this, uh, according to the chief, uh, and he's been around for some time that when this area was open back some years ago, it really posed a public safety concern in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2464.906s">And</a> I don't believe that our neighborhoods should be turned into a cut through, uh, for traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2470.208s">Uh,</a> it's a great way of omitting, uh, getting out and try to go on to, uh, the Fellsway from Salem street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2476.991s">You</a> can cut through the neighborhoods and end up onto the Fellsway if you want to go 93 or so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2482.093s">And,</a> uh, it really impacts a large, uh, area around our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2486.994s">And</a> I don't think it should be used as a cut through. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2489.597s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2596.391s">You</a> know if that really is even the case and if the mayor didn't want to go we do have an office community development We do have other department heads that do attend meetings
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3118.784s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3120.245s">As</a> we're all aware, uh, the entrance to the McGlynn Andrews school on Riverside Ave is, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3125.715s">a</a> well-traveled area in the morning and the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3129.356s">And</a> for the past week and a half, two weeks, there has been no crossing guard there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3134.457s">There</a> has been a Medford police officer sporadically there covering the area, but there are a lot of kids that cross Riverside Ave to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3145.678s">And</a> I'm not quite sure why we can't have a dedicated person there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3152.52s">And</a> if they're in the process of hiring someone, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3155.108s">Why</a> don't we have reserves that we can call upon if need be? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3161.01s">And</a> the chief is here, so maybe we can get an answer right away, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3165.312s">Maybe</a> we could have talked about this when we talked about Grover Road.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3298.724s">Are</a> there plans chief to build up the reserve?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3867.982s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3869.342s">Councilor</a> Meis. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3870.583s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3871.743s">And</a> Councilor Knight brings up a lot of good points about best practices, about the vetting process, about evaluating particular people, and I would be in <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3885.057s">whole</a> heart, uh, support, uh, if we included, and I haven't seen your proposal yet, but, uh, it would not limit it to, uh, the president of the council, the vice president of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3899.324s">I</a> mean, uh, you've already voted yourself on the president and the vice president of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3903.967s">Um,</a> I'm not sure what vetting process you took into consideration during that process, but, uh, there are a number of positions, the, uh, all, all the different, uh, committees that, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3915.286s">uh,</a> people are appointed to, uh, all our council committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3919.168s">So</a> I think if we're going to look at a process, I would agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3923.149s">And</a> I think we should start from, uh, the appointment of the president, which is probably our most, uh, important, uh, appointment as a council and work our way down. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3933.273s">So</a> if your proposal includes that, uh, which I hope it does, because tonight there was a meeting to discuss organizational for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3943.127s">And</a> I didn't hear anything about a vetting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3945.569s">I</a> didn't hear about anything about someone's ability to lead this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3950.892s">Uh,</a> so I, I, if it includes all that, that's, that's go for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3954.494s">But</a> I don't think we should just pick and choose, uh, what positions we'd like to take a look at and provide these best practices to. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3962.399s">It</a> should be everyone across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3963.68s">I</a> mean the,
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4478.546s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4480.478s">As</a> Councilor Penta mentioned, um, you know, I find it very interesting that we have permanent signs posted for resident permit parking throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4494.622s">For</a> years, the city did never, no enforcement at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4499.823s">We</a> have a street sweeping program with no permanent signage and they tow and tag cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4508.143s">I</a> can't figure this city out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4511.166s">It</a> doesn't operate correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4515.77s">You</a> have permanent signage, you don't enforce permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4519.232s">You</a> don't have signage for street sweeping, you tag and tow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4522.595s">And</a> this is not the first time we've heard this problem, as many councils will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4528.3s">Last</a> year we faced the same thing, when they tagged and towed a number of cars, and the city had to reflect upon it, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4536.003s">and</a> said they tagged and told an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4538.764s">This</a> happens year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4541.064s">And</a> as a council, I think we've been on board, at least I know myself a dozen times asking the administration to look into permanent street sweeping signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4551.387s">And</a> we have yet to get an answer because we still currently don't have a full fledged street sweeping program in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4559.469s">It's</a> no reflection upon DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4561.893s">It's</a> a reflection upon the administration who refuses to put in place a street-sweeping program that makes sense, that actually sweeps our streets, and does it more frequently than twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4578.184s">It's</a> inadequate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4579.945s">And</a> the fact that we're still using notification methods of an electronic billboard shows you how far behind the times we are in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4589.451s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4826.053s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4826.953s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President, we received two responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4831.017s">If</a> I could just read them from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4833.879s">Um,</a> it was, uh, the first one is a paper 14 dash four nine nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4839.643s">And</a> there was a response, uh, out to, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4842.463s">um,</a> waste management regarding, uh, them picking up trash on major thoroughfares during peak traffic hours in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4851.467s">And</a> we did get a response from James Nocella. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4855.129s">Uh,</a> he is the area manager of waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4857.93s">And</a> if I could just read it, cause this is an important issue, Mr. President says, we have reviewed the council's request for the mayor to alert waste management on picking up trash on main thoroughfares at peak travel times. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4869.996s">The</a> issue was previously brought to our attention, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4872.403s">by</a> the administration as a core to our mission to zero safety program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4876.866s">We</a> continuously review our routing practices and make every effort to avoid high risk situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4883.35s">We</a> will continue to avoid peak travel collection wherever and whenever practical. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4888.214s">Thank</a> you for your concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4890.635s">And</a> also, Mr. President, paper 14-743. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4894.058s">It</a> was a council resolution asking for the lighting on Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4901.056s">from</a> True Value Hardware down, be looked at by the Superintendent Wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4908.761s">And</a> Mr. Hurley came back saying he did go down and inspect and found out there were several lights that were out and he contacted National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4918.327s">So</a> on behalf of the council, I'd like to thank Superintendent Wise, Joe Hurley for his quick action, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5165.19s">Councilor</a> Knight, are you all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5166.33s">I</a> am. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5167.03s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5168.511s">You</a> know, I don't want to speak out of turn, but I think one of the issues originally was the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5174.665s">there</a> was going to be a walkway and some discussion needed to be had between housing and the city of method regarding the walkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5184.95s">Cause</a> it wasn't our area to, to connect. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5188.672s">Um,</a> and I, and I, that was one of the issues, but I'm not sure if that's what this is regarding. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5193.974s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Penta that, you know, you know, we've taken several votes on this already to move money and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5200.697s">And,</a> um, it's only appropriate that we get an answer on this immediately.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_IndO1QdhX3w/2025-03-21_IndO1QdhX3w.html">Medford City Council - November 18, 2014</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=821.057s">And</a> what percent is that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=838.991s">So</a> the buyout's roughly $26,000?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=844.333s">And</a> you're saying we've done this for a lot of pieces of equipment in the past?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2191.384s">call</a> for reconsideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2193.286s">It's</a> not reconsideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2194.326s">He</a> wasn't on the prevailing side. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2196.247s">We</a> never took a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2197.308s">We</a> didn't.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2370.659s">And</a> that should not be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2372.02s">With</a> all due respect, Mr. President, I know you're new to the presidency, but you should not be doing that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2378.363s">With</a> all due respect.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2387.508s">It's</a> easy as that, because the ruling is what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2389.709s">Well,</a> your ruling should have taken place at the podium rather than outside of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2393.791s">Well,</a> it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2394.331s">Because</a> that's where it took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2396.272s">Mr.</a> President.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4743.089s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4744.83s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4746.907s">Regarding</a> the mausoleum study, this council voted back several years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4751.769s">And</a> actually, we just recently, Mr. President, took it off of unfinished business after being on the agenda for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4760.191s">But</a> I wholeheartedly agree with that particular study. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4764.393s">It'll</a> extend the life of the cemetery for a number of years for Medford residents if we were to build a mausoleum at the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4773.196s">So</a> I wholeheartedly support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4775.202s">A</a> couple of questions I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4776.803s">The</a> first one is regarding the speed bumps that were mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4782.906s">In</a> order to put a speed bump on a road, you need approval by the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4787.188s">Have</a> they voted on allowing speed bumps?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4800.215s">But</a> we don't know whether or not they'll approve speed bumps on our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4803.385s">We</a> currently don't have any portable or ever had any portable speed bumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4807.986s">So</a> it's your opinion that this will go through the traffic commission without a problem.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4817.229s">And</a> the reason why I say that is, uh, since I've been on the council, we've had a number of residents that have come up before us requesting these movable speed bumps on particular roads, uh, to calm traffic and calm speed is down. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4832.582s">And</a> we were always told that you can't impede traffic and so forth by the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4839.248s">And</a> now it seems on a major thoroughfare, two major thoroughfares, we're looking at installing these. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4845.333s">So</a> I just don't know what the change of mind is all of a sudden, when before it was always just a dead no to the council when we asked.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4863.218s">Race</a> crosswalks have been around for 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4866.659s">We</a> haven't created the race crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4868.4s">I</a> mean, they've been using the cities for years, but okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4871.282s">You</a> know, I just don't like to approve money when we don't have an official vote of the traffic commission purpose.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4885.609s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4890.853s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4891.673s">Um,</a> I agree with all the different park work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4894.575s">Uh,</a> I think that's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4895.916s">Uh,</a> I would also just ask if we could amend this paper, Mr. President, uh, Harris park as a council, um, a budget, uh, director Burke just mentioned is, is a park that's used, uh, 12 months out of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4910.946s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4911.626s">And</a> it's a heavy traveled park in the taut lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4914.783s">I've</a> brought up on a dozen occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4917.584s">It</a> no longer is a tot lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4920.365s">It</a> is a lot where animals go and do their business because it's mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4928.009s">And</a> it's in awful condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4930.53s">If</a> people went down to the parks, as you mentioned, that would have been the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4934.192s">We've</a> asked that a rubberized flooring be put in, like many of the other parks, first of all, for safety purposes in a tot lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4942.573s">and</a> also to keep animals from going in there and making that their little place where they dig and do their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4950.118s">And</a> that's what it's coming to, and people aren't using that tarp lot anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4953.7s">So</a> I would ask that that area, it's not a giant area to be rubberized, I think would suit its purpose and also benefit many people in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4965.907s">And</a> the other issue, and I had a discussion with the mayor this afternoon regarding all these items, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4972.782s">I</a> asked him about the number of stumps that were going to be removed, and if the 400,000, which includes the water, if there was some water damage and so forth from flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4983.769s">He</a> said it would cover, or he hopes it covers all the stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4987.651s">And</a> my response is that I believe that the current city stump list underestimates what we have out in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4995.836s">No</a> fault of the city, but if they claim there's 180 stumps, I say there's 280 in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5002.677s">And</a> what I would ask is really the only legitimate way of doing this, because we've asked that a complete audit be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5008.618s">I</a> don't know if that's taken place or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5010.979s">And</a> I know there's other priorities, but if we spent a lot of time actually, well, we probably did, but there's some stumps that they're Browning on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5019.801s">That's</a> how long they've been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5020.961s">And</a> you know, you can see they're really aging. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5023.962s">And</a> I would ask that we put the stump list on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5028.197s">So</a> if you have a stump in front of your house, you don't have to say, well, I called five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5031.998s">I</a> don't know if it's still on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5033.419s">I</a> don't know what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5034.699s">You</a> can actually look at the stump list and say, I'm not on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5037.96s">I</a> think I should have been on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5040.121s">And</a> then contact DPW or send an email, call a Councilor, and get yourself on the stump list. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5046.723s">And</a> I think that's an effective way of managing what's currently out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5050.685s">And</a> I think we're going to find that the 180 is probably not 180. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5053.906s">It's</a> more like 280. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5055.667s">That's</a> my own personal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5057.526s">from</a> traversing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5058.987s">So</a> I would ask that as part of this paper, Mr. President, that we ask that the full stump list be put on for review for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5068.035s">On</a> the city website? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5068.755s">On</a> the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5071.657s">And</a> the only other question I really had was regarding the lead conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5078.263s">Any</a> idea how long that's going to take?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5097.267s">So</a> we're looking at the springtime? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5098.508s">Springtime.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5108.215s">And</a> are they still currently changing the lenses?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5114.377s">I've,</a> I'll spot them out to him, but I've seen a number of them in the school.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5123.081s">I</a> don't think it's completed as of yet.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5127.563s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5128.463s">And</a> also, uh, up the hillside, I had a business owner that called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5131.665s">I</a> went up, uh, last week actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5134.346s">And,</a> uh, the side where the liquor store is on up the hillside, that whole area is completely dark at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5141.048s">And</a> it looks like it's actually missing, not that streetlights are out, that it's missing streetlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5150.275s">The</a> liquor store up the hillside, right across from Hillside Hardware. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5157.621s">That</a> whole section over there is completely dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5162.285s">And</a> someone needs to take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5165.967s">If</a> I could, Mr. President, when we're talking about light conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5171.193s">Other</a> than that, I support everything that's on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5176.935s">It</a> all makes sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5178.476s">I</a> appreciate the fact that we're able to go through it and ask questions, not just for our ratification. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5184.278s">You</a> know, it's easy for a councilor to sit back and say, I'm well aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5188.179s">I</a> attended a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5189.0s">I</a> talked to the mayor, and this is great for the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5191.981s">But</a> it's interesting to hear, and that's why people tune in, to listen and hear what's going on and be able to ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5200.837s">and</a> it's great to have meetings that are open to the public, but we all know, I mean, we have a meeting up here every night, and if you get 10, every Tuesday night, if you get 10 people, you're lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5211.681s">A</a> Committee of the Whole meeting, if you get three people, you're lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5214.902s">Of</a> a city of 57,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5217.763s">So</a> I don't buy into the fact that just because there's a Committee of the Whole, that everyone else in the community's on board, and I think this is very helpful to sit and go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5226.666s">It</a> didn't take long to do, and I thank Councilor Penter <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5230.711s">bringing</a> this up, because it's an important issue that we go through and get the answers, not only on behalf of the council, but on behalf of the people of this community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5332.398s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Lachs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5334.52s">We</a> were told by the mayor himself that fountains were going to be maintained by an outside group.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5346.313s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5346.533s">So,</a> so the maintenance will not be done by the city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5352.758s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5352.998s">I</a> mean, there's not much moment to do.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5359.323s">So</a> there is going to be an expense that a perpetual care fund will have to be set up to maintain just the fountains.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6898.314s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6904.175s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6905.516s">And,</a> um, I, I agree with many of these, uh, structural improvements and, uh, fixes to the roof and so forth of, uh, this historic property. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6916.019s">I</a> think the larger issue that remains and we're all aware of is the access road. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6921.338s">leading</a> up to the manor and the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6923.84s">And</a> it's been just probably several months since you've been before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6929.904s">Has</a> there been any update?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6984.237s">What</a> are we talking roughly for?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7051.796s">So</a> is EMBEL prepared to make a request to the administration?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7086.94s">in</a> terms of potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7088.121s">Right,</a> but the study would be the first step in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7091.463s">Yeah,</a> it's... It'd answer a lot of questions that are lingering right now.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7100.47s">And</a> if I had $100,000 to contribute to pay for the study, I would do it, but I don't, so... Well, you know, there seems to be a lot of money floating around from wind management, from free cash, and all other avenues around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7114.0s">And</a> to me, this would be an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7116.552s">I</a> think we all can appreciate the fact, whether you agree with funding for the Brooks Estates or not, that the access road is extremely important and is vital to the success of the Brooks Estates, even in its current condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7133.901s">And</a> I, as one member, would hope that EMBELT approach the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7139.824s">We</a> will do that, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7141.565s">And</a> get this moving.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7175.246s">The</a> city has embarked on feasibility studies for <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7178.473s">the</a> parking garage in Governor's Ave that never came to fruition, a feasibility study about a water taxi on the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7186.557s">And</a> here we have an historic piece of property, as we all know, if not attended to, is going to end up vanishing into the ground eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7196.423s">And</a> I would hate to see that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7198.584s">And</a> I think for the amount of money we're talking about, it only makes sense <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7204.417s">to</a> move forward on that very basic issue of the access road. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7206.778s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7208.199s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7729.391s">I</a> have the paper in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7730.372s">Mr.</a> President, everything appears to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7733.014s">Uh,</a> this seems to be a simple request of, uh, an awning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7736.911s">This,</a> as the gentleman mentioned, Avelinos has been a long established business in our community with a fantastic reputation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7745.554s">And</a> I would motion for approval tonight and wish them well.

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9109.044s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9110.404s">I</a> just want to speak briefly on the passing of Mr. John Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9115.625s">For</a> any of us that know Mr. Murphy, he was a family man, a husband, a father, a grandfather, a very active parishioner at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9126.088s">Joseph's</a> Parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9127.929s">He</a> also was a worker at Verizon for 44 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9134.782s">And</a> he will be sorely missed by his three children and six grandchildren and many residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9143.848s">Here</a> is a man, Mr. President, that has always put his family first and, after retirement, had some health concerns and never really bothered anyone, kept it to himself, as you mentioned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9162.102s">you</a> know, for several years, um, fought diligently, uh, and succumb to his illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9170.487s">And</a> I wish the family well, uh, along with the children and the grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9175.75s">And</a> he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9177.011s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10361.729s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10363.75s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10365.678s">As</a> we're probably all aware, and maybe some of us aren't, Curtis Tufts was created many years ago to suit a need in the community for students that, for one reason or another, weren't able to attend the high school in that particular setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10383.104s">Some</a> of it was for learning reasons, some of it was for discipline reasons, and the alternative high school, which is Curtis Tufts, was created for Method students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10394.267s">and</a> allowed them to move forward to eventually get their diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10399.188s">And</a> over the years, if you want to track it, it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10404.95s">The</a> number of students that are being serviced in that school has decreased. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10410.351s">And</a> the number of Method students has been severely decreased. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10415.373s">And</a> at this particular time, we're looking at a few dozen students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10420.778s">and</a> primarily from outside of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10424.119s">Now,</a> I realize there is a tuition that we gain from these outside communities, but as Councilor Penta mentioned, year after year I've been asking during the budget process that we should be taking a look at the per pupil expense and also compare it to the revenue we're receiving and see whether or not this particular program, which was all <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10447.383s">good</a> intentions when it started out is still suiting the purpose of ultimately what it's for, the students of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10456.75s">And</a> I would say if that no longer is taking place, then the school committee and the administration have to take a long hard look at this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10466.777s">I've</a> also mentioned over the years, because as we all know, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10469.726s">The</a> high school was built to house some 3,000 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10474.487s">It's</a> probably a third of the capacity right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10478.908s">And</a> it was mentioned that maybe we could use portions of the high school for this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10485.51s">Because</a> now you're maintaining a separate building. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10488.15s">You're</a> maintaining heat, electricity, physical maintenance of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10492.751s">Last</a> year we had asbestos tiles removed in the building at a great expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10499.971s">And</a> these are the things I think we have to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10503.594s">And</a> I think what Councilor Penta alluded to tonight, the changing of the guard, if you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10509.959s">Mr.</a> Volpe was up there for a number of years as the head of the Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10515.483s">I</a> think speaks volumes at what's going on with that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10520.286s">And</a> I think really the need for the program needs to be explored. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10524.93s">I'm</a> not against students that may have certain problems and need additional help. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10529.737s">I</a> think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10530.978s">I've</a> attended their graduation in the past, and I think they do great things there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10537.222s">But</a> I think, like all programs, this needs to be explored to see if it's still financially beneficial for students and for the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10547.75s">And</a> I hope to get back that information as well, Mr. President, on the per-pupil expense and the current revenue that's being generated from outside placements. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10560.055s">If</a> my council colleague wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend his paper to include those figures also. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10565.86s">And</a> hopefully we'll get an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10567.421s">I</a> know you didn't get an answer a couple of weeks ago, but hopefully we'll get an answer on this paper.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gTjmRR2WUVY/2025-03-21_gTjmRR2WUVY.html">Medford City Council - October 28, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=800.619s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I agree with the restriction on delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=804.821s">I</a> think that's a wise move. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=806.562s">Also,</a> where the gentleman stated, Mr. President, that he believes it's deliveries from other parts or other stores within the mall that we as a council through the city clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=818.613s">send</a> a letter to Meadow Glen Mall to make sure that no deliveries are happening prior to 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=824.535s">in</a> the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=826.456s">I</a> think that's only appropriate for the neighbors and abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=830.137s">I</a> agree with council at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=831.698s">I</a> like the 90 day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=833.879s">And</a> I also agree with councilor Lungo-Koehn that 10 days to me sounds a little excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=840.181s">I</a> think we should probably put a cap on it, maybe at five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=844.003s">That</a> would be something that, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=845.967s">I</a> think would be amendable to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=847.308s">I</a> don't know how my other colleagues feel, but, uh, I would vote in support of this with the restriction on the deliveries and also with the 90 day review and also with council Lungo-Koehn brought up about limiting it to five days, uh, rather than 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=863.539s">And</a> as, as was mentioned, uh, this is open ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=866.401s">So</a> next year there's no need to come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=869.223s">This</a> is going to be in perpetuity, right?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=885.853s">This</a> is amended with a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=888.913s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=889.774s">My</a> issue is actually the number of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=891.534s">I</a> think 10 is excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=893.094s">The</a> 90-day review was offered by council.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1417.739s">I</a> think Attorney Bruese was amendable to eight days, which this covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1421.922s">So</a> maybe we can make it eight days rather than five.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1444.996s">And</a> a letter to the Meadow Glen Mall regarding deliveries that take place between 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1450.098s">and</a> 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1450.718s">in</a> the morning, other than Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1454.0s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1454.08s">I</a> want to send a letter to Austin to refrain from truck deliveries between those hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1459.242s">We</a> have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1459.642s">On</a> behalf of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1461.703s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1611.185s">I</a> want to understand my Councilor colleague's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1615.393s">Why</a> would you think it would be so difficult for us to rescind the perpetuity that allows them to do it every year automatically? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1622.915s">Why</a> would that be so difficult by a vote of the kind? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1625.215s">Just</a> say in a year, two years from now, we say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1627.496s">Even</a> after the 90-day review, we no longer like this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1642.819s">Indefinitely.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1662.998s">My</a> question was to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1664.799s">Why</a> you would think that?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1719.311s">Honestly,</a> I think we have to base every request on its own merits. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1724.607s">And</a> you're right, if it was a business that was nestled in a neighborhood that wanted to open 24 hours, I would look upon it differently than a business that's in a mall establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1736.511s">And</a> even the abutter stated that the front entrance would really have no bearing, people coming through the front entrance, on their sleep and so forth in the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1746.294s">So</a> I think you have to take every petition on its own merits. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1750.616s">But</a> my question was just whether or not <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1754.358s">and</a> a year from now that we as a council can rescind this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1758.222s">And</a> I believe we can do that like on any Tuesday night, and I don't think it's a difficult process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1763.608s">And</a> if this didn't work out for whatever reason, I'm willing to take a vote to rescind.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2118.926s">Just</a> if I could, uh, if, if this is a special permit, as was stated, then we as a council can put conditions on the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2127.65s">So,</a> and we did correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2129.49s">We</a> can also put a condition on the indefinite period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2134.072s">If</a> Councilor Penta feels better about that, we can put some language in there stating that even though this is for an indefinite period of time, that if there are any concerns or complaints brought before the Medford City Council, that the license will be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2150.461s">The</a> special permit will be reviewed automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2153.522s">And</a> that way it's in there, the language at least gives us an option to review it <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2157.683s">and</a> a possible revocation of the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2162.245s">I</a> would offer that if that's... No.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2178.212s">So,</a> we put a condition on the indefinite period of time stating that if there are any <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2187.293s">concerns</a> brought before the Medford City Council relative to the extended hours of operation at Coles that the Medford City Council either hold a hearing or review the special permit and make a decision on the special permit.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2333.308s">Mr.</a> President, maybe if we give initial approval tonight and ask that the city solicit a review language that would cover what we're talking about, that may be... You said something I think could be manageable.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2395.159s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2397.821s">Just</a> if I could, and I hear what my colleague's saying, but the 90 days is for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2403.065s">Next</a> year, there's no 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2405.997s">If</a> something happens next year, we just want to make sure as a council that we have the authority to revoke the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2415.821s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2416.041s">Is</a> that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2417.081s">We</a> just want to make sure we have the authority to revoke, because there's no official review next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2421.523s">The</a> attorney said he doesn't want to come back every year for a review, which I don't blame him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2425.664s">Of</a> course not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2426.105s">I</a> don't blame him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2427.577s">So</a> we want to just put language in there that allows us, and maybe we don't need language, Mr. Clerk.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2437.18s">So</a> should we not ask the city solicitor?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2448.164s">I</a> have no problem granting it with the contingency that the city solicitor provide language to us within the next several days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2457.574s">I</a> mean, we don't meet for two weeks now because of election next Tuesday and the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2463.615s">If</a> that's amendable.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2481.878s">We</a> could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2482.438s">Meanwhile,</a> as the attorney stated, we can ask the city solicitor for his, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2487.14s">opinion</a> on the language within the 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2489.34s">And</a> then we'll attach the language.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2547.666s">So</a> why don't we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2548.386s">Mr.</a> President, not to belabor the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2551.908s">Why</a> don't we approve this year as was stated asked within the, uh, with the 90 day ask, uh, just allow for this year and then ask the city solicitor to come back with his opinion on language that would allow us to review it every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2567.676s">Is</a> that, does that sound acceptable?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2572.178s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2573.619s">Once</a> we get the language, then we will take a vote on the language.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3237.03s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3238.452s">Roughly,</a> how long will the construction take?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3271.261s">Less</a> than five days.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3272.942s">And</a> just one day on the public way.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3306.277s">And</a> what's the length of the trench on the public way?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3318.151s">And</a> where is the trench again on the public way?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3333.674s">The</a> intersection of Emerson and Main?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3341.775s">I</a> have a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3342.535s">I</a> just wanted to know if you can explain it rather than look at that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3414.44s">What</a> other options were there, entrance options?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3425.449s">So</a> you did explore that option?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3429.15s">I'm</a> not up to date on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3433.752s">If</a> something was available, are they obligated to allow your access?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3538.262s">Thank</a> you, Mr. I have a motion for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3540.464s">Councilor</a> Mayne.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3912.548s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3924.072s">And</a> also, do you have a traffic plan?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3947.812s">During</a> the weekdays or weekends?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3955.815s">Mr.</a> President, too, just if I may add, and I know this is standard language, but what you just read, the last sentence says underground work will be done and there should be no disturbance to the city of Medford sidewalk or roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3969.541s">Doesn't</a> make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3971.762s">We</a> know that they're going to disturb. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3973.123s">They're</a> digging up the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3974.784s">So</a> that sentence really doesn't make any sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3979.485s">Maybe</a> if we can have that reviewed by the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3985.048s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3985.849s">I</a> know it's her language, but it doesn't make sense.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3991.713s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3992.634s">I</a> don't recall that language in other petitions, but previous nights, but I would motion for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5460.132s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5461.393s">I</a> think the one good thing is we're all in agreement here, behind the reeling, from what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5465.734s">And</a> I think it's prudent to have this particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5468.435s">I</a> thank Councilor Penta for starting the ball rolling on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5472.256s">This</a> impacts a lot of people that are in the retirement system, and it really needs to be reviewed by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5479.037s">And</a> as was mentioned, the longer we wait, the bigger the unfunded liability becomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5484.518s">And</a> at some point, it's going to become something that we're not going to even want to approach because it's so unapproachable to figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5491.84s">So</a> I thank my colleague for bringing this up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6764.892s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6766.133s">And</a> both speakers brought up some very valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6769.355s">And</a> Jeanne, you're 100% correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6773.417s">Every</a> resident in this community is losing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6777.205s">You</a> know, even if you're not involved in local cable or want to produce your own show, the fact that we don't have the opportunity to look at high school sports on our local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6788.988s">I</a> remember the days where they used to have live feeds and you could watch the Medford High football game live on local cable for those people that couldn't get to the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6799.153s">Council</a> President, I think it was you that a year or two ago asked that all the boards and commissions, their meetings be taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6808.5s">On</a> channel 16, which I thought, and I think it was voted by this council, an excellent way of providing transparency in this community and allowing residents to get involved or look into the process of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6825.713s">And</a> I thought that was an excellent suggestion, but again, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6829.229s">The</a> residents are being stifled because there's no access in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6834.292s">Several</a> weeks back, we had what I would say is one of the largest meetings in this community in the last 25 years regarding parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6845.178s">And</a> that's an issue that's going to impact every resident in this community, every business owner in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6852.122s">And</a> we couldn't get that on local access to show the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6856.971s">The</a> meeting was taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6858.132s">We</a> couldn't get it on local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6860.413s">However,</a> every other event, Mr. President, if you look in Channel 15, is the mayor cutting a ribbon, the mayor going to the dog run, saying how we're going to have a dog park, telling people we're going to have a dog park in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6875.762s">You</a> know, it's almost laughable what is happening in this community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6882.066s">As</a> Councilor Penta said, you have one person controlling all access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6887.222s">all</a> media access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6889.244s">Even</a> the cameras here that are on the blink every so often, we have to beg the mayor to fix the cameras so viewers at home can watch our meeting without the tape going off and on, without the voice going up and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6902.596s">You</a> know, it really is a shame what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6906.6s">And</a> I, as one member of the council, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6911.548s">think</a> maybe it has come time that maybe that we do look at a class action suit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6920.85s">And</a> I don't take this very lightly when I mention it, Mr. President, but there's no reason that ratepayers' money, week after week, month after month, year after year, is going into funding something that we're not providing to the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6936.757s">And</a> it's no different than resident permit parking stickers for years that may have had residents buy permit parking stickers and never enforced permit parking in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6949.28s">Never</a> enforced it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6950.56s">It</a> wasn't until one of the news stations came down and did a story on it that it uncovered many people parking on our streets, on resident permit streets, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6964.65s">that</a> didn't have stickers from other cities, days on end, and no enforcement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6971.594s">So,</a> there seems to be a pattern here with the mayor of, you know, in one breath saying, leadership that works, and on the other breath, doing absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6982.661s">Absolutely</a> nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6983.722s">If</a> I look in the local media again, in one of the websites, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6987.067s">and</a> see another picture of the mayor walking around promoting candidates running for public office and not doing his job here at City Hall, Mr. President, to me, that's grounds for termination right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7000.135s">We</a> have so many issues that really, you should not see the mayor at a ribbon cutting for the next five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7006.278s">His</a> head should be buried in that office, working on the issues that he has promised the people and the residents of this community for the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7015.593s">And</a> the inaction in this community speaks volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7018.855s">It</a> speaks volumes, Mr. President, on what's going on throughout this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7023.497s">And</a> what you're hearing now is a sense of frustration, because it's not one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7027.719s">It's</a> many, many, many issues that are starting to build up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7031.621s">And</a> people are starting to get wise to it, saying, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7034.362s">Enough's</a> enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7036.063s">Enough's</a> enough in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7038.124s">And</a> whether it's the cable, whether it's parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7041.185s">And</a> just if I could, Mr. President, on parking enforcement, Councilor Prenta brought up <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7045.755s">and</a> I won't steal his thunder, a few weeks back, the fact that the language that supposedly the mayor had added to the parking contract that stated there'll be two 30-minute free parking spots in each of the five business districts, and that there'll be a certain number of single head meters in each of the five business districts, as Councilor Penta so eloquently stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7073.244s">That</a> language was never included in the final contract that was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7078.148s">And</a> I asked the city solicitor, and I'm not going to speak on his behalf, I said, why is that language not in the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7084.394s">And</a> he said, that language is outside of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7087.897s">He</a> said, there's a lot of language that is included in the request for proposal that is not in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7094.362s">but</a> enables the city to move forward on issues like providing additional free parking spots in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7102.508s">So</a> when the mayor came back to the business owners and said, I'm going to give two additional free 30-minute parking spots in each of the five business districts, he didn't have to negotiate that with Republic, the Tennessee company. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7115.678s">He</a> did that unilaterally, and he did it without any vote of this council and without any other support. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7122.846s">In</a> my situation, Mr. President, I would ask that the mayor increase that five-fold, that at least 10 spots, free 30-minute pocket spots be in each of the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7135.755s">And</a> maybe at some point we'll get to a point where Republic says, hey, this changes the financial impact of the contract and we can no longer do this unless we negotiate a new contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7147.203s">But</a> the fact is, Mr. President, the mayor was able to do that <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7151.223s">without</a> any support of Republic or this council or any vote in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7158.207s">And</a> I think, Mr. President, what we're seeing right now is not leadership from a mayor, but dictatorship, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7166.893s">And</a> that's what we're experiencing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7168.834s">After</a> 28 years of the same dictator, we're seeing that it's no longer consensus and trying to find out what's best for our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7179.641s">It's</a> someone just leading <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7181.405s">as</a> a dictator. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7182.626s">And</a> I think that's a sad commentary, what's happening in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7186.369s">And</a> I hope residents of this community get wise to it, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7767.016s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7768.196s">And</a> also, last week, the issue of the South Method neighborhood safety walk was brought up to a resolution offered by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7779.86s">And</a> we had a number of South Method residents here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7783.1s">And</a> at the time, it was mentioned that there was a violation <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7788.855s">of</a> the open meeting law if more than four members of the council attended this particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7795.857s">And</a> where part of my resolution was to try to expand this particular safety walk, I sent an email to the city solicitor and also the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7808.14s">And</a> I believe we all got a response back via email from the city solicitor, Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7815.141s">And</a> I just would like to read it for the edification of <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7818.219s">people</a> that may be watching, I don't want anyone to believe that there was any doubt that there was no violation of the open meeting law at this neighborhood walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7830.908s">But</a> it says, dear Councilor Marks, you have asked me whether the attendance of city councilors at an event organized by a private citizen group for the purpose of addressing neighborhood safety and other related concerns could potentially be a violation of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7846.239s">My</a> answer is that the attendance <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7848.09s">by</a> City Council is at such an event would not be a violation of the Open Meeting Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7852.994s">The</a> basis for my conclusion is that General Law Chapter 38, the Open Meeting Law applies to public bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7860.079s">According</a> to the facts you have presented to me, the neighborhood safety walk was organized by a private citizen group and was neither scheduled by the City Council nor was it subject to the Council's direction or control. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7874.05s">It</a> was therefore essentially an opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7876.427s">for</a> the participants, including the Councilors, to observe conditions in a particular neighborhood rather than to make decisions through a vote of a quorum or the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7887.516s">Even</a> though the private citizen group that called for the walk was concerned with public issues, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7893.061s">neighborhood</a> safety and related issues, it is not a public body as it is not an entity within the executive or legislative branches of state government or within any county, district, city, region, or town. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7905.182s">I</a> hope this answers your opinion.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_A8ucl-IFfU8/2025-03-21_A8ucl-IFfU8.html">Medford City Council - October 21, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=679.103s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=681.044s">Is</a> there any current legislation that you're tracking now or something that maybe we as a Council can review to get on board to support?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=772.708s">Mr.</a> President, just a thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=775.369s">I</a> wonder if we, as a community, can enact our own hands-free ban. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=781.899s">or</a> does that have to be done on the state level? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=785.341s">I'm</a> not sure if that's possible, but maybe we can ask a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=789.763s">I</a> agree with you a hundred percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=790.923s">And</a> I think everyone behind this reeling, uh, that, that, that drives a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=795.385s">Um,</a> that's all you see people on the phone constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=799.847s">Um,</a> and they're not paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=802.068s">Um,</a> and, and that goes for, you know, you hate to say it, but it's not only on the phone, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=806.88s">I</a> see people putting makeup on while they're driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=809.581s">I</a> see people doing a host of things while they're driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=814.422s">And</a> sometimes I'm in my car saying, please just drive your car because they'll be in the middle of the road, not moving while traffic's going around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=821.743s">It's,</a> it's just, it's, it's unbelievable in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=824.944s">And,</a> uh, I read an article, I think it was a month or two ago in the globe that the number of tickets issued, uh, we would think because we have the texting ban that there's a lot of tickets being issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=836.433s">It's</a> minimal, if many at all, in this commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=841.676s">And</a> one of the reasons is, like you mentioned, it's hard to pinpoint and catch someone in the act that could be dialing the phone, make a phone call, or so forth.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=851.643s">I</a> like the hands-free ban, although when you're talking, you can still get distracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=856.646s">But</a> if you're talking to a passenger, you can be distracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=859.208s">So</a> I think it's a step in the right direction to provide the safety we need on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=864.375s">So</a> Mr. President, if I can make that in the form of a motion, if we as a community can implement our own hands-free ban within the perimeter of our city.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1317.946s">Yeah,</a> resident permit parking.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1320.046s">It's</a> going to be enforced under this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1322.387s">Say</a> it again, it's what? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1323.087s">Resident</a> permit parking is part of the enforcement.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1767.182s">Through</a> you to actually the city clerk, why is it so expensive to get a copy of the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1773.725s">Is</a> it $20 to get a copy? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1777.127s">So</a> that was set by this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1779.128s">How</a> far back?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1791.953s">2000</a> maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1794.694s">What</a> would the actual cost be for the actual CD itself and the time?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1851.313s">It</a> just seems $20 seems a little excessive for someone to get a copy of a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1856.735s">Um,</a> also the meetings used to be, uh, copied onto the channel three website. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1862.256s">Uh,</a> and they did that for, geez, that's probably say close to a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1866.557s">And</a> then as we know, when channel three closed, that stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1869.598s">Uh,</a> and I'm thinking Mr. President, if there's a way to get it onto the city website, uh, the council has an area for, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1876.745s">the</a> city council that list all of us and our email addresses and so forth, and why can't we get a copy burned into the city website of taped council meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1887.313s">It's</a> a great way for access to residents, and we always talk about open government, and I think that would serve well for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1898.06s">So</a> I would offer that, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2122.792s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2123.693s">I</a> received an email a day or two ago regarding the mayor's new parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2130.8s">And</a> the woman asked me if the handicapped spots that are in our business districts and throughout our cities that are on also resident permit parking areas will remain the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2145.432s">Will</a> they be the same number of spots in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2149.154s">And</a> this paper is to ask the administration, where they are the ones that signed the contract and are most familiar with the contract, what is the <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2160.082s">proposal</a> call for regarding handicap parking and are there any changes to the number of existing spots that currently exist in our community, Mr. President?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2802.82s">I</a> don't know if my colleague misspoke, but I believe there's only gonna be 85 kiosks.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2808.621s">Okay,</a> you said 1,700.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2827.965s">It's</a> only a thousand spots.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3687.61s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3690.03s">I</a> don't want anyone out in the viewing audience to believe that the meters are where we're going to gain a lion's share of our revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3698.252s">If</a> you look at the revenue calculations that were presented to us, ticketing will derive two-thirds of the revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3706.815s">So</a> it's not the meters that are driving the revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3710.476s">It's</a> the ticketing that's driving the revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3712.836s">And,</a> you know, I agree with my council colleague, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3715.677s">When</a> we asked, when I say we, it was us and the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3719.557s">and</a> residents of this community asked for enforcement, our vision was to enforce existing signage throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3727.689s">That</a> was the vision that was out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3730.273s">And</a> then eventually, if you wanted to expand the program, you know, we refer to Somerville all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3735.38s">Their</a> program has been in existence for 30 years and has been tweaked and revised over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3742.222s">We're</a> starting off with a program that they want, the administration wants to be comparable to a program that's been in existence for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3750.324s">So</a> we're going from nothing to something. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3753.225s">It's</a> like going from zero to 50 in a matter of minutes in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3758.526s">And</a> I think there lies the problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3762.075s">I</a> would ask, because I don't think a lot of people in this community are aware of the revenue calculations, that if we can get a revenue comparison, Mr. President, on right now, if you want to feed the meter, it's a dollar for an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3777.664s">It's</a> 25 cents for every 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3780.466s">If</a> we were to lower that to 50 cents for an hour, what would the revenue projections be based on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3788.873s">with</a> a look at, as Mr. Pompeo mentioned, Stephen Pompeo from Pompeo Insurance and West Method, that we provide free parking citywide for the first 15 minutes or first half hour, how that impact the revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3804.704s">and</a> if we can get a comparison on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3807.286s">Because</a> if we're looking at ticketing driving two-thirds of the revenue, then if we were to provide 15-minute free parking citywide, the first 15 minutes, so if you want to run in and get a sandwich, or if you want to run in and get the newspaper, or pay a bill at a store, whatever you might want to do would cover a lot of people the first 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3827.22s">And</a> in my opinion, based on the revenue calculations that I saw, that would not <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3832.997s">hamper</a> revenue at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3835.599s">And</a> it would provide a service to everyone in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3838.441s">It</a> would address the business owners throughout the community, Mr. President, that have concern with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3843.345s">And</a> I think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3844.626s">So</a> I would ask my council colleague if we can amend his paper or add this, that a revenue calculation be done to compare parking for 50 cents for one hour as opposed to $1 for one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3861.927s">and</a> first 15 minutes free citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3865.869s">How</a> does that impact the proposal, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3868.81s">A</a> cost analysis comparison, I think, would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3872.392s">And</a> just my last point, Mr. President, you know, we all push for this, and, you know, we can be critical and so forth, and something needed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3883.177s">And</a> as I stated from the top, I'm not in support of a lot of these initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3887.759s">But</a> I think a telltale sign, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3890.822s">A</a> telltale sign is last week, the mayor had a State of the City speech before the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3899.305s">And</a> during his speech, he did not mention one word about parking enforcement, one of the biggest things to hit businesses in the last 50 years in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3913.45s">He</a> did not make one mention of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3915.971s">And</a> that to me is a telltale sign of this administration <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3920.13s">And</a> the fact that this administration, I don't even think, supports the plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3925.014s">And</a> what we're going to see when this plan finally gets implemented, and I agree with Councilor Dello Russo, there's not enough notification now, there should be public hearings and so forth, that when this program eventually hits, people in this community are going to be shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3943.688s">They're</a> going to be shocked, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3946.45s">And</a> no matter what we do for the first couple of weeks and <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3949.345s">give</a> out fake tickets and so forth, people are going to be shocked because the way of life in this community, the way of doing business in this community is going to be altered, in my opinion, negatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3961.507s">And</a> I think this should have been addressed in a different manner, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3965.828s">It</a> could have been addressed in-house, and it could have been much more thoughtful to take into consideration how this community works and the way of life in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3976.21s">And</a> then we could have proceeded from there, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4391.058s">That's</a> a great suggestion, but unfortunately the mayor already allocated $250,000 back to the business districts, so your resolution is moot right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4401.941s">You</a> said all revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4403.882s">He</a> already allocated money, so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4413.291s">I</a> agree with you.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4892.89s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4895.451s">Last</a> Friday, October 17th, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4898.832s">members</a> of the South Method residents together, better known as SMARTO, organized a public safety walk within their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4909.88s">I</a> just would like to thank Jim Silva, who is the organizer slash founder of SMARTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4917.165s">And</a> as we all know, behind this rail and many residents of South Method, that particular group has been instrumental in getting many initiatives from public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4928.361s">to</a> streets and sidewalks and a host of issues accomplished through togetherness and through unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4937.347s">And</a> on last Friday, Mr. President, there was roughly 30 residents that showed up for the walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4944.892s">The</a> walk was roughly a mile and a half through many streets in South Method, starting from the Yield Street parking lot and ending up at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4956.91s">and</a> back to the South Medford Business District. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4961.714s">The</a> meeting was attended by Chief Sacco, who was instrumental and lent his expertise on many of the issues that were raised that night by residents that joined the walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4975.045s">We</a> were also joined by several police officers who were assigned to the night shift in the South Medford neighborhood area so residents could see <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4984.94s">who's</a> actually patrolling the streets, meet them and say hi to them and see a familiar face, which was nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4992.183s">I</a> attended the walk along with Councilors Caraviello and Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4999.346s">As</a> I mentioned at the beginning, the issues that were raised were public safety in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5006.189s">There</a> were issues of concern with speeding on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5009.511s">There</a> was issues of break-ins. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5011.492s">There</a> were issues of different activity <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5015.186s">drug</a> activity, criminal activity taking place on our streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5020.888s">The</a> talk also went not only to public safety, but there was issues regarding DPW, the streetlights, many streetlights that were either dim or out altogether, which was brought up before this council several weeks back to improve lighting in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5041.336s">We</a> witnessed a number of double poles up and down the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5045.26s">that</a> we took and wrote notes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5049.462s">There</a> were also many, many tree stumps that still strewn throughout the sidewalks in South Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5058.246s">And</a> again, we witnessed firsthand traversing the sidewalks with curbs that are raised higher than the sidewalk or a little lower than the sidewalk, which is a trip and hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5068.571s">We</a> witnessed streets that were in awful deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5074.711s">to</a> walk on and to drive on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5078.633s">And</a> at that meeting, we took down a list of what you would refer to as a punch list of issues that needed to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5088.777s">This</a> is not a solve-all by any means, but a way of addressing individual needs from residents that showed up and neighborhood concerns that were in to Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5101.282s">Tonight,</a> I'd like to go through some of the punch list. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5104.795s">residents</a> from Salt Method here that would like to also speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5109.099s">And</a> in addition to the punch list, which I'm going to go through just briefly, and the residents can speak on it, I would like to personally propose, Mr. President, where this walk was such a success, and I think my colleagues would agree with me, and the neighbors would also agree, that we imitate this particular safety walk in other sections of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5133.124s">And</a> I reached out to Chief Sacco already, and he said he'd be willing to do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5138.908s">I</a> also mentioned to Chief Sacco that it was great to have the chief there, but because the issues involved other department heads also, and I didn't want the chief to be, you know, wearing too many hats, that we also invite for these particular walkthroughs in different neighborhoods, the police chief, the DPW commissioner, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5162.086s">code</a> enforcement, and the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5164.887s">I</a> think that probably covers the gambit of issues that were raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5168.528s">And</a> if anyone would like to invite anyone else, the chief so far, Sacco, said he was on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5175.79s">And</a> I would like to implement these through Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5179.631s">And</a> the one thing I'd like to try is that the city has the reverse 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5186.593s">It's</a> a great tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5188.033s">As</a> we all know, we receive two or three calls a week now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5191.802s">in</a> notifying residents on what's going on, different things in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5196.185s">And</a> I would ask for the administration, in cooperation with this council, to set up these particular meetings, because we can use the reverse 911 to contact neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5208.852s">So</a> if we wanted to, in a month from now, say we want to contact <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5213.158s">the</a> Haines Square area and do a walk-through in that particular area, it would literally take a five-minute phone call that's done by the police department to send out thousands of phone calls notifying residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5226.422s">I</a> think it's probably the most effective way of reaching everyone in the community that would have an interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5232.404s">And</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that we establish <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5236.005s">neighborhood</a> safety walks in every segment and every section of this community with the heads of the different departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5246.912s">And</a> that be done by a reverse 911 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5250.215s">And</a> if we want, we can meet with the administration to figure out a process to set this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5255.678s">But</a> in my opinion, until you walk the street, until you hear from the neighbors, I mean, we all get phone calls and emails, but it's really an eye opener. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5264.582s">when</a> you actually walk the street, and you see the different things, and you feel it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5269.324s">You</a> know, I don't live in the Salt Method neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5272.125s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5273.626s">When</a> you go down there and walk the streets, it's very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5277.567s">You</a> know, I'm in my neighborhood a lot, and I traverse the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5280.088s">But</a> until you actually get into the neighborhood, I think you feel the very foundation of what that neighborhood is all about, and hear from the residents firsthand on what their plight is, and what they're going through, and their issues <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5294.453s">of</a> concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5295.734s">And</a> I heard from several residents, which is troubling, Mr. President, that night that people are looking to move out of the community because they're disappointed with the lack of response from the city when they call on an issue, because they're disappointed that nothing seems to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5313.225s">And</a> that's very troubling to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5316.427s">And</a> I think it's something that we as a community have to work on and different initiatives, as Councilor Longo offered, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5323.847s">with</a> the 3-1-1 program and other initiatives to involve the community in a direct link into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5332.849s">But</a> if you would just indulge me, Mr. President, I'd like to just walk through the list briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5340.991s">And</a> I was hoping that we, as a council, some of these might be initiatives that we can push forward, and other initiatives maybe the SMARTO group will have to follow up and follow through with. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5353.496s">But</a> the first punch list was an issue with a curb cut at the corner of Yale and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5361.838s">As</a> we all know, I think we've all received phone calls from residents and so forth, and this has been an issue of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5367.839s">There's</a> trucks that are going over the curb, which is now a curb cut, an extended curb cut, I might add, and they hang out onto the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5377.842s">It</a> poses a real public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5380.442s">I'm</a> not sure, and the chief agreed, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5383.837s">how</a> this took place, when it took place, who approved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5388.338s">There</a> seems to be no record around of this particular curb cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5392.019s">But</a> the recommendation that I'm making tonight based on Smato's recommendation is that we close the curb cut at the corner of Yale and Main to prevent cars and trucks from parking next to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5408.703s">So</a> that would be the first one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5410.923s">And</a> I would hope that we as a council, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5413.669s">can</a> send that to the traffic commission with support of the council to close off that curb cut in regards to public safety for the neighbors of that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5426.012s">The</a> second one, well, the second one was the bollards, to install bollards on Main and Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5436.335s">And</a> as we all know, that's on the other end of where the Oasis Bakery is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5441.457s">That</a> also has been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5443.437s">We</a> were there last Friday night, and when we were crossing the street, some of us had to jump out of the way because there were cars coming up onto the sidewalk or backing out trying to get off the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5455.785s">And</a> it really was a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5458.567s">So</a> the second request, and we can send this to also the Traffic Commission and the DPW, is to install bullets at the corner of Harvard and Main next to <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5471.621s">and</a> along that corner where the Oasis Bakery is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5479.088s">Another</a> issue is in front of the Oasis, there's a bus stop that takes up several spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5486.414s">Many</a> residents of the community thought it would be a great idea if we were able to move the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5492.88s">I</a> know it's highly used. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5493.981s">Some</a> of the residents say, you know what, we really use this. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5496.824s">And</a> we said, we're not going to eliminate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5498.668s">We're</a> just going to shift it slightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5501.17s">And</a> we're going to shift it to the north corner of Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5505.634s">So</a> right now, it's in front of the Oasis restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5508.277s">We're</a> going to shift it to the north side, where the dry cleaner and the yoga establishment is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5513.822s">And</a> that will open up the section for delivery trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5519.664s">which</a> currently is one of the major problems in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5523.407s">There's</a> nowhere for delivery trucks to park, so they're going up onto the sidewalks, parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5528.47s">And</a> we witnessed it firsthand, and the residents witness it on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5533.594s">And</a> it's just a matter of time, honestly, before there's a public safety concern or a death in that area, and I hope we can prevent that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5542.341s">So,</a> my suggestion would be to move the bus stop from its current location, which would be a vote of this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5549.423s">of</a> the Oasis, which is in front of Oasis, and put it on the north side of Harvard in front of the dry cleaners and the yoga place. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5558.807s">And</a> in my opinion, that would lend itself to an area where trucks can park for delivery and also keep the bus stop in a reasonable manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5570.591s">It's</a> only maybe 30 feet or 40 feet from its existing stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5575.633s">So</a> I would ask that, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5578.907s">The</a> next one is to designate times for the loading zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5584.631s">It's</a> done in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5586.532s">If</a> we can have maybe loading zones between the hours of whatever it might be, 9 and 10 in the morning, or pick a particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5594.498s">Because</a> now trucks are coming, as we heard from residents, they're coming at 11 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5598.981s">They're</a> coming at 6 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5601.282s">And</a> when you hear the beeps and the backup noises that go on when trucks back up, it's a disturbance to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5608.261s">So,</a> the neighborhood would like to designate times for a loading zone in that particular section that I just referred to, which is hopefully the new truck delivery section, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5625.028s">The</a> pole five number of pole number 513 in front of Arthur's Bakery looks like it has a bird nest inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5633.491s">It's</a> completely dim. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5635.912s">And</a> as we all know, Arthur's Bakery is <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5638.163s">one</a> of the central businesses on Main Street, and that light needs to be fixed immediately in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5646.289s">So</a> I would hope that we could send that to the head of wires, Mr. President, as a recommendation from this council to have that light fixed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5656.798s">Also,</a> and I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing the cafe right, Daya, which is at the corner of Alexander and Main Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5667.164s">They</a> own the first, I think it's four or five feet, like all the businesses there, of sidewalk in front of their establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5675.328s">And</a> they have an area which is used for eating, which I think we all agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5681.311s">It's</a> a nice addition to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5683.051s">But</a> they built a little curbing around their eatery where you would eat on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5690.975s">And</a> if you go there at night, it's a trip and hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5694.297s">There's</a> no courting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5695.821s">off</a> right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5696.942s">It's</a> not fenced off at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5698.662s">It's</a> just the curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5699.943s">They</a> may be in the process of putting that there, but that definitely needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5704.965s">And</a> as a council, maybe we can have the administration or compliance or someone send an email or a letter to this particular establishment about
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5741.874s">That's</a> very important, thank you Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5744.576s">So</a> maybe if we can get an update for the area residents on what's gonna happen <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5749.484s">There</a> must be a plan on file with the city, and that's good news that it's being reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5755.886s">Also,</a> the sidewalk in front of LaCoste's Bakery, we stopped there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5760.247s">It</a> is completely crumbling and needs to be paved over in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5767.329s">The</a> trimming of bushes and improved lighting at Tufts Park entrance is a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5774.091s">The</a> bushes are overgrown and high and <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5777.773s">It</a> lends itself for a difficult area to traverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5781.856s">And</a> also, when we're up at Columbus Park, the walkway at Columbus Park has period lighting, like in the square, and many of the light fixtures are tarnishing and turning yellow, and they're not letting off enough light, and it's very dark in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5802.549s">So,</a> I would ask, Mr. President, we have members <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5806.478s">of</a> SMARTO in the neighborhood, South Medford neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5809.459s">They'd</a> like to come up and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=5811.08s">And</a> again, I'd like to thank all the neighbors and Jim Silva in particular for setting this up and for organizing it, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6733.606s">Just</a> if I could, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6735.347s">Maybe</a> if we can just go through them and take a vote by the council to refer them somewhere now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6741.608s">Some</a> of them and some of them we can decide what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6744.5s">The</a> curb cut closure at Yale and Maine, can we take a vote of the council to refer that to the traffic commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6752.561s">The</a> chief thought that was the appropriate place for them to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6757.302s">So</a> if we could take a vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6760.323s">To</a> the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6761.943s">Send</a> it to the traffic commission.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6765.424s">So</a> we'll want to take one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6768.264s">Yale</a> and Maine, the curb cut to the traffic commission, the bollards. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6772.846s">The</a> bullet's installed on the corner of Main and Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6777.133s">Same</a> thing, send it to the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6778.615s">Traffic</a> Commission.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6829.87s">So</a> those two will be sent, the curb cut and closure yield, and the bollards at the corner of Main and Harvard Street will be sent to the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6838.861s">The</a> merging of the bus stop, I think I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6841.222s">Maybe</a> we should have a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6845.003s">Transportation.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6845.843s">At</a> least have one meeting that's a major moving of a stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6849.765s">Transportation.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6899.453s">Actually,</a> it affects the commuters more than the business owners.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6918.084s">We'll</a> take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6918.764s">We</a> can always tweak it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6920.425s">We</a> can always tweak it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6934.47s">I</a> think we should wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6935.391s">If</a> we move the bus stop, then we can talk about the Loading Zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6937.912s">Does</a> that sound all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6940.072s">Committee</a> of the Whole discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6941.133s">If</a> one doesn't happen, the other one's not going to happen.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6972.171s">Councilor</a> Marks, your next item. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6974.192s">Next</a> one is poll number 513 in front of Arthur's Bakery. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6978.291s">The</a> light is dim or out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6979.951s">Can</a> we refer that to the superintendent of wires? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6983.192s">Poll</a> number 513 on main street in front of Arthur's bakery. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6986.793s">Uh,</a> the fence at the corner of Alexander and the calf council Dello Russo was gracious enough to let us know that the city administration along with the businesses are working on some something in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6999.055s">And</a> maybe if we can just get a report back, who's ever just report back to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7004.997s">It</a> was an OCD project. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7006.277s">OCD.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7006.457s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7007.53s">If</a> we can get a report back from OCD, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7009.63s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7009.93s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7011.451s">Um,</a> the sidewalk crumbling at the cautious bakery, if we can refer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7016.232s">And</a> also the trimming of the bushes, uh, and improved lighting at Tufts park to the DPW commissioner and, um, the lighting issue at Columbus pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7032.295s">If</a> we can refer that to the superintendent of wires, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7040.051s">And</a> then, Mr. President, if we could take a vote on a proposal that would be in cooperation with the mayor and this council to hold these public safety walkthroughs throughout the entire community, along with the appropriate department heads, and the use of the reverse 911 to notify residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7060.416s">I</a> think that would be worth its weight in gold if we could set something up like that.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7077.428s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7096.763s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7097.888s">create</a> a proposal where the mayor works with the city council in cooperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7102.53s">Who's</a> going to create this proposal?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7105.892s">Well,</a> we could do it in cooperation with the mayor so we can do a committee of the whole, however we want to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7110.994s">But,</a> um, I think it would only work with the administration being on board also.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7212.425s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7212.565s">Do</a> you want to speak more on this item? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7214.106s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7214.427s">After.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7216.208s">Yes,</a> I do.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7217.647s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7336.987s">Mr.</a> President, I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing that up on behalf of Mary, who's been very involved in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7345.208s">But</a> because it's Mystic Ave, I think we should also notify our state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7350.229s">There's</a> been a lot of issues, as you know, in that particular area, the crosswalks unpainted, the lighting's poor, the median strip. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7358.191s">You</a> know, there's been a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7360.411s">So</a> if we can involve our state delegation in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7364.452s">The</a> ironic thing is this <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7366.142s">the</a> state DPW yard right on Mystic Ave over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7370.687s">That's</a> the ironic thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7371.888s">And</a> unfortunately we can't get things resolved next to their own yard.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7498.551s">That's</a> not all of it.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7950.891s">Just</a> if I could, I think Maria is here to speak about her water bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7955.013s">Yeah,</a> we're going to get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7955.854s">No,</a> I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7956.314s">No,</a> but I think she's here to speak about her water bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7958.955s">She</a> saw the paper that was listed as unfinished business and it dealt with water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7964.698s">But</a> I don't think you're here to speak on that particular paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7967.7s">You</a> were here to speak on why your bill is so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7970.261s">Let's</a> take the vote on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7971.262s">I</a> think you're better off taking the vote on the paper and suspending the rule so she can... I mean, you already gave your statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7978.067s">Good</a> point, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7978.807s">But</a> it's not regarding this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7980.288s">It's</a> not here regarding this paper.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8037.627s">Salary</a> only. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8038.627s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8380.339s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8381.08s">If</a> you contact Fred Pompeo in the Treasurer's Assessor's Office, he'll refer to the site section of the law.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8664.566s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8665.746s">And</a> Marie, if I could, I know you, I remember it has to be eight years ago that you came before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8677.572s">And</a> at the time, uh, I believe it was right around when we were changing the meters and, um, you had a giant water bill that you got. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8685.053s">Um,</a> and you disputed it, I believe at the time with the water and sewer commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8690.274s">And,</a> um, I believe they replaced your meter back then.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8730.85s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8731.47s">But</a> at the beginning, you questioned why we bought new meters as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8736.152s">Yes,</a> I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8737.352s">And</a> if I could just state to you that back some 10 years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8741.918s">roughly</a> half the meters in the community were being estimated because they were malfunctioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8747.903s">So</a> when you estimate a meeting, it's someone at city hall saying, I believe based on what I'm looking at, that they consumed this amount of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8756.431s">Now</a> I, as a rate payer and a taxpayer, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8758.958s">I</a> don't want someone estimating my bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8760.679s">I</a> want actual usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8763.32s">So</a> we as a community knew that we had a problem with these meters that were 25 and 30 years old because they were the meters that were installed in our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8772.665s">Thought</a> it was best to move forward with meters that would be accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8776.827s">So</a> if you use X number, you pay for X number. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8779.769s">There's</a> no if, ands or buts about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8781.993s">That's</a> what you pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8783.074s">So</a> that's why the city had to move forward because we were estimating more than half the residents of this community that water bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8789.639s">And</a> in my opinion, that was unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8792.041s">The</a> second point is that this council has been pushing for an outside meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8797.785s">So</a> when you water your lawn, you don't have to pay a sewer cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8801.648s">Uh,</a> when you wash your car, you don't have to pay a sewer cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8804.15s">And</a> that was implemented back a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8807.072s">We</a> also, which we're going to meet under council longer current shortly, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8811.432s">is</a> we're going to create a new tiered system in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8814.733s">So</a> you're going to pay not the one water and sewer rate that you currently pay now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8819.915s">So</a> you pay the same water rate that Tufts University pays. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8825.357s">You</a> pay the same rate that the Budweiser plant pays. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8828.158s">Not</a> the same bill, the same rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8830.318s">And</a> what we said is it should be based on your consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8834.02s">So</a> if you're a high end user, you should pay more because you're taxing the system, you're using the system more. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8839.842s">You</a> should pay a higher rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8841.393s">So</a> the mayor hired a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8843.495s">He</a> sat down with the Water and Sewer Commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8845.576s">He's</a> been meeting off and on with the council, giving us some, how the project's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8851.34s">And</a> we're going to meet finally on this within the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8854.943s">But</a> what that's going to do is it's going to allow someone to conserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8859.466s">So</a> if your issue is that your bill is too high and you're paying too much, we know your meter's probably accurate now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8864.91s">It's</a> a new meter, and it's, you know, quite frankly, it's probably accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8868.255s">You'll</a> be able to have a direct impact on lowering your bill by doing whatever you can to conserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8874.418s">That</a> has never happened, really, in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8876.939s">And</a> your rate will be based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8878.78s">So</a> you'll end up paying a lower rate than you currently pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8882.221s">You</a> may have a savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8883.942s">And</a> just if I could, Mr. President, because you brought up so many valid points, I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8888.044s">The</a> $8.4 million, that's a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8890.925s">It's</a> excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8892.046s">Members</a> of this council have asked to offset the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8896.508s">So</a> whatever the rate goes up, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8897.944s">Like</a> this year, water is going up 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8900.405s">That's</a> not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8902.106s">That's</a> the MWRA charging us 9% more. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8906.689s">We</a> wanted to offset that rate so you would not get hit that additional 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8911.491s">So</a> we as a council recognize that with this surplus money, it should be used to offset rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8917.394s">It</a> should be used to do infrastructure improvements that could eventually lower your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8923.548s">You</a> know, right now, the infrastructure is crumbling under the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8927.45s">You</a> don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8928.711s">If</a> our sidewalks and streets are crumbling, can you imagine these pipes that are 90 years old under the ground?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8939.497s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8939.857s">And</a> it's called I&I, inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8943.158s">And</a> we're still dealing with that today, because we don't have a program in place to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8948.681s">So</a> every time it rains, we have water that's going into our outdated sewer pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8954.078s">And</a> it's going out to Deer Island, and it's being treated as raw sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8958.261s">That's</a> rainwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8959.142s">And</a> you're paying for it, and I'm paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8960.944s">We're</a> all paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8962.065s">But</a> this is what we need to use the surplus money to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8965.087s">And</a> in my opinion, the administration has fallen short to make these improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8971.372s">The</a> administration is at fault.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9012.486s">They</a> may not have sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9014.188s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9014.608s">So,</a> I mean, I think you have to compare apples to apples when you look at something and say, well, they're paying less than we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9020.953s">You</a> know, as I stated last week, believe it or not, it costs one cent to get a gallon of fresh drinking water to your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9031.04s">One</a> cent. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9034.343s">When</a> you state that, people are amazed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9036.324s">That's</a> what it costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9038.301s">But</a> I'm paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9039.182s">That's</a> the best buy in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9041.643s">One</a> cent to get a gallon of fresh drinking water to your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9045.847s">Can</a> they do better low in the rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9047.328s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9047.668s">I</a> agree with everything you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9049.389s">But</a> until the administration's changed, until something happens in this community, we're going to be seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9055.434s">It's</a> going to be Groundhog Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9056.855s">We're</a> going to revisit the issue over and over again.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10031.261s">Two</a> weeks ago, Mr. President, I asked for a complete audit of the finances that have been received to date regarding the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10040.643s">And</a> we have yet to receive a response on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10046.624s">Should</a> we send another question again? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10049.045s">Or</a> I'm not sure how long it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10052.845s">Yeah,</a> I'm not sure what the secret is of what the finances are on the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10057.726s">The</a> mayor has already publicly come out and said that <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10061.132s">J.F.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10061.532s">White</a> gave money for mitigation for the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10065.094s">There's</a> been fundraisers held in this community where residents have donated money towards a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10071.118s">And</a> I don't understand why we can't have transparency when we ask a question of where is the finance and how much money is in the account, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10080.744s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10082.405s">It</a> shouldn't take several weeks to get that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=10085.046s">So,</a> again, I ask respectfully, Mr. President, that requests go back out to the administration.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_SzZSQAzqgnA/2025-03-21_SzZSQAzqgnA.html">Medford City Council - October 14, 2014</a></h2>

prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=126.029s">And</a> they, at the meeting, and I won't speak on behalf of the police department, let residents know that this is an ongoing and active investigation that's taking place and that they're putting all their resources into finding out exactly what happened and that a step up in patrol was going to happen also within that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=149.028s">as</a> well as some recommendations that were offered by the chief about to increase lighting in certain areas in that particular vicinity, and also the fact that additional cameras within the police department would help to help solve some crime within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=171.945s">But,</a> Mr. President, I offer this resolution tonight because at the meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=177.31s">One</a> of the officers spoke up and directed his comments towards members of the city council, stating that it would be helpful, because other surrounding communities do it, if they could have what I would refer to as a revolving account that's within the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=195.164s">I</a> mean, the account, in my opinion, could be within DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=198.606s">It</a> could be here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=200.048s">But</a> to have a revolving account that <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=202.401s">Fines,</a> when people are caught doing graffiti, fines of whatever is issued will go directly into the revolving account and can only be used for appropriation to remove graffiti within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=220.154s">I</a> also had the opportunity to look at some of the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=224.644s">And</a> I noticed that the city of Somerville has a program which they handle similarly with an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=234.391s">But</a> they take it one step further on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=237.733s">They</a> also offer, which I'm going to add to my paper tonight, Mr. President, is that graffiti knows no age, no sex, no orientation, no, you know, people vandalize for whatever reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=254.016s">It</a> was mentioned that it's done on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=257.579s">As</a> we know, it's done on public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=260.021s">As</a> we experienced, it's done in parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=263.223s">And</a> it's done throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=265.305s">And</a> the fact that someone may tag a public building, it's easy to city contacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=270.449s">I</a> know in the past, Mr. President, you work at the sheriff's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=274.392s">They've</a> been gracious enough to come out with their itty graffiti machine and clean the graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=281.257s">But</a> if it's done on private property, some communities have city ordinances that require homeowners to remove the graffiti within a certain amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=294.822s">And</a> that adds insult to injury, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=297.943s">The</a> fact that you're at home, someone tags the outside of your vinyl siding, and the next day you receive a call from the city saying <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=308.1s">You</a> have 10 days to remove the graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=311.661s">You</a> may not have the means to remove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=314.902s">You</a> may need to have the graffiti remain on your house for a period of time for insurance purposes and a whole issue of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=324.505s">And</a> why I bring this up is the city of Somerville has a contract, and it's right on their website, and I have copies if anyone wants to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=334.196s">And</a> it's removal of graffiti agreement and release of liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=338.437s">And</a> I won't read it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=339.957s">It's</a> a page long. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=341.778s">But</a> it goes over the fact that if the city is willing to go onto private property and remove graffiti from the side of a home or a garage or wherever it may be, that the homeowner will hold the city free from liability, and they'll remove the graffiti at no expense to the homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=363.827s">And</a> I thought that's a great idea, Mr. President, to eradicate graffiti in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=371.434s">I</a> know the city of Malden also, just recently in March, they introduced a new service that they provide to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=384.664s">And</a> they modeled it after the city of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=387.987s">And</a> it's modeled after the Citizens Connect smartphone application. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=392.895s">that</a> the city of Boston currently uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=395.356s">And</a> Malden just started this in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=398.056s">And</a> they stated that, as an example, if a resident sees graffiti on the street, they would normally call or email the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=407.458s">Now</a> a resident can simply take a picture using their smartphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=411.259s">With</a> one click, the request is automatically sent to the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=415.4s">Once</a> the graffiti is removed, the resident is notified on their smartphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=419.417s">that</a> the issue has been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=421.959s">They</a> stated also in their press release, we are already seeing great results from the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=428.863s">Since</a> its release, we have had 576 requests to the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=433.866s">Not</a> all were graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=435.167s">These</a> are just requests to DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=438.389s">And</a> 543 were resolved with the balance slated for spring repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=443.913s">That</a> equates to 94% of all issues being resolved via the new application. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=449.281s">And</a> most were fixed within 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=452.343s">This</a> is a great, great application. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=454.845s">It's</a> a great way to connect residents of this community to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=460.629s">And</a> also, it goes on to say that they thanked, at the time, Mayor Menino and the city of Boston for their leadership on the initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=470.796s">And</a> also, which I found quite interesting, they thanked Governor Patrick and Lieutenant Governor Murray <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=477.682s">for</a> offering funding for the applications so communities could take advantage of this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=484.164s">So</a> apparently there's grants or money out there that we can obtain as a community to not only have a revolving account, which is my request, but to also implement something similar to this Connect phone, smart phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=499.748s">I</a> know Somerville uses, I think it's 311, Smart 311, I believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=509.248s">311</a> to allow residents to contact the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=514.592s">They</a> get a response back immediately saying that their request was accepted, the date and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=519.857s">And</a> then, within a period of time, they're contacted by the city with updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=525.841s">It's</a> just a great way of doing business. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=528.404s">And</a> I would ask, Mr. President, that we not only have the administration look into setting up a revolving account <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=537.291s">exclusively</a> for the purpose of graffiti removal in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=543.893s">We</a> also look into this particular Citizens Connect smartphone application to allow residents the expanded means of communicating with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=557.076s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I received a number of e-mails because of this resolution, and one resident who asked if they can appear before the council <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=567.716s">Couldn't</a> make it tonight, but will be before the council in the near future, is applying for a mural funding from the Medford Arts Council and also from the Senator Charles E. Shannon Community Safety Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=585.228s">And</a> from what I understand, it's going to be very similar to the mural at the Medford Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=590.712s">And</a> they're looking to put a mural. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=592.713s">I</a> don't want to let the cat out of the bag, because this woman has done a lot of work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=597.623s">But</a> somewhere in South Bedford, they already received approval for a mural. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=602.025s">And</a> this, in my opinion, will go a long way to covering up a wall that is typically, this particular wall that she's referring to, has been tagged a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=614.25s">And</a> it will go a long way to beautifying the area and also making it less inviting for someone to come out and use that to tag Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=624.534s">So</a> I would ask that the paper be amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=627.082s">to</a> include the expansion and implementation of the Citizens Connect smartphone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=635.165s">And</a> I look forward to the mayor's response on this.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1998.332s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1999.813s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2003.515s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2007.645s">just</a> read over the email that we all received, too, regarding the mayor signing the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2015.171s">And,</a> you know, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that in the mayor's opening statement, he said the city's goal is to provide the best possible parking experience for its citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2029.201s">And</a> you would think, Mr. President, over the last several years that this would have been a goal of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2036.506s">There</a> was a spotlight, I believe it was done by Channel 5 about six months ago regarding the lack of enforcement for resident permit parking in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2047.072s">It</a> didn't exist at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2049.274s">So</a> at that point, the mayor wasn't trying to provide the best experience for citizens in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2056.458s">He</a> also said in his statement that the objectives of this program are to deter illegal parking, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2064.192s">to</a> ensure timely turnover of parking spaces, to benefit and enhance the business districts, and to create a friendly environment for consumers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2073.658s">Mr.</a> President, what was asked for back in 2009 was to enforce existing signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2084.185s">That</a> was the recommendation back in 2009, to enforce existing signage and be consistent <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2092.52s">which</a> never took place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2095.16s">So</a> if we had consistent enforcement throughout the community, there would be no need to hire an outside company from Tennessee to outsource it to Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2107.343s">We</a> all know the contract is based on performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2111.923s">And</a> that will result, not could, it will result in very aggressive ticketing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2121.761s">it</a> will result in aggressive ticketing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2126.505s">So</a> if the mayor was really intent on putting the best possible parking experience for citizens, all along, he would have provided consistent enforcement by our own in-house personnel to move these cars along. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2144.278s">I</a> agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2146.399s">However,</a> I don't agree with hiring an outside company, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2152.183s">It</a> also goes along to state that one of the benefits of this particular program, and I'll quote it, it says, the chamber also acknowledged that there are several beneficial aspects of the plan, such as the user-friendly kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2172.091s">I've</a> been talking to residents, I've been talking to business owners throughout the community, it's a hot topic, and I haven't heard one resident so far say, you know what, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2181.397s">I</a> don't mind getting out of my car in West Method, walking four or five car lengths, which may even be a little further because there's hydrants and there's bus stops and everything else within this community crosswalks, putting my plate in the kiosk, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2201.291s">putting</a> my time in the kiosk, putting my money in the kiosk, and going in the West Method Spa and getting a newspaper and going back to my car. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2210.438s">I</a> haven't heard one resident say that they feel that's a benefit, that they feel that that's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2217.816s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2218.556s">So,</a> I'm not quite sold on the use of kiosk on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2223.697s">I</a> don't know any other community in this surrounding area that use kiosk on the streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2230.039s">I</a> don't believe it's user-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2231.879s">And</a> I believe, as was mentioned at our meeting a couple of weeks ago, that if you happen to be stopping in one of our business districts and you happen to have your kids with you, or you happen to be taking your elderly mother to a doctor's appointment, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2246.967s">It's</a> not user-friendly to walk several spots to put money in a kiosk, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2253.35s">It</a> was also mentioned that the mayor was willing to settle or compromise with the business community in giving free spots throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2266.976s">And</a> that was very admirable of the mayor, but let's break it down for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2273.834s">This</a> plan calls for 1,000 parking spots, roughly 1,000 parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2280.376s">The</a> mayor, under his new proposal that he just signed, is allotting two parking spots for 30-minute free parking in five of the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2291.0s">So</a> that's 10 spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2292.661s">That's</a> 1% of the total parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2297.243s">So</a> this great, grandioso plan that the mayor came down and <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2301.297s">decided</a> with the business owners who were all advocating for some sort of free parking, albeit limited free parking, but some sort of free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2311.427s">Now,</a> the mayor was gracious enough to give us 10 spots citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2318.493s">So</a> if you happen to be in Method Square, there may be a spot down by the CVS, down by Carlene's. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2326.966s">And</a> there may be a spot on the east side, all the way down by City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2333.01s">Those</a> are your two spots for free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2336.933s">Doesn't</a> seem like a lot to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2340.215s">And</a> I don't think it's what the business owners intended on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2345.778s">Secondly,</a> Mr. President, this council asked several times, and recently a couple of weeks ago, to hold a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2355.916s">to</a> allow residents, business owners, anyone interested to come up and address the council, address the mayor, address the administration, address this company from Tennessee, and the mayor refused to hold a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2370.104s">He</a> kept on going back saying, don't forget, there was a public hearing in September 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2375.167s">Mr.</a> Mayor, that was five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2381.926s">Things</a> change in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2383.807s">There</a> are new residents in this community over the past five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2387.269s">There</a> are new business owners in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2389.65s">There</a> are new challenges facing our residents and our business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2394.152s">And</a> to go based on a hearing that took place five years ago, the mayor must have his head stuck in the sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2403.637s">So</a> there was no input from this council, and I speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2409.309s">And</a> I'd like to know if any member of this council was able to effectively make change in the mayor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2416.385s">I'd</a> like to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2418.151s">Because</a> every time I offered something, the mayor just poo-pooed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2422.796s">Oh,</a> that can't be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2423.716s">We</a> can't do it like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2425.238s">This</a> was the mayor's proposal from the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2428.941s">No</a> one had any input, the business owners, nor the residents of this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2435.308s">I</a> know the mayor, in his statement, keeps on going back, saying the business owners and the chamber are on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2441.093s">What</a> about the 56,000 residents of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2445.735s">What</a> input do they have? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2447.436s">They're</a> the ones that traverse the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2449.997s">They're</a> the ones that go to the schools and the churches and the medical appointments in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2456.579s">Why</a> do they have no input, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2460.321s">You</a> know, I don't know why the mayor decided to craft this program in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2470.165s">He</a> crafted it, as he stated three weeks ago, with members of his departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2476.569s">That</a> who has ultimately made the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2480.312s">Members</a> of his department heads made the decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2485.495s">And</a> then once the program went out for RFP, request for proposal, and came back, the mayor was about to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2493.54s">And</a> he thought better of it and said, let me have the council do a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2499.056s">where</a> business owners came down, the ones that did know about it came down, and they offered many suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2507.362s">And</a> I talked to a business owner tonight that was at that meeting, not gonna state his name, and he wasn't aware of the mayor just signing this, but I asked him, is that acceptable, two spots? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2519.051s">And</a> he said, absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2521.754s">And</a> he thought he was gonna have some input. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2524.977s">And</a> he had no input at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2526.598s">So</a> I don't know who the mayor met with, as Councilor Penta mentioned, but this was a decision made strictly by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2536.166s">If</a> the mayor was so concerned about providing such an experience for parkers in this community, why did he let resident permit parking go for so many years without enforcement? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2549.537s">But</a> he collected the fee for the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2552.74s">He</a> didn't let that go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2554.619s">He</a> made sure he collected the fee, but he didn't provide the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2558.522s">The</a> mayor allowed people to park from Winchester and Arlington and West Bedford for years and take the commuter rail in, and take the buses in. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2568.128s">He</a> allowed them to park in Bedford Square and Haines Square for years, Mr. President, without enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2575.273s">So,</a> you know, I'm not sold on this program, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2579.396s">Councilor</a> Caraviello just mentioned the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2583.497s">retired</a> police officers possibly doing the role in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2588.038s">I</a> offered back some years ago, Mr. President, to look at having crossing guards who I spoke to the union president, said they would be more than happy to do that task. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2600.681s">They</a> already have uniforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2602.741s">Many</a> of them are already trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2604.742s">And</a> at the time, it just fell on deaf ears to take this in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2612.711s">The</a> mayor went off, signed it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2614.712s">I</a> wish him well on this, but I wish there were more public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2620.355s">I</a> wish that there was more input from the community and from business owners in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2626.799s">And</a> I wish we had some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2627.98s">We</a> waited this many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2630.241s">I</a> wish we had some time to really sit behind the table like we did a few weeks ago and really iron out some of the differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2638.766s">And</a> we really didn't have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2641.525s">And</a> I think the mayor fell short of the mark on this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2645.647s">And</a> it's going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2647.909s">At</a> some point, when the aggressive enforcement starts, it's going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2652.792s">And</a> the mayor is going to do everything he can to hide behind the issue, like he did in this letter, stating, if you read half the letter, half it's about the council votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2665.199s">What</a> member behind this reel voted on the proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2668.493s">We</a> voted to allow the mayor to enter into a 10-year contract because of state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2675.796s">My</a> vote wasn't predicated on what was involved within that proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2681.294s">My</a> vote was to allow them because all three bids came back for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2685.835s">So</a> at the time, the mayor presented it to us saying, I can't negotiate at all because I don't have the authority to go and negotiate anything over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2694.658s">You</a> have to give me the ability to negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2697.259s">And</a> that's what this council did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2699.56s">We</a> never voted on the terms of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2703.021s">Not</a> one time did we ever vote on the terms of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2709.003s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3107.079s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3108.019s">And</a> I appreciate Mr. White being here on behalf of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3112.461s">You</a> just mentioned that you've participated in the process all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3117.242s">Other</a> than the meeting we had a few weeks back, Jonathan, what other participation has the chamber had in crafting this particular proposal?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3275.59s">So</a> just so I understand, if he was <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3277.81s">The</a> mayor was consulting with the past executive director. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3281.772s">Why</a> were so many business owners caught off guard of what actually was in the proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3287.554s">And</a> I'm not quite sure that I buy the fact that the chamber has had so much input in this proposal because the input really didn't take place until three and a half, four weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3303.309s">And</a> as you mentioned, this has been a process since 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3305.89s">This</a> has been an ongoing process for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3308.991s">So</a> I guess why all of a sudden in the last three weeks was it that the chamber was invited to the table to give input when supposedly there was open dialogue and input from <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3322.274s">the</a> chamber for the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3323.935s">I</a> don't understand why he took such a direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3327.298s">If</a> there was that much input for the last five years from the chamber, I would have think some of the issues would have been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3333.843s">And</a> really, the issues that I hear from business owners weren't addressed, still really aren't addressed, but weren't really talked about until three weeks ago.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4278.717s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4280.879s">For</a> those that are not aware, there are many petitions circulating the community right now for support. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4289.028s">of</a> a dog park in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4292.331s">We</a> were promised back in 2011 by the mayor that he was going to implement a dog park somewhere within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4303.719s">And</a> I am asking now for a complete itemization of the money that the mayor supposedly accepted from J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4313.506s">White</a> bridge construction, which was mitigation money. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4317.578s">back</a> in, I believe, 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4318.939s">And</a> also, September 2010 was the Medford Jingle Bell Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4327.141s">They</a> had a dog show and raised money for the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4330.942s">Also,</a> the Doggie Fun Run at Hormel Stadium, which was in 2013 and just recently held in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4339.774s">14,</a> and also the Boston Volunteer Solutions Incorporated donated $1,766 to develop a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4348.881s">And</a> I would like a complete itemized list of the different groups and organizations that have donated the money, when it was donated, and how much is in that account as it currently exists, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4406.409s">I</a> just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for those kind words. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4410.55s">And,</a> Mr. President, you know, I recognize, and I think many people behind this reeling, because we've all supported it, the fact that there's a need in this community, the fact that we have space in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4422.964s">The</a> fact that money's been raised in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4426.485s">And</a> I think all three combine to a reason why we need this park. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4430.947s">And</a> I, as one person, believe that we can no longer wait for this in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4438.249s">It</a> was promised back three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4440.25s">It's</a> a great way to exercise, socialize your dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4443.771s">People</a> meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4444.551s">You</a> know, Somerville last year licensed over 7,000 dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4451.621s">in</a> Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4452.622s">Method</a> licensed, I believe it was about 425, 400 dogs in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4455.826s">So</a> I think it shows you, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4463.848s">When</a> you have a community that has support for a dog park, support for initiatives like that, that people come out, they'll license their dogs, they'll get active, and that's healthy in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4477.559s">And</a> I think other surrounding communities that do have dog parks, Melrose, Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, Brookline, Arlington, Malden, Billerica, that have dog parks experience this, and our residents, I believe, are losing out on this experience as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4493.134s">the</a> need to exercise their dogs, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4542.248s">Anyone</a> interested in passing out petitions or putting them in businesses can contact myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4549.2s">or,</a> you know, maybe do it collectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4552.921s">Any</a> Councilor, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4553.981s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4554.181s">I</a> mean, you know, we're, we're trying to organize and like Council Knight said, it's grassroots and it's very difficult to get the list of, we did get a list of everyone that pulled the dog license. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4566.704s">We're</a> in the process of trying to contact people and eventually where the hopes are, Mr. President, that we're going to present all these petitions on a dog rally here at city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4578.061s">And</a> hopefully we'll have enough interest and enough participation to show the mayor that this is something, and I think the mayor agrees, but he's working slowly on it, that there's a need out there, and the need is eminent, and there's no reason to wait.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6070.132s">Councilor</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6071.833s">Mr.</a> President, I thank my Councilor colleague for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6075.116s">And</a> I think actually Councilor Knight hit the nail on the head on the fact that the ball's in our court. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6082.502s">And</a> if we want to have a public hearing here, if we want to have a committee of the whole meeting, if we want to have a subcommittee meeting, I personally prefer the fact that the Water and Sewer Commission has come up before the podium, as was just stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6094.444s">and</a> present to us the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6096.985s">Because</a> honestly, I think we've all advocated for a tiered system for a number of years, and I wasn't aware that potentially they would mesh, if you live in a three-family, all three together, and then they would divide by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6112.512s">I</a> wasn't aware it would work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6114.093s">But</a> these are the things I think that we have to listen to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6117.374s">And</a> regarding where the tier falls, if it's 0 to 800, or 800 to 1600, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6123.792s">At</a> any point you decide on, there's going to be a cutoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6126.774s">So</a> if it was zero to 1,000, what about the people that are 1,001? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6132.257s">So</a> I don't think you can really go too much on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6135.499s">And</a> as was mentioned, the tier system that we push for as a council, and don't forget, the council also pushed for, and it's been implemented, a second meter outside to save on your sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6148.907s">That</a> was another initiative by this council pushing <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6152.504s">I</a> think the TAD system will eventually promote, as was mentioned, conservation in the community, but also make people mindful of the fact, because the water and sewage, you feel like you have no control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6166.984s">Let's</a> face it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6168.335s">You</a> go to the restroom, you've got to flush your toilet. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6170.976s">You've</a> got to take a shower. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6171.856s">You've</a> got to drink water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6173.357s">You've</a> got to wash your lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6176.338s">There's</a> basic things that you need to do with water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6179.799s">And</a> this is the first time that someone may have control over what their bill is actually going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6186.321s">So</a> if you wanted to conserve and fall into a different range, then you could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6192.042s">You'd</a> make every effort to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6194.683s">And</a> I think we'll end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6197.751s">saving</a> as Councilor Knight mentioned in the long run, people money, save money in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6203.354s">And</a> the fact that we have, as Councilor Penta just mentioned, $8 million, I am shocked to hear $8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6208.716s">I</a> know it was $6.5 million or right around $6 million not too long ago, but that account is growing exponentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6216.06s">You</a> know, every member of this Council has stated <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6220.343s">That</a> count was never intended to be this pot of gold, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6225.269s">It's</a> for infrastructure improvements and to offset water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6229.755s">And</a> God knows we need a lot of infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6234.704s">You</a> know, the water and sewer that's, the water that's seeping into our old drain pipes, our old sewer pipes, that's costing us millions of dollars to treat as raw sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6244.746s">As</a> Councilor Penton mentioned, INI, the, I mean, the leak detection program, that's also costing the rate payers of this community millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6254.668s">These</a> are the things that that $8 million should be going into. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6258.488s">We</a> have illegal catch basins right now that are directly connected to the sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6263.376s">So</a> when it rains, that water goes out, and it's just groundwater, and it's treated as raw sewage, costing us millions of dollars a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6272.925s">We</a> know where these catch basins are. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6274.786s">We</a> have $8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6276.508s">Why</a> aren't we doing anything to improve the infrastructure, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6280.37s">This</a> has been a bone of contention that I've spoken about for years, Mr. President, and now we have money sitting in a fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6288.475s">Why</a> don't we use it for infrastructure improvements? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6290.916s">I</a> know some attempts have been made, and we've made some progress in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6296.261s">of</a> improving inflow and infiltration and also leak detection. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6300.882s">But</a> at the rate we're going, we're never going to get ahead of the bell curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6304.663s">We're</a> never going to get ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6306.524s">And</a> residents are going to be looking at their bills saying, someday this is going to be more than my tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6311.905s">And</a> the way we're going, this is not my statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6314.526s">It's</a> been stated 100 times before this council that someday your water and sewer bill <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6320.796s">will</a> be more than your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6322.497s">And</a> people will be looking to point the blame. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6325.478s">And</a> all they can point to that is the fact that we've done very little as a community to improve our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6332.241s">We've</a> done very little to improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6334.402s">We</a> do take advantage of 0% finance loans every so often and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6339.164s">But</a> we're never going to get ahead of the hundreds of miles of pipe that exist underneath our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6346.331s">unless</a> we start being proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6348.433s">Every</a> year, take up a certain hotspot. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6350.995s">We</a> know the hotspots are where there's a lot of leakage and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6354.359s">We</a> know where the hotspots are that are accepting groundwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6357.962s">We</a> know where the leaks are. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6359.443s">We</a> know where all the issues stand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6363.047s">However,</a> because it's underground, you know, out of sight, out of mind, the old saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6368.132s">You</a> know, the administration tends to put that on the back burner. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6371.34s">And</a> they like to have that little nest egg out there so they can say, well, our bond rating is low because we have these reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6378.786s">I</a> don't think we should be using the rate payers' reserves out there if we're not going to the intended purpose, which is infrastructure improvements and to lower the rates, just to say we can get a better bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6390.355s">That's</a> not the intent of that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6392.847s">And</a> the intent is definitely not to build an $8 million surplus on your hard-earned money, Mr. President, my hard-earned money, and every other taxpayer in this community that's working to make a buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6403.433s">We</a> should be holding $8 million in reserve, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6406.494s">I</a> thank my colleague, Councilor Penta, for bringing this up.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7096.23s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7096.791s">Also,</a> in addition to the city solicitor, can we also invite the city engineer at the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7102.672s">And</a> did you mention Councilor Penter as the chair?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7108.887s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7109.308s">I</a> would ask the chair then if, uh, I think you would need at least two hours in a meeting like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7114.811s">Uh,</a> cause I think sometimes in an hour you're hard pressed to get the questions and answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7121.076s">And,</a> uh, so I would ask that, uh, if my colleague would try to plan a two hour meeting on a Wednesday night.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7145.041s">He's</a> a paid consultant, so I think we're going to- Well, he came up with the rates, I'm sure, so.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7170.804s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7193.07s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7194.611s">These</a> were two separate <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7196.127s">trip-and-fall</a> accidents on Carolina Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7200.43s">One,</a> the woman was taken to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7202.711s">She</a> broke her nose. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7204.252s">She</a> did some damage to her jawbone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7206.754s">And</a> the other woman fell down. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7208.095s">I</a> believe had some leg damage, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7211.197s">But</a> both sidewalks are above, actually, the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7217.101s">So</a> when you step up onto the sidewalk, you hit the lip of the sidewalk, rather than just go onto a flat plane. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7226.002s">And</a> they really, in the interest of public safety, need to be done immediately, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8366.602s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8368.263s">As</a> we all know, and Jean's been very vocal over the years, Jean has been a staunch advocate of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8375.307s">So</a> even though her statements went in many different directions, I think where it lies with Jean is <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8381.8s">She's</a> always been a supporter of public safety and the men and women in the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8386.142s">Also,</a> Mr. President, while we have her here, and I know it's getting late, but Jean has attended a meeting in Washington and has done yeoman's work on all sorts of disability issues and VA issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8401.45s">And</a> I'd like to hear- Councilor Marks?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8417.067s">I</a> just would like, Mr. President, if Jane could fill us in on her endeavors with the VA and the disabilities and what she just recently did in Washington.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8620.405s">Mr.</a> President, I just would like to thank Jean on behalf of all Method residents for her work and diligence with the DAV and all the great things that she does. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8631.408s">That</a> was very interesting to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8632.708s">Thank</a> you, Jean.<h2><a href="../2013-06-05_LlmLze0ItRE/2013-06-05_LlmLze0ItRE.html">May 28, 2013 City Council of Medford, Massachusetts Full upload of complete council meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=386.104s">Mr.</a> President, uh, you know, year after year after year, we speak about this time of the year about repainting our crosswalks, which is a major public safety issue in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=397.702s">year</a> after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=399.022s">Some</a> years, it takes several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=401.423s">Some</a> years, it takes just a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=404.724s">You</a> know, Mr. President, it would only make sense from a standpoint of public safety in our community to install thermoplastic crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=415.066s">Painted</a> crosswalks last one year, if that, and then you're back again painting them immediately if you get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=423.442s">Thermoplastic</a> crosswalks, their life expectancy is three to five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=429.887s">They're</a> highly reflective, much better than paint, so you can see them from a distance when you're driving, and you can see if someone's in the crosswalk from a distance, and they're slip resistant also. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=440.977s">We</a> wouldn't have to discuss these issues every single year, when are we gonna get out and paint? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=447.042s">We</a> gotta get our whole crew at DPW out to paint the crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=451.271s">Wouldn't</a> it be more efficient, not only for public safety reasons, but more efficiency to have a crosswalk painted once every five years rather than five times? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=461.798s">It</a> doesn't make any sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=464.18s">It</a> really doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=466.281s">Thermoplastic</a> crosswalks are a little more expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=470.08s">But</a> you know what, the state uses them on the highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=472.601s">They</a> use them for a reason, because studies have been done to say this is a far better way of marking intersections and crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=480.403s">And</a> if we're really all interested about truly public safety concerns, we would all be pushing for thermoplastic crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=488.765s">And</a> we wouldn't have to talk for another five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=491.966s">But</a> year after year after year, it gets brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=494.868s">We</a> hope the city gets out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=496.41s">And</a> then we find out there's 40 in this area that weren't done, another 40 in this area, another 40 in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=503.335s">And</a> then we do a piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=504.856s">And</a> by the time we're done with them, the snow starts to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=508.439s">That's</a> what happens every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=510.321s">I</a> don't know what it's going to take to get a handle on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=513.624s">It's</a> no secret, Mr. President, thermoplastic has been in existence for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=518.905s">Federal,</a> state highways, they all use thermoplastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=522.627s">Painting</a> is a thing of the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=525.909s">It's</a> almost as bad as marking your streets that need to be swept with paper pamphlets. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=531.973s">It's</a> almost as archaic as marking your streets with paper pamphlets when you have to do street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=538.342s">So</a> I don't know, Mr. President, maybe we should be putting a resolution together as a council saying, you know what, Mr. Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=544.988s">We</a> want to see, if it's too late this year, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=548.771s">The</a> budget's coming up very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=551.153s">We're</a> going to start discussion budget in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=555.076s">We</a> should be pushing for thermoplastic crosswalks if there's a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=560.461s">associated</a> with you, I know there's a cost associated with it, that should be in the budget and then we won't have to discuss public safety issues year after year and we can focus our time on issues of importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=571.736s">Well,</a> safety is important, but when you have your crosswalks painted, then you can look, with thermoplastic, then you can look at other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=578.198s">You</a> don't have to keep on refocusing your attention on the same issue year after year after year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=584.521s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=585.181s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=788.84s">I</a> just want to mention what my colleague mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=791.441s">The</a> pilot program is for raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=794.543s">I'm</a> mentioning about thermoplastic crosswalk, which is very different than a raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=799.106s">Although</a> I support both initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=801.127s">Just</a> want to set the record straight on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=804.049s">Mr.</a> Clerk, call the roll.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=908.941s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=910.282s">Uh,</a> at this weekend's memorial, uh, ceremony, I had a resident come up to me and hand me a list of, uh, 13 names of just residents in his area, uh, of people that support a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=923.992s">And,</a> um, if you look at the list, Mr. President's Lowell court, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=928.258s">Rockwell</a> Ave, Pool Street, Evans Street, Middlesex Ave, Chipman, Burnside, Lawrence, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=939.172s">Hurlcroft,</a> Spring Street, Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=942.474s">These</a> are residents, Mr. President, name and phone number of people that support a dog park just in a small general area off of Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=951.34s">A</a> small area that this gentleman went out and just got a number of signatures of people that support a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=957.123s">You</a> can take this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=958.644s">and</a> a hundred fold throughout the community, people are wondering where this dog park is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=963.587s">It</a> was several weeks ago that I offered a resolution and Mr. Clerk, I don't know if it's been answered or not by the mayor, asking for the status of the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=972.073s">Where</a> is the dog park? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=973.374s">I</a> don't believe we got a response back from the mayor and that was voted on this council, by this council, seven weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=981.355s">I</a> don't know what's happening, but if the mayor's gonna make statements that he received mitigation and what the mitigation is and so forth, then at the very least, residents should hold him accountable to what was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=998.258s">If</a> part of the mitigation for the Bridge Fast 14 project was a dog park, then where is the dog park? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1007.341s">Is</a> there a location, Mr. Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1009.666s">Who's</a> working on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1010.647s">Did</a> you create an advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1012.892s">What's</a> going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1013.793s">All</a> we want is a status. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1015.834s">I</a> know things don't happen overnight, but all we want is a status. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1019.796s">So</a> for those thousands of pet owners in this community that want a place that their dog can run free, because that's what a dog park is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1027.261s">When</a> you take your dog to a local park now, they have to be leashed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1031.583s">They</a> can't run free. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1033.084s">This</a> would be similar to the dog park that's in Somerville, the dog park that's in Cambridge, and all the surrounding communities that do have currently dog parks right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1042.049s">This</a> would allow them to exercise and run their dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1046.172s">We're</a> not asking for anything other than what the mayor said he negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1053.216s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5897.921s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5898.642s">Council</a> Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5900.29s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5901.311s">And</a> I appreciate what Carol Rosen had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5905.353s">A</a> lot of that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5907.274s">However,</a> in order to accomplish some of what Carolyn spoke about, you need to have seven independent Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5916.179s">And</a> that's key to the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5918.961s">If</a> people aren't going to be independent behind this reeling, then it does break down to just a political process. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5928.49s">Does</a> the mayor have his votes? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5929.711s">And</a> then he pushes his initiatives through. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5932.252s">You</a> know, tonight, Councilor Penta mentioned to the mayor at the very end, I don't know if anyone else heard, Councilor Penta asked, he said, Mr. Mayor, because this project now, you're asking for an additional million dollars, I'd like for you to sit down and create a priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5947.201s">Is</a> that what you stated, Councilor Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5950.503s">And</a> the mayor said, I'm not gonna sit down and put together a priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5954.546s">He</a> said, we can afford to do everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5957.23s">That's</a> exactly what the mayor said. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5959.712s">We</a> can afford to do everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5961.994s">So</a> it's great, Carolyn, I can agree with what you're saying, the fact that we need to sit down and so forth, but if you have the mentality that we're hearing from the administration that there's no priority list, there's no list based on what we can afford to do, because according to the mayor, we can afford everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5984.36s">And</a> not only can we afford everything, we can afford to do it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5989.081s">Not</a> that we should have done it over the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5992.422s">You</a> know, when the DPW building was condemned years ago, the police station has been a pit for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6000.945s">A</a> pit for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6002.245s">The</a> high school pool's been down for seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6006.867s">And</a> the associated cost we heard about, the additional 1.2 million, was further deterioration. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6014.67s">So</a> because we didn't do, as you mentioned, Councilor Caraviello, why don't we do this seven years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6018.592s">Because</a> we waited, it cost us an additional several hundred thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6023.354s">And</a> as Carolyn mentioned, and I mentioned it last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6027.876s">Well,</a> that was part of it, was further deterioration. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6030.517s">Also</a> inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6032.698s">Now</a> there's an inflationary index regarding construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6036.78s">So</a> if the mayor took the cost from a 2007 architectural report that was established saying the report's gonna <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6044.102s">uh,</a> the pool is going to cost us 2.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6046.423s">The</a> mayor could have looked up the index. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6047.864s">I've</a> got someone in the building department look up the cost of construction work done in 2007 compared to construction work done in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6055.949s">And</a> he could have said, counsel, I know the figure has increased by three, $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6061.413s">Now</a> that's still not an exact figure, but I know there's an additional three or 4,000, three or $400,000 built into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6070.018s">But</a> when he came to us several months back, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6072.833s">As</a> I stated to the mayor tonight, one of the first questions, Mr. Mayor, you originally asked us for $2.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6078.817s">And</a> at the time, you knew there was accessibility issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6082.3s">At</a> the time, you knew there was inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6084.341s">You</a> knew all this already, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6086.262s">Why</a> would you come to us for $2.3 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6089.144s">And</a> he said there was no way of figuring this out until a secondary report was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6096.99s">And</a> the only thing I can think of now is, we're all on board with the DPW yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6102.0s">Is</a> that the figure that we voted on? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6104.582s">Is</a> that the figure that we're going to end up costing for the DPWR? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6108.865s">Or</a> is it going to be double or triple that? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6111.387s">Because</a> that seems to be the process how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6118.092s">I</a> don't know how every other entity and every other company and business and municipality does it, but it just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6127.659s">as</a> someone was quoted in the paper saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6129.86s">You</a> know what, Mr. Mayor, if that wasn't a fair and accurate estimate, then why give one? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6136.364s">Why</a> come out? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6138.645s">Because</a> it was the politically correct thing to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6142.408s">Come</a> out ahead of time and say, okay, we got the pool on target now, and I'll go back and get a million dollars somewhere down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6150.472s">We</a> heard that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6152.113s">We</a> were told by the administration tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6155.219s">that</a> once we do the pool, spectators, mothers, fathers, grandparents, sisters, brothers, can't watch their kid swimming and meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6164.024s">There's</a> nowhere for spectators to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6167.846s">It's</a> such a beautiful facility once it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6170.707s">There's</a> nowhere for spectators to sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6173.568s">And</a> we heard from the mayor, which is par for the course, we'll handle that after. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6179.071s">We'll</a> take care of that after. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6181.553s">similar</a> to the field of dreams and the accessibility issue at the field of dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6186.317s">We'll</a> make it accessible after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6188.199s">We</a> all know what happened with the field of dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6191.782s">You</a> can't continue to operate a city in this fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6196.086s">And</a> I agree with councilor Penta, you know, we've been asking for this priority list for a long time now, several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6204.414s">And</a> finally the mayor came out with chart the course. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6208.134s">And</a> he gave us a list, not in any particular order, he refused to give it any order, a list of projects that need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6216.759s">And</a> we heard tonight the lack of maintenance seems to be the Achilles heel with this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6224.544s">No</a> maintenance, no maintenance, no upkeep, and everything deteriorates. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6230.928s">We</a> don't even know what the pool right now, who's gonna manage the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6236.496s">You</a> saw the equipment in the basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6239.197s">You</a> saw those tanks that house the sand and the overflow for water, giant tanks that are six feet in circumference, 10 feet high. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6248.881s">You</a> think someone's going to go down there like you're changing your pool and look at the chemicals and dip a little cotton swab in there and say, oh, everything looks fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6256.544s">You</a> need constant 24-hour, seven-day-a-week maintenance and someone that knows how to handle pool maintenance specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6265.575s">And</a> there's no mention of it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6268.897s">We</a> heard how the pool may generate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6271.639s">Oh,</a> don't worry, the mayor said, this pool's gonna generate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6274.921s">And</a> he referred to other communities that generate money with their pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6280.045s">Just</a> the business we wanna be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6282.927s">Just</a> the business we wanna be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6285.489s">Let's</a> rent our total facilities out to generate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6289.832s">And</a> not put a nickel back into the wear and tear and the upkeep. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6294.428s">And</a> in five years from now, we'll be discussing this pool again. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6297.01s">It's</a> all it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6299.492s">We'll</a> be discussing this pool again. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6304.456s">These</a> are the issues we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6306.197s">And</a> I agree with Carolyn. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6307.238s">I</a> agree with members of this council and we should have the paperwork and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6311.502s">But</a> let me tell you, without seven independent Councilors, none of this is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6317.486s">It's</a> always going to be political. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6320.202s">And</a> Carolyn, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6321.502s">What</a> happens is they pin person against person, organization against organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6326.244s">None</a> of us are opposed to having a swimming pool at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6329.505s">I</a> swam in the pool when I was at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6331.986s">It's</a> a great asset we have as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6334.747s">We're</a> lucky to have a pool of that size and caliber within our confines. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6340.469s">We're</a> very fortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6344.19s">But</a> we can't continue to operate this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6347.191s">We</a> can't continue <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6348.999s">year</a> after year after year to look back and say, well, what are we going to accomplish right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6354.822s">These</a> have to be done long-term, long-term systematic approaches to capital improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6362.645s">You</a> can't do everything in a year or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6365.586s">This</a> is 20 years worth of neglect, 20 years of neglect and lack of upkeep, and we want to accomplish it in one or two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6375.271s">That's</a> what we're looking to do, one or two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6379.804s">It</a> can't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6381.045s">We</a> can't afford, we can't sustain spending of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6385.35s">People</a> are struggling now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6388.312s">And</a> the last thing they want is their taxes to go skyrocketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6396.12s">You</a> know, we're in a rock and a hard place. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6397.582s">We</a> already, seven of us already took a vote on the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6401.546s">We</a> already said we support <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6403.919s">having</a> a pool at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6405.6s">We</a> even think it's a priority, and we're going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6408.622s">And</a> then to come back several months later and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6413.244s">There</a> are some additional costs of $1.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6415.486s">The</a> total project was $2.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6423.85s">You</a> come back with $1.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6426.492s">How</a> outrageous is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6428.673s">I</a> could see $50,000, $75,000 for different costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6432.751s">Another</a> million too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6435.092s">And</a> the phone calls I'm receiving is, geez, how come the council's not supporting the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6439.855s">How</a> come you don't want the kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6441.216s">My</a> son or daughter has to get up at five in the morning to go swim somewhere else, and I have to drive them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6449.48s">And</a> I sympathize with the parents, because they've been doing this for seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6454.403s">However,</a> what I explain to the parents is, the council's on board with the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6459.045s">As</a> I stated to the mayor tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6461.67s">I</a> thought there were going to be people swimming in there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6464.631s">That's</a> why we took the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6469.313s">And</a> now we're being told it's another million, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6472.294s">And</a> then the locker room is a different issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6474.695s">And</a> he found, miraculously found funding for the locker room. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6478.516s">So</a> it's not going to cost us much for the locker room. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6484.178s">I</a> don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6486.619s">You</a> know, at some point, something has to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6493.456s">And</a> the administration was up there in full force tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6496.738s">It's</a> funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6497.158s">We</a> have the bond initiative before us to vote on the actual expenditure and not one department head shows up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6506.122s">Not</a> one person from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6509.404s">We</a> call for a meeting on site at the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6513.005s">We</a> couldn't get in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6513.726s">There</a> was so many people from the administration up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6516.947s">It</a> was mobbed with people from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6521.786s">And</a> they were quick to come to the mayor's defense when things were mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6526.068s">They</a> were quick to say, oh, that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6528.61s">There's</a> nothing in the report, as Diane McLeod said tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6532.892s">There's</a> nothing in the report in 2007 that talked about accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6537.355s">And</a> I said, there most certainly was something in the 2007 report. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6541.017s">You</a> should take a further look at it that mentioned, if you do the construction of the pool, it's going to trigger off accessibility issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6550.609s">So</a> be on notice that you're going to have additional cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6553.871s">And</a> the city was on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6556.132s">The</a> city knew about these additional costs back in 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6561.214s">But</a> we have department heads saying, there was no mention of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6564.295s">We</a> weren't looking for accessibility issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6567.377s">Actually,</a> they mentioned tonight that when the project came out, all they were looking to do was the pool and the surrounding platform around the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6578.271s">And</a> I mentioned to the department head, why didn't we look at something else? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6581.893s">Well,</a> that's what we looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6582.993s">And</a> I said, you looked at it because that was what you asked the architect to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6590.837s">You</a> asked them to look at that specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6593.198s">That's</a> what we're going to pay you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6594.679s">You</a> give us the results on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6596.24s">What</a> do we need for a pool and a platform? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6600.142s">So</a> it was the administration that said, we're not going to look at accessibility issues in the bathroom, in the locker rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6608.373s">They're</a> the ones that commissioned the report, not this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6612.895s">So</a> the only reason why the locker rooms weren't looked at in 2007 was because the administration, at that point, maybe didn't feel it was necessary to talk about accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6626.659s">Or</a> maybe felt by talking about accessibility, you're going to inflate the project, the cost of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6633.962s">And</a> maybe you can't fly a project for 3.5, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6637.802s">million,</a> but you could fly a project for $2.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6642.286s">These</a> are the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6643.748s">And</a> that's why, when I said last week, and I still stand by it, we should have been presented with a close estimate, the closest possible estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6651.836s">No</a> smoke and mirrors. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6655.86s">The</a> closest possible estimate, Mr. President, so we could vote on it as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6661.112s">If</a> we thought it's too expensive, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, let's go back and look at some other proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6666.553s">Maybe</a> we don't have to do X, we'll do Y. We'll do Z and Y, whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6672.074s">But</a> we were never given that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6676.355s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7498.913s">Question.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7499.733s">So</a> is this your first owner's license and method?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7506.192s">But</a> it's your first, you've never had an owner's license before in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7509.834s">Have</a> you driven in the city before? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7512.095s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7519.438s">He</a> has an owner's license now, currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7523.3s">And</a> this is the addition? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7524.761s">Two</a> and three.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7542.677s">So</a> where does that lead us now with the number of ono?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7573.19s">And</a> where are you going to be operating out of?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7580.497s">40</a> Canal Street?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7582.642s">And</a> I assume you're gonna hire, you're gonna look to hire people to drive these cabs?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7595.095s">Roughly</a> how many drivers would you need to have to?
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7604.144s">Two</a> drivers? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7607.718s">Mr.</a> President, I've, in the past several weeks, not voted for operator licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7614.902s">The</a> owner licenses I will support, and as soon as the magic number of 50, or if we plan on reducing it, is met, then I think that issue will be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7626.247s">However,</a> the operator license right now I will not support. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7630.229s">Uh,</a> but this gentleman is not asking for an operator license. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7632.311s">You're</a> asking for an owner's license. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7634.612s">And</a> until we get a new ordinance on the, on the board, uh, and look at the application form that's in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7643.879s">So,</a> uh, we can tackle the issues that, uh, have been confronting this community with, uh, taxi operators operating outside of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7652.646s">Um,</a> so I will support this here tonight, uh, for the taxi owner license.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_flE_htIV76U/2025-03-21_flE_htIV76U.html">Medford City Council - Nov. 29, 2011</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=242.956s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=244.83s">Uh,</a> the purpose of this resolution tonight, uh, is to create a transportation advisory committee, uh, with volunteer citizens who shall act as a clearing house for transportation issues affecting the city of method. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=259.422s">The</a> committee should provide input and advisory direction to boards and commissions and city administration to assist in suggesting creative ways to deal with the myriad of traffic, pedestrian safety issues, transit service, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=272.993s">and</a> transportation planning issues in the city of method responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=277.756s">I</a> perceive this committee to have Mr. President is to review and provide comments and recommendations on a longterm plan to improve pedestrian safety within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=289.324s">Also</a> to review city bus ridership, bus routes every six months and make appropriate recommendations to the council review and provide recommendations on transportation policies, issues and programs, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=301.894s">which</a> involved the MBTA and the commuter rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=305.875s">Review</a> and advise on citywide parking management plan and traffic flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=310.857s">Review</a> and provide recommendations on a citywide bicycle plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=315.399s">Establish</a> an annual work plan to address specific issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=319.188s">You</a> know, the town of Arlington has had a Transportation Advisory Commission, which they refer to as TAC, in place for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=329.801s">And</a> the city of Newton has had this same advisory committee in place, manned with volunteers throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=338.426s">And</a> they are not to replace current traffic commissions, boards, authority of anyone in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=346.516s">It's</a> to act in an advisory capacity to assist in moving issues forward that deal with pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=355.455s">deal</a> with transportation issues in the community, traffic flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=359.757s">These</a> are the issues that we hear week after week, month after month, year after year within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=366.0s">And</a> we as a community can no longer afford to sit back and wait for accidents to happen on our street and then react. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=375.125s">We</a> can no longer afford to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=377.186s">We</a> need to take back our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=380.588s">Our</a> streets have become raceways. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=383.735s">They're</a> no longer a place safe for children, seniors, families to walk down our sidewalks or cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=393.001s">We</a> as a community have to get serious about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=396.523s">And</a> one way I believe we can do this is not to react on every street that comes before us or every issue that comes before us, but to have a board, an advisory committee, whatever you want to call it, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=410.485s">that</a> is there to address issues, to do research, to offer opinions, to hold meetings, to get community input, and to follow through on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=421.488s">One</a> of the biggest concerns I have in this community is the lack of follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=429.43s">And</a> it's not just the administration, it's this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=433.551s">We</a> need to follow through on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=436.385s">You</a> know, we had the residents of Golden Ave that came up before us several months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=441.566s">I'm</a> still getting emails from those residents that were concerned about heavy trucking and speeding on their street. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=449.229s">Nothing</a> has been done to date to improve the conditions on Golden Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=456.15s">This</a> is symptomatic throughout the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=461.732s">We</a> need, Mr. President, to tap upon <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=466.088s">the</a> many involved citizens in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=469.911s">We</a> can no longer say that this is being handled by the traffic commission, or this is being handled by off-street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=477.176s">We</a> need to get people that want to be involved in this community, want to offer their expertise, their life experience, and involve them in committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=490.446s">Residents</a> want to get active. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=491.767s">They</a> want to know how they can help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=493.669s">I've</a> already had several emails <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=496.679s">from</a> residents of this community stating, Mike, if I can get on this committee, please mention my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=503.101s">I'd</a> be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=505.381s">Unsolicited.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=507.022s">People</a> want to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=509.082s">People</a> want to know how they can help out their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=513.303s">There's</a> no salary attached with this citizen advisory board. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=516.884s">It</a> won't cost the city a penny to establish this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=522.163s">And</a> I'm hoping the mayor sees fit in his capacity as the chief executive officer to create a committee, not just to serve for a year and then dissolve or two years and dissolve, but to be established lifelong committee in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=538.033s">Transportation,</a> although the forms may change and the type of transportation, there'll always be a need to oversee transportation within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=548.12s">There</a> will always be a need. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=550.26s">to</a> make sure pedestrian safety is at the forefront of every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=557.927s">There</a> will always be a need to make sure that our streets are safe, that the T's are accessible, that the current routes work, that the Green Line extension, whatever the capacity may be, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=573.902s">It's</a> going to be beneficial for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=576.224s">These</a> are the things I envision this volunteer committee to work on and make recommendations and they will have a yearly agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=584.609s">This</a> won't be behind closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=586.951s">This</a> won't be operated in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=589.692s">These</a> will be meetings held by committee posted by the city clerk and attended by residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=600.72s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=602.728s">I</a> talked to one of the town administrators over in Arlington and they said, honestly, they don't know where they would be without this advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=615.057s">That's</a> how involved, how influential and how active this committee is in pushing issues forward and doing the research and offering the framework that needs to be done in order to get the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=634.365s">You</a> know, these are the issues that need to be looked at, and we can't afford to address them one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=641.11s">What</a> street comes up that doesn't have resident permit parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=644.132s">The</a> unfortunate accident on Winthrop Street where a student was hit, and now we have painted crosswalks and signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=652.558s">No,</a> we can't afford to operate a city no longer like this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=656.711s">I</a> know there's a resident that came up, there was several residents that emailed me that said they couldn't make it tonight, but we're in full support. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=662.555s">I</a> believe they sent the entire council the email also. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=665.798s">They're</a> in full support of this and I'm hoping, Mr. President, that the mayor sees fit, that it's time that we move this community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=674.784s">We</a> start addressing the transportation issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=676.845s">You</a> know, we're five minutes from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=679.067s">We</a> have all sorts of commuter rail access, T access into town and it's about time <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=686.557s">that</a> we take this issue by the horns. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=690.158s">And</a> it's about time we take our streets back. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=693.679s">And</a> I don't want to hear from families that they're afraid to send their kids out because of the speeding on their street, or they're afraid to send them to the square because of the traffic and the cars and the lack of enforcement. <a

 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1410.428s">And</a> I respect the gentleman at the podium, as he said, stated, I've known him for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1414.529s">Um,</a> I think he's missing the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1418.331s">And</a> if I could just state, no, you're hiding the resolution, Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1422.092s">I</a> met Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1424.553s">He's</a> got a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1425.814s">The</a> resolution is printed on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1427.654s">So</a> nothing is hidden here. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1429.595s">The</a> intent of the resolution, Dr. Wood is to establish an advisory committee in nature <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1435.097s">to</a> assist the city, and I know you're trying to make this a Green Line issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1439.14s">No,</a> I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1440.32s">That's</a> all you've stated is Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1441.781s">Well,</a> you want me to go further? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1442.962s">This</a> is not a Green Line issue, Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1445.103s">This</a> is an issue relative to having citizens of this community take an active role <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1450.887s">and</a> taking back our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1452.788s">If</a> you heard the issues that I hear on a daily basis regarding people that are afraid to cross our streets, regarding transportation issues, regarding speeding on our streets, regarding the lack of signage, the lack of crosswalks, and the list goes on and on, Dr. Wood, then you would realize <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1470.39s">that</a> there is a need to supplement what's currently taking place, as Councilor Del Russo alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1476.431s">What's</a> currently taking place right now is this community reacts to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1481.552s">Rather</a> than having a committee, in my opinion, there would be advisory in nature, and it would be appointed, and that's why this wasn't crafted to create a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1491.835s">There's</a> no language here that says how many members, who will appoint, or so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1496.276s">We're</a> asking the mayor in his capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1498.678s">as</a> the chief executive officer to look into this and establish a transportation advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1504.542s">We're</a> not asking him to turn this into a political ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1507.944s">We're</a> not asking him to sway this to put people that are in favor of the green line on this committee and, and, and, and make everyone else not part of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1517.169s">So</a> I don't think there's any, um, you know, as you state that, uh, you know, there's no malice behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1525.074s">There's</a> no intent to exclude people. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1527.495s">Anyone</a> would be welcome to serve in a citizen advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1530.918s">I</a> appreciate your input, but I just don't want people to believe this is Green Line or against Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1536.243s">This</a> has nothing to do other than with improving transportation within our community.
 <p>[Michael Marks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5492.857s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5494.357s">From</a> what I understand, Councilor Penter is looking to establish <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5497.668s">a</a> joint meeting with the school committee, which would include the superintendent of schools, and I would assume the head of curriculum and headmasters and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5507.774s">And</a> then we can probably get some answers on what the curriculum is, what's being taught, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5513.518s">So</a> I would support having a joint meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5515.84s">We</a> actually have one of the newly elected school committee members in the audience, Aaron DiBenedetto, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5521.603s">who</a> I don't expect to get up to the podium, but is showing an interest by coming to our meeting tonight on this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5528.988s">And</a> I believe that it would be worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5533.891s">None</a> of us are gonna sit down and read 40 chapters. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5535.893s">I</a> can speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5537.254s">I'm</a> not gonna sit down and read 40 chapters. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5539.595s">So</a> if I say let's postpone this until I'm done reading the 40 chapters and viewing the 60 minute video, it's never gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5547.673s">But</a> I'd be more than happy, and I'm interested enough in this particular issue, to sit down with the school committee, listen what administrators have to say, listen what Mr. Belson has to say, the head of curriculum at the public schools, and then make an informed decision on which way. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5563.421s">But</a> I think to say we don't have enough information, you're correct in one aspect, but the other aspect, when are we gonna have enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5571.606s">When</a> are we all gonna get together and say, you know what, we have enough information, let's move forward on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5576.211s">I</a> only think a joint meeting would help us have a better understanding on what's being taught in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5584.081s">Maybe</a> listening to parents that have concerns, as Councilor Penta mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5588.153s">about</a> what's being taught and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5590.134s">And</a> that's, speak on fact, not what we believe or what might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5595.776s">But,</a> you know, so I'm in favor of a joint meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5599.217s">We</a> asked several months for a joint meeting regarding the high school pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5602.838s">Has</a> that ever happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5604.198s">So,</a> you know, there's a lot of things that we asked, you know, to get together with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5609.74s">And</a> this, I think, is a worthy issue to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5613.141s">And</a> so I would support having a joint meeting with the administration and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5618.43s">Thank</a> you.
