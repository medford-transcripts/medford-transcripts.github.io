 <p>[Robert Maiocco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1413.337s">We</a> are again privileged this morning to gather here at the Salem Street Burying Ground to renew a tradition and to fulfill an imperative obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1422.722s">That</a> of paying homage to the early settlers of our community who on that fateful April day in 1775 sent forth 59 brave men <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1432.6s">to</a> join in the battle of Lexington and Concord. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1436.521s">The</a> men of Penton Company and the volunteers that they picked up along the way joined with Reading Company and fought the British at Marion's Corner in Lexington. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1446.824s">Two</a> of the 59 gave the allowance to the cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1450.425s">In</a> today's society, there are those who claim that patriotism is out of fashion, that to remember the deeds and the sacrifices of those who founded, who built, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1461.3s">and</a> whoever offended this free nation of ours is to say the least, passe. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1465.202s">But</a> we in Medford continue to meet for that purpose as we do this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1472.166s">Thank</a> you to our historical, veterans, and scout organizations, and to the efforts of caring individuals to take this day duly observed with appropriate ceremonies in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1483.133s">To</a> them, I offer our thanks for their dedication to take this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1487.755s">As</a> citizens of the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1489.698s">that</a> is blessed with such a rich heritage, a history that is unsurpassed by any locality, we remember with deep pride and venerate with lasting appreciation the men who answered with gallantry the call to violence at the beginning of the wall for American independence. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1505.985s">Those</a> patriots were the giants of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1510.747s">How</a> can we not be proud as we look with lasting respect to that great pyramid that stands at the center of this burial ground? <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1519.099s">a</a> monument that honors General John Wilkes. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1521.921s">As</a> a young man, he was among those who took up arms on April 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1526.844s">His</a> service in Lexington was but an early page in a long and distinguished career as a soldier, a physician, a public servant, and as a respected citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1537.67s">We</a> would be remiss as a community if we failed to remember people like John Wilkes, forbearers who stand out so boldly in Medford history. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1546.075s">A</a> friendly comrade of George Washington, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1549.05s">John</a> Brooks went on to achieve the rank of Major General, and as a public servant, he served the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as its governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1557.113s">To</a> this day, he remains the only Bedford resident to have ever served in the state's highest office, its governorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1564.295s">That</a> grand monument was erected in 1838, eight years following his death, by some very proud citizens of the then small town of Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1573.958s">The</a> inscription on that monument is vivid in telling us <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1577.896s">why</a> that great patriot was so widely known, so highly honored, and so truly beloved. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1583.357s">It</a> reads, sacred to the memory of John Brooks, who was born in that visit in May of 1752, and educated at the town school. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1592.499s">He</a> took up arms for his country on the ancient day of April, 1775. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1597.941s">He</a> commanded a regiment which first entered the enemy's lines in Saratoga, and served with honor to the end of the war. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1604.997s">He</a> was appointed Marshal of the District of Massachusetts by President Washington, and after filling several important civic and military offices, he was, in the year 1816, chosen Governor of Commonwealth and discharged the duties of Asst. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1618.899s">Station</a> to seven successive years to General Acceptance. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1623.98s">He</a> was a kind and skillful physician, a brave and prudent officer, a wise, firm, and impartial magistrate, a true patriot, a good citizen, and a faithful friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1634.866s">In</a> his vanity as a gentleman, a moral cure, and in the profession and practice of a consistent Christian, he departed this life in peace on the 1st of March, 1825, aged 73. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1646.252s">This</a> monument to his honor and memory was erected by several of his fellow citizens and friends in the year 1838. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1653.656s">Those</a> who penned that inscription and erected that monument, I am confident, fully expected, that those who follow them in the future decades <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1663.19s">would</a> continue to perpetuate the memories of men and women like General Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1667.573s">People</a> who played such a prominent role in the history of veteran, and of Massachusetts, and yes, of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1675.339s">Today,</a> 157 years after the dedication of the Brooks Monument on this April morning in 1995, we do just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1684.366s">We</a> continue to remember with pride and an appreciation of our heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1689.69s">It</a> slew not only the 59 men of veteran company, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1693.034s">who</a> my collection can not only have recurred citizen soldier John Brooks, but all men and women who have followed them for more than two centuries, bravely and resolutely answering the call to arms whenever the freedom of our nation has been at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1709.223s">In</a> remembering their deeds and their sacrifices, each of us can better appreciate what we enjoy in times of peace, the many bounties that arise as a free people. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1719.389s">On</a> this great crusade, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1720.868s">Coming</a> this year is the season of Easter and Passover. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=1724.89s">Let</a> us ask God to bless our community of Bethlehem and to bless the United States of America.
