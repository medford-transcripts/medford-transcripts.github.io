    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=820.642s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Could you go to the next steps slide again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=828.913s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the Charter Study Commission wants to release their final report soon, which is sooner than they anticipated it being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=837.719s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It had initially said December, but it's only October, which is nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=842.843s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And the mayor is hoping to review it first and then give her response?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=855.103s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I guess being that it's that they're going to come out with their response so soon, maybe I would suggest that we would see what they're thinking as compare it with what we have for a generic idea of things and kind of go from there would be my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=879.198s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They've been spending a lot of time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=881.44s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And a lot of having a lot of meetings and doing a lot of public participation, it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=888.363s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm eager to see where they've gone with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=892.605s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I know that there's a lot to take into consideration with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=901.669s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But yeah, thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=903.989s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really helpful to have it all laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1489.224s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just, is there a way that, I was just looking, trying to look through the documents just now that the committee posted and I couldn't find the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1500.989s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, it's not released.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1504.51s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But you have the motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1508.166s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I was looking at the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1510.769s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And so the committee has really put a lot of like, they voted on every, every recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1517.054s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So every single decision was a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1519.536s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it does cover a lot of ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2195.993s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing that I wanna mention about to answer the Zoom question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2202.814s">[Lazzaro]</a>: of residents question, Michelle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2206.659s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing that we would lose if this question, question seven in particular, does not pass, it's a very specific, I believe it's question seven, it's a very specific thing about the high school schedule, which right now does not allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2220.875s">[Lazzaro]</a>: some of the students who are taking specific classes, I believe it's in the vocational school, to take certain art classes, theater classes, visual arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2232.303s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It limits our students in being the fully well-rounded students that we want them to be able to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2239.068s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When you're in high school, you want to be able to explore<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2242.63s">[Lazzaro]</a>: figure out who you are, what you're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2244.812s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we want to give all of our students the best opportunity to be everything that they can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2249.756s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we don't want to limit them because we haven't had the opportunity to expand the schedule to really experiment with what that can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2257.722s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will also say that in 2019, I worked for the school district and I knew then that we were underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2265.027s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I started thinking about running for city council to make something like this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2268.51s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This has been happening for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2270.071s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have had underfunded<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2271.992s">[Lazzaro]</a>: schools for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2273.073s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And this has been in the works for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2274.694s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This has needed to happen for quite a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2277.435s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5917.923s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are, I would paraphrase Councillor Lemming and say that we aren't all even asking for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5926.588s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are giving the voters of Medford the opportunity to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5931.724s">[Lazzaro]</a>: raise their own taxes if they would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.027s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.988s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You're allowed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5935.589s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5936.63s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're here to answer questions about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5941.457s">[Lazzaro]</a>: not to convince anybody to do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5943.358s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're just telling you what we know and what we have the luxury of knowing from having this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5950.624s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I will say is that historic underfunding has led to, and having never passed an override before, has led to such scenarios as me receiving an email that there is lead in the water at the Brooks Elementary School where my kids go because of fixtures<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5970.129s">[Lazzaro]</a>: in the building in a school that was built after the year 2000 because corners were cut because money was tried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5978.315s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They were trying to save money when they built the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5980.677s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's what happens when you don't fund your city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5984.7s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we can keep trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5987.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We can keep trying to not fund our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5990.168s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's a choice that the voters have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5992.949s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And everybody, that's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5995.251s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we all have the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5997.292s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Everybody has the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5998.872s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we're here to answer your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6000.433s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not trying to say you're good or you're bad or you're doing whatever, but I really hope, I hope that we are making decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6011.439s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They might be hard decisions, but we're making decisions that are taking care of each other, that are prioritizing the people that we care about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6021.184s">[Lazzaro]</a>: understanding the fiscal responsibility that we have towards each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7300.319s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would offer that another counselor might be better equipped to answer the question about the way that debt exclusions are structured legally, the ramifications of how you estimate the dollar amount that it's going to cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7313.766s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I will say that the firehouse is a property of the city, which means it's owned by the residents of Medford, not the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7324.231s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So even if the union is not in agreement with the mayor, the property is owned by the city and if it's not in good working order and we need to maintain the building, it's important that the building be maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8039.024s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I used to work for the superintendent of schools, Dr. Edward Vincent, and I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8046.739s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've never worked for somebody who has had so much integrity and led from such a place of integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8052.302s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I believe that she, when she answered Councilor Scarpelli, who I think asked her that question a number of times over and over again, in order to try to get her to say something off or make a mistake, but she was trying to not lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8073.793s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And what she doesn't wanna do is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8076.567s">[Lazzaro]</a>: be caught up in having to make a decision that doesn't put the best scenario for the students first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8086.639s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So my guess is that that was where that was coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8092.045s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Also, that things shift in schools all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8094.608s">[Lazzaro]</a>: People leave districts for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8096.834s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If you can't reinforce or if you can't reappoint somebody to something because they got another job, these things happen all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8103.338s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can't always put somebody back in a position because they've gotten another position somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8108.521s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not always possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8110.462s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that was, I think she was trying to be truthful to the best of her ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8114.844s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The other thing I will say is I'm sorry to have hurt anybody's feelings, but I really did not appreciate getting an email saying that the fixtures inside the school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8124.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: cause there to be lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8125.926s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I am not saying it as it was somebody else's fault, but my kids go to school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8131.129s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8134.831s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10574.17s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to hear about that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10577.873s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I actually know a lot of people who have kids with learning disabilities in the schools that struggle similarly, and I know it's a big hill to overcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10591.192s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and it's a lot to grapple with and it's really frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10594.735s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I know we have a lot of work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10596.976s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I also think this is a school committee question and it's not something that we on city council grapple with very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10603.661s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I don't think that we're equipped to answer it fully, but I feel for you and it's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10614.048s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I would recommend bringing it up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10617.799s">[Lazzaro]</a>: to school committee asking if you could get something like that on the agenda or speaking to the school superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10622.981s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know it can be super, super frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10625.082s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I have friends with advocates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10626.783s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10627.603s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10628.944s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really unequitable because if you have money, you can hire somebody to either be a tutor or get an advocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10636.286s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10637.847s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a bad system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10639.448s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Literacy is so complicated and difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10641.689s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm really sorry you're going through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11255.542s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I, I, I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11257.804s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are you saying that we shouldn't be accepting English language learners into our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11265.939s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They're expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11266.76s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not going to do back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11269.402s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's not what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11270.503s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're asking questions about the overage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11271.924s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not talking about how English language learners are expensive for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11276.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is a public school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11278.428s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That is not something that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11279.729s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12582.958s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was me, but I was just gonna mention Councilor Lemming's linkage fees, which he mentioned, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13094.83s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13323.546s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm currently serving on the committee that is working on the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13329.331s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And when the MSBA is going to ask us to request a debt exclusion for the new high school, that's gonna be significantly more expensive than what the firehouse will cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13349.486s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that we will be able to come back and ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13353.063s">[Lazzaro]</a>: for another debt exclusion for a firehouse at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13357.825s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it will take longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13359.525s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that there's a possibility that there could be an approved fire station between the two parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13368.469s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Once this debt exclusion, if it is approved, then I think the money will be available and a satisfactory firehouse can be built, or there's the opportunity for it to be built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13381.383s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think time is of the essence because of the limited nature of the timeline, given that we have an urgency of the high school coming down the pike as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13392.292s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have a lot of people in town vying for very large projects heading our direction, and I think we have to balance a lot of people's needs all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13407.964s">[Lazzaro]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=472.399s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't know Larry for very long, but I really appreciated that he, what I did know of him was that he was really fun and he was really kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=485.283s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And he was really nice to my kids when he dropped off packets at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=491.024s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And if I can be remembered that way, I would consider myself very lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=497.734s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He had my back literally and figuratively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=500.035s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was really nice having him behind me when he was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=502.997s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I had a kind of a tough time at a few meetings in the beginning of my tenure here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=508.601s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And he was very steady in presence, really, really, really nice about stuff and really kind to me and funny and cheerful and steady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=520.688s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=523.426s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I hope he and I hope he rests in peace and I hope his family finds comfort and how well loved he was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=155.796s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is Medford City Council, Public Health and Community Safety Committee, October 16th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=165.001s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are meeting today to discuss a couple of items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=171.465s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=174.427s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=190.317s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=191.118s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Four present, one absent, meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=194.899s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We will be discussing two items today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=197.721s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The first is 22-379 offered by Councilor Seng and Councilor Collins, Resolution of Draft and Ordinance to Secure Rights to Gender Affirming Care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=211.631s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that will be actually in conjunction with 22-453, which is a former item offered by President Behrs, Vice President Collins, and former Councilor Morrell, resolution to discuss potential ordinances and policies to protect reproductive rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=229.745s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So these are two items that I will ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=237.509s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Sang to summarize for us and then we can get started discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=242.433s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have also a draft that Councilor Sang shared with the committee today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=250.06s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=600.037s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=601.198s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I believe we still need a response from a police chief Buckley and the board of health director, Brian O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=613.688s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would be happy to reach out to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=616.277s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure if we need a motion for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=618.739s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=620.88s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I can't make that motion anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=625.143s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=625.903s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=627.504s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I was just skimming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=630.126s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure where in the language, if there is anything in the language that sort of mentions the anti-abortion clinics, or if we have the capacity to put something like that in an ordinance that would prevent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=646.254s">[Lazzaro]</a>: a facility like that from opening, or if we would be able to do something like that, but I would be curious to hear your thoughts on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=691.414s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It may be something that we want to, when we go line by line on an individual basis and then come back and talk about it, it might be worth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=699.813s">[Lazzaro]</a>: looking at, it might just be something I haven't had a chance yet to go through with a fine tooth comb, which is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=708.775s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also think it might be something that we may have to ask legal about our capacity for what we would be able to, what we can say to a business that wants to come in and what we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=725.977s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But anyway, I think this is a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=729.983s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree that sending feedback with another meeting and maybe scheduling another meeting that would be probably next month and see if we can get some more solid plans in place at that point would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=744.395s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=747.737s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other comments from, or do you have more that you want to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=764.748s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=765.088s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any further comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=769.711s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=772.413s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion Councilor Sang mentioned was that councilors send feedback to myself and CC Councilor Sang before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=785.641s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=788.87s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=791.511s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor, oh, we lost Councilor, oh, there they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=797.373s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'll just hold on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=806.436s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, there was traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=807.457s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=808.117s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=832.4s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I will withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=834.861s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And so just to update the councilors that just arrived, we have been talking about the drafted language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=843.605s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do you have the language from Councilor Sang or have you, you may not have had a chance to look it over because it was really fresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=857.61s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's some, we have some up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=891.516s">[Lazzaro]</a>: to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=893.558s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councillor Sang has been going over a summary of where we're at with the ordinances about gender affirming care and reproductive health care in Medford, including non-cooperation of police if there's any outside of Massachusetts entity trying to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=917.29s">[Lazzaro]</a>: enforce laws that are not applicable in Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=921.612s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any anti-abortion clinics that may be trying to open in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=926.794s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What would be our capacity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=928.275s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We discussed what would be our capacity as a city council to attempt to prevent or enact a rule against a predatory<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=943.851s">[Lazzaro]</a>: business like that opening, and these are, we're just at a discussion stage at this point, but Councilor Seng did distribute some language that would be the motion on the floor at the moment is from Councilor Seng, seconded by Councilor Lemming for the members of the committee to review the language as written now, including a couple of sentences that Councilor Seng will add in about the anti-abortion clinics<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=972.7s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that are not currently in here, but he will add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=975.563s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And if you can review the language and send thoughts or edits to myself and see what the councilors are saying before our next meeting, then we can keep moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=987.834s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But it's not, we're not at the stage yet of obviously a line by line review of the ordinance as a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=995.973s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, you may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1010.622s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1011.082s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That would be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1013.904s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1014.564s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Please do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1019.547s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1025.02s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will also reach out to the Director of the Board of Health and the Chief of Police for their feedback on the language thus far, because we haven't heard from them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1038.206s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And this is two papers that were in the past two sessions or past session that we're reviewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1051.352s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So now you're all up to speed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1053.855s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any comments from, yes, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1138.304s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1139.004s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1140.178s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1143.601s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1145.843s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1147.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1150.767s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The next item for tonight is item 24- Oh, just quickly on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1233.911s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The question was, would the committee be interested in taking up a paper on ensuring access to enshrining in an ordinance something of pharmacy compliance with maintaining access to emergency contraception?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1251.662s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1252.483s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, emergency contraception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1255.396s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Would that include like Misoprostol, Mifepristone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1259.68s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1260.821s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1261.302s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1261.702s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1262.103s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that would be like abortion pills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1263.904s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1265.306s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1265.526s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1308.41s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I see a thumbs up, which is not a spur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1312.914s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I see a thumbs up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1316.837s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It sounds like there's some interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1318.859s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I mean, I am interested in it from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1321.18s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, there's like a less of a, I don't know, I can't make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1324.283s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a little bit more casual from the chair of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1328.947s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But yes, I mean, I would be interested in doing something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1332.27s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm curious about, I am still curious about like what our capacity is as a city to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1341.293s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What our capacity is as a city to do anything that wouldn't be already in trend in state law, but I do also think that there is value in affirming something that is right and correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1354.536s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So yeah, I would be in favor of discussing it for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1357.797s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think to that end, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1360.598s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1380.802s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think so, especially because at a local level, like we have many pharmacies in town, that would be a very localized thing to do, so that makes sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1404.916s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Would it be something that you would need to present a paper to the regular committee to then have it reviewed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1413.999s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The 22-453 resolution to discuss potential ordinances and policies to protect reproductive rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1419.861s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1420.802s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It absolutely falls under that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1426.644s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So on the motion of Councilor Sang to draft language for an ordinance to ensure pharmacy compliance with the state executive order on emergency contraception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1451.456s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1453.157s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1454.577s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1455.498s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1456.417s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1457.398s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1461.46s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are we ready to jump to the next paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1466.543s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1467.123s">[Lazzaro]</a>: 24-470, offered by Justin Seng, City Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1470.725s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Resolution to discuss the installation of sanitary facilities in public spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1477.428s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Public Health and Community Safety Subcommittee meet to consider potential ordinances, policies, and regulations to strengthen the protection<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1486.624s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, no, that's the wrong one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1488.848s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1490.591s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1493.356s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Discuss the possibility of installing sanitary facilities and public spaces, including in our parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1498.745s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councillor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1542.813s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that one of the first things we'll have to consider is the cost and where, how to begin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1555.036s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Where do we begin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1559.285s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Councillor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1564.848s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councillor Lemming, and then Councillor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1650.71s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would suggest the Medford Family Network would be a good<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1653.57s">[Lazzaro]</a>: starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1654.691s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know they even have playgroups in the park, and they go to different parks, and probably they, Miss Andrea, I think, leads those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1666.34s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I can't remember her last name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1668.241s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I'm sure they'll have some feedback about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1672.845s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But for sure, probably Medford Family Network, Frances Nwaje, good starting points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1683.581s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Disabilities Commission, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1686.482s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councillor Collins, are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1687.563s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is your hand up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1818.97s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, I would be curious to hear from, uh, Director Hunt from the planning and permitting, or planning, uh, no, that's the committee, planning department, planning sustainability department, and, um, Director McGivern from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1836.629s">[Lazzaro]</a>: DPW or DPW as well, because just of their awareness, their institutional knowledge of the city and this is deceptively a large undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1852.117s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's the sort of thing that seems like it would be simple and is actually a huge, a huge project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1856.859s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But again, I think Vice President Collins had it hit the nail on the head that it's just because something's hard or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1865.987s">[Lazzaro]</a>: feels overwhelming in the moment doesn't mean you shouldn't start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1869.47s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it still needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1873.233s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it's just a fundamental human thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1878.937s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we need to try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1881.76s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So basically we have to talk to every department head in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1886.824s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have to spend a lot of money probably, but I think it will be, I think there are ways to do it that are more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1895.023s">[Lazzaro]</a>: efficient and reasonable and if we take our time and do it right then it'll make more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1900.45s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1940.433s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is this like a cost-benefit analysis kind of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2016.832s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2079.23s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, so, as, as, so, so, Councilor lemmings motion, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2087.702s">[Lazzaro]</a>: city staff rather than specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2099.13s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2119.321s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2173.127s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is that acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2173.968s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2174.308s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2216.388s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2218.772s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2295.2s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2391.837s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2393.518s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2407.206s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2407.847s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Mr Wilworth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2437.708s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for coming and speaking on behalf of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2440.79s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We appreciate you taking the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2445.893s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do, another thing to note is that I've observed that some parks have port-a-potties at them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2453.679s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure who pays for them, why they're there at some times of the year and other times they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2458.902s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It must be some privately funded, maybe it's an organization like Medford Youth Soccer, maybe it's the softball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2464.526s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, it's probably different times of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2467.227s">[Lazzaro]</a>: privately funded, but it's inequitable because it's at different places, and then you have access to it sometimes, and then sometimes you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2476.709s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So just something to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2481.81s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Many parts of the city are privatized right now, and if there's an opportunity for us to explore ways that we can give access to folks in the city publicly, then maybe we should explore that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2547.204s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Right, pennies on the dollar compared to what it would cost one organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2553.226s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2559.707s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2560.888s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2561.868s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other motions for this paper before... Any other motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2570.494s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Councilor, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2580.22s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion, Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2583.423s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2585.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2585.964s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2587.645s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=734.752s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to keep the paper in committee and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=740.336s">[Lazzaro]</a>: keep paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=893.443s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Am I, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=894.424s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yep, you're recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=895.004s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know why I'm called on with the new system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=896.465s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=898.467s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=898.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to, via email through the clerk, I had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=905.498s">[Lazzaro]</a>: mentioned something about the links being embedded for neatness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=911.865s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I was told that all the links would be embedded, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=916.73s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I have already reviewed the sections on the committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=921.295s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They look good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=922.596s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for your work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1050.672s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I like the suggested edit a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1053.113s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1139.089s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We passed Sarah Bradley Fulton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1140.93s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We tabled the commemoration of the DPW workers that will be discussed, I believe, at the next October meeting on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1152.197s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just because it was so late and we didn't want to give it short shrift, but Sarah Bradley Fulton was coming up that next weekend, so we needed to make sure it was happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1512.908s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3259.366s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing I can say about grants that you can apply for through the EPA and other grant making<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3267.51s">[Lazzaro]</a>: companies, opportunities, foundations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3270.052s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can't fund a city, you can't operate a budget for a city of our size on grants alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3279.077s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It just wouldn't be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3280.417s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there are opportunities for things like that, and it is exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3284.359s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I can definitely say that Alicia Klein and other department heads are utilizing every opportunity that they come across and they are aware of these opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3296.042s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've spoken with Tim McKibben as well about a number of opportunities that they are aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3301.844s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it is something that's being utilized when it's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4071.649s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just one thing I want to add, there's a lot of things at the city level where we have to vote as a city council to authorize funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4082.213s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mean that the money is immediately spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4084.754s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It means that we are authorizing funds to let somebody move forward with a mechanism to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4095.179s">[Lazzaro]</a>: start a project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4096.1s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mean that you're writing a check that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4098.284s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This sort of reminds me of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4100.667s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You're authorizing us to take out a bond as the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4105.615s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So as things move and change, that process continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1310.956s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, this committee meeting was to discuss a number of items that have come up over the past sessions about gender-affirming care, reproductive health, and the possibility of gender-affirming care<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1331.072s">[Lazzaro]</a>: public bathrooms in our parks in Medford and just the feasibility of all of these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1336.514s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This was a preliminary meeting for us to discuss the possibility of addressing all of these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1343.877s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we talked sort of broadly about how to begin the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1349.98s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.122s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.863s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also just wanted to reiterate that we appreciate the concerns, especially, I understand that every time I visited the Senior Center, it's an incredibly bustling place to visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2252.331s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All the activities are really well attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2256.233s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know that mobility issues can be a big concern for folks who are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2260.519s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I know that parking is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2262.582s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And my hope would be that as the city reviews the proposals that parking is always and public parking parking that's available to be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2271.333s">[Lazzaro]</a>: would still be part of the buildings that they put there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2274.757s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But Councilor Lemming and I, we're members of the Resident Services Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2280.442s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And as part of that, we did a listening session at the Senior Center a few months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2285.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It wasn't super well attended, but it was the only only the first one we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2288.79s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we didn't have a chance to make it sort of a consistent thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2293.074s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I would be excited to do that more often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2295.737s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and have more opportunities for people to bring us what they're concerned about and tell us about the things like that, that are coming up more regularly that you're thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2304.659s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And maybe if we can make it something that perhaps rotating members of city council that can come to the senior center and hear concerns from people, we can look into that in resident services and talk more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6314.721s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6315.462s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, when we talk about increasing property taxes and our prep two and a half override questions we also discuss new growth frequently because that's another mechanism for increasing revenue to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6331.182s">[Lazzaro]</a>: this will be a wonderful opportunity to increase revenue coming into Medford without asking our residents to pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6342.628s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That will contribute to the services that we can provide our residents, and this is the way we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6348.531s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm so grateful to Vice President Collins and the rest of the Planning and Permitting Committee for all of their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6355.194s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6356.121s">[Lazzaro]</a>: watching the meetings lately, and it's just taken a ton of commitment and a lot of very careful, thoughtful planning and design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6366.983s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and a lot of great collaboration with Innis Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6370.627s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm looking forward to seeing where we go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6374.571s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But this is new growth on Mystic Ebb has the potential to pay for things like keeping the library open on Sundays, like smaller projects that we couldn't possibly justify with larger things like an override because they're, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6389.861s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that we can't afford to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6391.743s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um uh, things that are too too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6392.764s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There are too many things we need to pay for that we can't afford yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6395.527s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And the way that we bring in that revenue without asking our residents to scrimp and save and give us more is by giving our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6409.621s">[Lazzaro]</a>: we want to be able to provide the services that our residents need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6413.745s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also did just want to address briefly that I know that our City Hall employees are attempting in many ways to address a lot of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6425.558s">[Lazzaro]</a>: public feedback that they do need for things like car park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6430.441s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I work out in car park a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6432.422s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't live near car park, but a lot of my friends do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6435.404s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I was approached by a city hall employee in car park when I was exercising once to ask me to weigh in on phase two of car park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6445.011s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What do I need to see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6445.911s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I did an online form that I was given, like, what do you want in car park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6450.634s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there were, there was, I experienced some outreach about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6455.512s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's hard to reach everybody, but I think that there are a lot of avenues that City Hall employees in the planning department are attempting to achieve and we appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6467.636s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I know it can be tough, but it's, they're doing it, they're trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6471.917s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>
