    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2195.993s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing that I wanna mention about to answer the Zoom question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2202.814s">[Lazzaro]</a>: of residents question, Michelle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2206.659s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing that we would lose if this question, question seven in particular, does not pass, it's a very specific, I believe it's question seven, it's a very specific thing about the high school schedule, which right now does not allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2220.875s">[Lazzaro]</a>: some of the students who are taking specific classes, I believe it's in the vocational school, to take certain art classes, theater classes, visual arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2232.303s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It limits our students in being the fully well-rounded students that we want them to be able to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2239.068s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When you're in high school, you want to be able to explore<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2242.63s">[Lazzaro]</a>: figure out who you are, what you're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2244.812s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we want to give all of our students the best opportunity to be everything that they can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2249.756s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we don't want to limit them because we haven't had the opportunity to expand the schedule to really experiment with what that can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2257.722s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will also say that in 2019, I worked for the school district and I knew then that we were underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2265.027s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I started thinking about running for city council to make something like this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2268.51s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This has been happening for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2270.071s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have had underfunded<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2271.992s">[Lazzaro]</a>: schools for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2273.073s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And this has been in the works for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2274.694s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This has needed to happen for quite a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2277.435s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5917.923s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are, I would paraphrase Councillor Lemming and say that we aren't all even asking for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5926.588s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are giving the voters of Medford the opportunity to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5931.724s">[Lazzaro]</a>: raise their own taxes if they would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.027s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.988s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You're allowed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5935.589s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5936.63s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're here to answer questions about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5941.457s">[Lazzaro]</a>: not to convince anybody to do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5943.358s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're just telling you what we know and what we have the luxury of knowing from having this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5950.624s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I will say is that historic underfunding has led to, and having never passed an override before, has led to such scenarios as me receiving an email that there is lead in the water at the Brooks Elementary School where my kids go because of fixtures<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5970.129s">[Lazzaro]</a>: in the building in a school that was built after the year 2000 because corners were cut because money was tried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5978.315s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They were trying to save money when they built the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5980.677s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's what happens when you don't fund your city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5984.7s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we can keep trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5987.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We can keep trying to not fund our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5990.168s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's a choice that the voters have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5992.949s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And everybody, that's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5995.251s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we all have the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5997.292s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Everybody has the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5998.872s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we're here to answer your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6000.433s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not trying to say you're good or you're bad or you're doing whatever, but I really hope, I hope that we are making decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6011.439s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They might be hard decisions, but we're making decisions that are taking care of each other, that are prioritizing the people that we care about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6021.184s">[Lazzaro]</a>: understanding the fiscal responsibility that we have towards each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7300.319s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would offer that another counselor might be better equipped to answer the question about the way that debt exclusions are structured legally, the ramifications of how you estimate the dollar amount that it's going to cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7313.766s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I will say that the firehouse is a property of the city, which means it's owned by the residents of Medford, not the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7324.231s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So even if the union is not in agreement with the mayor, the property is owned by the city and if it's not in good working order and we need to maintain the building, it's important that the building be maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8039.024s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I used to work for the superintendent of schools, Dr. Edward Vincent, and I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8046.739s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've never worked for somebody who has had so much integrity and led from such a place of integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8052.302s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I believe that she, when she answered Councilor Scarpelli, who I think asked her that question a number of times over and over again, in order to try to get her to say something off or make a mistake, but she was trying to not lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8073.793s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And what she doesn't wanna do is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8076.567s">[Lazzaro]</a>: be caught up in having to make a decision that doesn't put the best scenario for the students first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8086.639s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So my guess is that that was where that was coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8092.045s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Also, that things shift in schools all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8094.608s">[Lazzaro]</a>: People leave districts for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8096.834s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If you can't reinforce or if you can't reappoint somebody to something because they got another job, these things happen all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8103.338s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can't always put somebody back in a position because they've gotten another position somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8108.521s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not always possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8110.462s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that was, I think she was trying to be truthful to the best of her ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8114.844s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The other thing I will say is I'm sorry to have hurt anybody's feelings, but I really did not appreciate getting an email saying that the fixtures inside the school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8124.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: cause there to be lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8125.926s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I am not saying it as it was somebody else's fault, but my kids go to school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8131.129s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8134.831s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10574.17s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to hear about that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10577.873s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I actually know a lot of people who have kids with learning disabilities in the schools that struggle similarly, and I know it's a big hill to overcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10591.192s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and it's a lot to grapple with and it's really frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10594.735s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I know we have a lot of work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10596.976s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I also think this is a school committee question and it's not something that we on city council grapple with very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10603.661s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I don't think that we're equipped to answer it fully, but I feel for you and it's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10614.048s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I would recommend bringing it up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10617.799s">[Lazzaro]</a>: to school committee asking if you could get something like that on the agenda or speaking to the school superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10622.981s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know it can be super, super frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10625.082s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I have friends with advocates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10626.783s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10627.603s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10628.944s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really unequitable because if you have money, you can hire somebody to either be a tutor or get an advocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10636.286s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10637.847s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a bad system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10639.448s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Literacy is so complicated and difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10641.689s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm really sorry you're going through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11255.542s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I, I, I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11257.804s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are you saying that we shouldn't be accepting English language learners into our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11265.939s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They're expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11266.76s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not going to do back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11269.402s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's not what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11270.503s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're asking questions about the overage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11271.924s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not talking about how English language learners are expensive for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11276.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is a public school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11278.428s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That is not something that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11279.729s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12582.958s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was me, but I was just gonna mention Councilor Lemming's linkage fees, which he mentioned, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13094.83s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13323.546s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm currently serving on the committee that is working on the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13329.331s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And when the MSBA is going to ask us to request a debt exclusion for the new high school, that's gonna be significantly more expensive than what the firehouse will cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13349.486s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that we will be able to come back and ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13353.063s">[Lazzaro]</a>: for another debt exclusion for a firehouse at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13357.825s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it will take longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13359.525s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that there's a possibility that there could be an approved fire station between the two parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13368.469s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Once this debt exclusion, if it is approved, then I think the money will be available and a satisfactory firehouse can be built, or there's the opportunity for it to be built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13381.383s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think time is of the essence because of the limited nature of the timeline, given that we have an urgency of the high school coming down the pike as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13392.292s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have a lot of people in town vying for very large projects heading our direction, and I think we have to balance a lot of people's needs all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13407.964s">[Lazzaro]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3259.366s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing I can say about grants that you can apply for through the EPA and other grant making<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3267.51s">[Lazzaro]</a>: companies, opportunities, foundations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3270.052s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can't fund a city, you can't operate a budget for a city of our size on grants alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3279.077s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It just wouldn't be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3280.417s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there are opportunities for things like that, and it is exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3284.359s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I can definitely say that Alicia Klein and other department heads are utilizing every opportunity that they come across and they are aware of these opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3296.042s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've spoken with Tim McKibben as well about a number of opportunities that they are aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3301.844s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it is something that's being utilized when it's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4071.649s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just one thing I want to add, there's a lot of things at the city level where we have to vote as a city council to authorize funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4082.213s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mean that the money is immediately spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4084.754s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It means that we are authorizing funds to let somebody move forward with a mechanism to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4095.179s">[Lazzaro]</a>: start a project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4096.1s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mean that you're writing a check that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4098.284s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This sort of reminds me of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4100.667s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You're authorizing us to take out a bond as the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4105.615s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So as things move and change, that process continues.<br><br>
