    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=13.0s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=576.579s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Could you talk a little bit more about what you just said about charter schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=580.682s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I was not aware about there being a reimbursement for charter school tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=585.066s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I thought we only paid out for charter school tuition when students attend charter schools that would normally attend Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=664.355s">[Lazzaro]</a>: reimbursements for various things, accounting for the small reimbursement for the charter schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=670.337s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=671.017s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just thought that might be a cool new program I hadn't heard about yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=674.018s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No, it's part of the formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=677.699s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=678.639s">[Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=679.74s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=15.045s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=881.413s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I found them in order and I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1442.774s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1605.209s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5801.769s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5921.756s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to voice my support for this as one of the faster growing minority groups in town, and I just think it's overdue, and I'm eager for this community liaison position to be created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5933.909s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for bringing this to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6258.098s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6273.528s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When is free cash certified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6293.752s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, but the impression I'm getting is that Councilor Scarpelli is concerned that there may be a deadline here about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6305.353s">[Lazzaro]</a>: free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6305.853s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm confused about the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6315.036s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If it's not done before June 30th, it cannot then be made until up to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6321.177s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=249.994s">[Lazzaro]</a>: In order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1073.235s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1076.417s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1079.278s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1081.52s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1598.361s">[Lazzaro]</a>: She doesn't have the stamina.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2172.512s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2672.692s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do have a question about free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2674.092s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Can you explain to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2675.053s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Because my understanding is from when I worked for the superintendent, we would occasionally get free cash allotments to the schools, but it would be at times that we couldn't anticipate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2686.377s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This was with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2688.118s">[Lazzaro]</a>: the current mayor and the prior mayor as well it would be like oh you're getting free cash you know uh ask for ask for what you need but it wouldn't have been budgeted by the school so sometimes free cash would just appear so if this fund is established and then funds that would have previously been in free cash would be part of this now part of this fund<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2720.748s">[Lazzaro]</a>: As is my understanding, the way it is right now, this council has nothing to say about how free cash is allocated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2725.609s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2726.649s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We do approve free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2732.531s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2734.431s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What is the difference between the way free cash is allocated and how a rainy day fund would be allocated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2755.538s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2756.966s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I can just say that from the perspective of the city council my understanding is like our priorities, since we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2764.932s">[Lazzaro]</a>: running for office have been, I've been very upfront about funding the schools as being one of my top priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2771.237s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's always been really important, you know, being, having a really transparent budget and making sure that we're prioritizing those things in the way that we are allocating funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2782.045s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So if there's a mechanism for us to have more transparent access to funds and being able to authorize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2788.985s">[Lazzaro]</a>: be able to allocate funds in a quicker manner than the way the free cash is authorized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2791.947s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's a benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2793.149s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But again, what we're what we would be approving here wouldn't be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2796.892s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any allocation of any funds would only be the opportunity to maybe one day have quicker access to, uh, funds that would be able to be allocated to various city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2806.6s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Correct Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4212.912s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Forgive me, I'm a new councilor, so I didn't see the previous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4224.88s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I wasn't part of the previous conversations about this, so forgive me if you've already answered some of these questions, but what is the mechanism for making sure that it's a specific business on the first floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4235.867s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are you able to verify that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4250.687s">[Lazzaro]</a>: How are you able to verify who, what businesses come in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4254.831s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is it definitely a daycare or is it preference for a daycare or is it daycare office gem exclusively?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4261.176s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If you can speak to that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4286.253s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4286.594s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My only thought would be like a distinct preference for a business versus no business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4294.717s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4295.477s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4296.618s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Otherwise I think this looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7898.13s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7899.951s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that this matters because you're allowed to run for City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7904.776s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If you live in Medford whether you're a renter or a homeowner but I do own my home, and it keeps being brought up so I feel the need to mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7912.143s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My mother was displaced from Medford a couple of years ago because she couldn't afford to buy a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7918.809s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And she couldn't afford her rent anymore in Medford so she moved to the North Shore, she was living in Medford to be close to me and close to my kids, and she was displaced because she couldn't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7929.281s">[Lazzaro]</a>: She's on a fixed income and she's retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7934.58s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I have experience with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7936.702s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know what it's like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7938.063s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also help run the Malden Warming Center, which is a seasonal homeless shelter in Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7944.148s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We don't have a warming center in Medford, but we have guests at the Malden Warming Center who are from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7951.714s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know at least two people who are from Medford, grew up here, went to high school here, and who have families here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7959.184s">[Lazzaro]</a>: whose family had homes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7962.085s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And for various reasons, they became homeless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7965.206s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And the executive director and I were talking this year about how there were so many new guests at the warming center this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7973.228s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I was asking him, what do you think is going on this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7975.689s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's different than last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7977.269s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The weather's not worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7978.309s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7980.919s">[Lazzaro]</a>: doesn't seem significantly different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7982.28s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I wonder why there's so many new guests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7984.021s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And he said, I really think it's the cost of living and the cost of housing in our region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7990.706s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's getting really expensive to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7999.055s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I just think that the affordable housing issue is incredibly important to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8005.661s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's incredibly important that we continue to find diverse streams to continue to fund our, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8044.95s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8045.491s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You've been so horrible tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8047.973s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You've been so I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8055.179s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8062.486s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have run on a platform of affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8067.749s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Matt talked about this at the doors, Anna talked about it at the doors, and I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8071.832s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And Justin did and Zach did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8073.553s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure if George did, but I know that we all ran on it and we won on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8077.496s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And this is important to us and we are going to fight for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8080.618s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we're gonna hear all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8082.079s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we're gonna respectfully hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8084.34s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We always respectfully hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9397.583s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9398.204s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14951.686s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't need to repeat what you said it was just going to be the point of privilege just that this, this doesn't preclude any of the stuff that you mentioned we can do many things at the same time and our goal is always to try as many things as possible and this can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14967.289s">[Lazzaro]</a>: something that specifically targets exactly what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14969.951s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We haven't established what it's going to be yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14972.372s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's only to open up the door to have more conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14975.254s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I love what you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14976.335s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would love for you to send me an email with links so that I can learn more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14982.239s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Because I want to be learning more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14983.92s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It sounds like you have a lot of awesome ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14986.041s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'd love to talk more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14988.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But we're diversifying this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14990.744s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're talking about this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14992.705s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not just this one it's a lot of different options, and it's not targeting anybody individually it's all different ways of doing this and we're trying to keep our, the way that we're approaching this as progressive as possible so that it's not, it's not targeting just people on the bottom, it's helping everybody and it's, and everybody's working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2936.479s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I was going to say a lot of what Vice President Collins did eventually say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2941.786s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that the crux of the issue is that we would hope that the Board of Health would be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2951.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: to approve the majority of one day licenses, similar to what our surrounding cities have in their ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2958.467s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also, I just think there's, just browsing the ordinances, there just isn't enough specificity in there yet for us to make enough, draw enough conclusions about what is and isn't allowed, because there just isn't anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2981.567s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The other thing is some of our local businesses have food trucks, and they may want to operate in the city as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2989.692s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that's an exciting opportunity for them, and we wouldn't want to limit our organizations and our events from having something fun and exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3003.92s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think this is important for us to continue working through, and even though it can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3012.101s">[Lazzaro]</a>: slow and frustrating that we carry on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3016.602s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I would support Vice President Collins' suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=11.0s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1597.56s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1598.36s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate this really clearly very level funded budget here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1605.086s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, things are going up, things are going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1608.249s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's looking almost the same as last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1610.831s">[Lazzaro]</a>: As a new councilor, I have a couple clarifying questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1614.614s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1615.435s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've never really looked at the budget at this scale before, but just to help me understand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1624.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the way that overtime is calculated here, it's gone down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1629.625s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Overtime for officers has gone down by $50,000 from last year's budget, but it's separate from holiday pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1637.309s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Can you help me understand how that's negotiated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1638.93s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is that part of the contract for officers or is it based on something else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1643.913s">[Lazzaro]</a>: How is that and is it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1646.946s">[Lazzaro]</a>: how is overtime calculated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1743.466s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1746.928s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But there is a possibility to kind of schedule creatively to sort of try to tighten up overtime, which sounds like you've been attempting to do, and it looks like you're trying to do with this budget in the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1769.438s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I just very quickly did like, just divided that it would be about, it's budgeted around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1777.824s">[Lazzaro]</a>: $10,700 per officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1779.346s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But is that is is does that usually work out evenly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1783.529s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Or is it it depends on who's on staff that day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1787.111s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Or just it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1833.171s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate that there's a lot of moving parts to this and everything has scales and everybody's trying to fit the puzzle pieces together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1840.177s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciate you coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1843.84s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm trying to understand it all, so thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=799.189s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=801.03s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4357.969s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion to approve the Chapter 74 form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4360.21s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4361.05s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4496.881s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, we should actually, that's a good call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4499.342s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We'll put the science labs in that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4504.563s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I can add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4555.646s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5153.883s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5155.364s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5600.199s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We already have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5651.699s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just a comment sort of similar to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5655.174s">[Lazzaro]</a>: talking about the possibility of greater openness and leaning into the assets of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5663.282s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Something I'd like to mention that we could maybe integrate into section four if we're, I don't know if we're here yet, but community engagement that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5676.519s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do you want me to wait?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6259.293s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Emily, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6263.255s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, so I, I sort of what triggered my thoughts on this was what somebody said about what John was saying about the idea of the school being kind of an open campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6276.879s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6279.415s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to see something in this section that's a little bit about the idea of the space being also kind of a community hub outside of just the high schoolers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6290.303s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there are a lot of community things that happen here, the community schools, the pool, the network, family network, a lot of things happen here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6303.753s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, I mean, and I thought about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6306.621s">[Lazzaro]</a>: obviously, and unfortunately for myself volunteering too, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6310.183s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6313.885s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'd be happy to put that in and integrate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6316.826s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6317.587s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6318.907s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that we have so much space here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6322.469s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I know that in the early days of this building, there were more students and now there are fewer, but that if we do end up changing locations and having a smaller building,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6336.155s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that we sacrifice one of the perks of this large space, which is that there are a lot of opportunities to use it for a lot of different community, a lot of attention for community good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6352.888s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It is doing that now, and it can continue to do it, and it can do even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6357.632s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6447.108s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was in like a, it was in a science club, but it was, that's, that's one of the things they do there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6452.449s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So like, there is a lot of potential and really just in like a city council, like it's a revenue generator to have more of these programs to bring in funds to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6464.911s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And like, these are all, these are all good things for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6469.272s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=29.001s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=29.581s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is the Medford City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee meeting, June 5, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=38.484s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are here to discuss 23-449 offered by Vice President Collins, the resolution to draft the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=50.547s">[Lazzaro]</a>: City Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=71.678s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=73.919s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Three present, two absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=75.921s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=77.281s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this is, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=81.22s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The second or third time we've discussed the wildlife feeding ordinance and I will ask Vice President Collins to take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=286.019s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=288.68s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to pull this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=292.482s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know if it's going to show up on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=297.544s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=299.164s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is that on the main?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=302.205s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=312.913s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is this showing up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=313.675s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is showing up on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=318.885s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=319.346s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, I'll do it on the Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=320.127s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Hold on one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=320.949s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=348.183s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Does that show up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=349.464s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No, still no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=353.048s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry, hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=357.313s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, but it's, just one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=385.915s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming, are you, do you have access to this document?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=392.32s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=393.021s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=395.422s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, great, beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=410.033s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's actually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=415.083s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins has an opinion from AP Law that she's going to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=440.051s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=929.817s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=932.738s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the subject of, I have two thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=937.48s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One is about the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=943.412s">[Lazzaro]</a>: compost and trash receptacles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=948.775s">[Lazzaro]</a>: In my imagining of this, the only, the scenario in which that would be a problem is if a property is in like disrepair, disarray, sort of not being maintained well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=966.809s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that would be like one of maybe a few avenues we would have to say like this property is not being maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=972.293s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And this is an ordinance that says that this is against local rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=977.537s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we should, you know, we can enforce these rules, but the danger is that we'd not make it impossible to follow our ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=994.764s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and also not impossible to enforce them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=997.606s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So being that we are implementing the new composting program, I mean, those, the trash cans, which I would, I think are going to be similar to the ones that are the smaller versions of the trash cans now have lids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1013.677s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it should be that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1015.438s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Like it kind of takes care of itself, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1017.08s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1105.974s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1107.898s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The second thought that I had is I was curious to hear our Board of Health Directors opinion on this, but something that I had brought up in a previous meeting was about feral cats, stray cats, and trapping and either spaying and neutering and releasing or having them become domesticated and like adopting out these cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1135.471s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1136.806s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There are some folks in the area who do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1141.208s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I lost a cat recently, and then I borrowed a trap from somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1145.251s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And so I know that this is something that people do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1148.493s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They weren't from Medford, they were from Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1150.414s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm not outing anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1152.395s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that, Director O'Connor, if you have any, just about if that's something that we would want to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1162.338s">[Lazzaro]</a>: not have be part of this because they do put food inside the traps in order to attract those animals if they know that they're around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1170.764s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And the idea behind it, I believe, is to reduce the population of cats that are in the area because you're, you know, sort of reducing that sort of, it is kind of a nuisance to have like lots of stray cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1187.036s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm curious to hear your perspective, if you wouldn't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1192.33s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I can unmute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1195.172s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1198.794s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1199.294s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1328.701s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1332.042s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other comments before we consider engaging with, would you like to go in and start adding some of these or should we do it separately and kind of come back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1475.049s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1478.79s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any for Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1558.946s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The thing about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1560.728s">[Lazzaro]</a>: the feral cats is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1562.109s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it is such a niche phenomenon and the people that do it are really dedicated and are doing it because they care a lot about this population of animals and they're trying to protect them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1580.784s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And in my very limited experience with it, I think that it is like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1587.31s">[Lazzaro]</a>: a kindness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1589.492s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I do recognize that there could be like neighbor disputes about this and you would want there to be an opportunity for somebody to bring like a conflict somewhere if they needed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1604.223s">[Lazzaro]</a>: However, you don't want as a city to have to litigate every neighbor conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1609.692s">[Lazzaro]</a>: over something that seems relatively innocuous in the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1614.536s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess that's where I'm, that's where in my heart, I'm going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1619.599s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But so my impulse is to sort of stay out of it to whatever degree I can, because I think it's like, it's really probably having limited impact on the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1634.689s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But the fact that the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1640.169s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think if we defined pets and said that cats would be considered pets, I think that would be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1654.121s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think eliminating the possibility that somebody can feed a feral or stray cat is like impossible to say what's a feral or stray cat sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1664.283s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Often they don't wear collars and cats are just walking around and maybe you're feeding somebody, your neighbor's cat that you don't know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1670.607s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Like how much of this are we litigating and how much of it is our responsibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1675.45s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It starts to sort of cross the line into the absurd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1678.852s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I just don't, I don't know how much of that we need to wade into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1685.356s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1775.279s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1775.579s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1852.789s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree with that, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1854.17s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's a good move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1859.371s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other thoughts on any of the other suggested changes from legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1868.714s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing none, on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1871.718s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins' motion to digest the suggestions and then bring this to another meeting in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1882.586s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1884.407s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Did you second, Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1887.99s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1889.171s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1891.272s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1902.396s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1903.637s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Three positive, two absent, motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1910.803s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we will take this up again next month and have some time to address this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1919.79s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Though I would just like to say I appreciate Vice President Collins bringing this in front of this committee and taking the time to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1930.251s">[Lazzaro]</a>: carefully consider it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1934.333s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Every time we write ordinances, we're changing the rules of the city, and it deserves the time and respect that it takes to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1943.458s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we should take the time to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1946.58s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1948.481s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=2009.389s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=2012.25s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=2013.519s">[Lazzaro]</a>: second of Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=2021.243s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=41.179s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=155.577s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=292.078s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=440.954s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, we held a meeting to discuss the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=445.217s">[Lazzaro]</a>: A few things came up, but we decided to keep the paper and committee pending some discussion with city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1430.731s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1432.932s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2059.525s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4394.062s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4395.243s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4396.224s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's so nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4398.686s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate what you presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4400.267s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate everything Vice President Collins said as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4404.57s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is my first budget experience, and it's very reminiscent of what I experienced in the school department when we went through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4414.537s">[Lazzaro]</a>: department by department and discussed in meetings what each department's proposal was and how it would all fit into the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4423.327s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The school department has to present a balanced budget every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4427.451s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And when I worked for the schools, that was what was the expected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4432.937s">[Lazzaro]</a>: experience and I found this this year's budget meetings to be incredibly transparent and incredibly useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4441.102s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just for the public, if you're curious, you can see you can read the notes on all of our budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4446.905s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Everything is available and should illuminate a lot about what we discussed and most of the departments are being level funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4459.151s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is just maintaining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4461.013s">[Lazzaro]</a>: service in a lot of cases or improving service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4463.355s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's, it's, it's, to me, this is a very hopeful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4467.438s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I think it speaks a lot to what our values are as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4471.942s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I, I really think that, uh, this budget says that we care about the infrastructure of our city and about investing in our city and about, um, making sure that our city employees have, uh, their positions and their, uh, environments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4488.796s">[Lazzaro]</a>: funded from a source that's more permanent and that we believe in them and we care about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4494.238s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it also means most significantly because it's the biggest part of the budget that we want to fund our public schools, the teachers and the students that are part of our Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4505.962s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It is the biggest part of the budget and it is incredibly significant that we step up as a community and we dedicate ourselves to making sure that that's our priority and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4517.718s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that Mayor, you hit it right on the head when you said residents deserve the right to take a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4523.302s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not forcing anybody to do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4527.504s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a democratic process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4529.285s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can say yes or no to each of these questions on the ballot in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4534.128s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it's a beautiful thing to be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4538.871s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The fact that it hasn't, we haven't had the opportunity to say yes or no in the past is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4545.962s">[Lazzaro]</a>: a challenge that we've faced this whole time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4547.964s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think this is exciting and hopeful and sets the stage for a great future for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4555.952s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm very excited and I really appreciate everything that you've done for us and all of the work that was done by the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4562.858s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm very excited to see where we go from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4565.601s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4565.861s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4566.141s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14819.099s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14819.799s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know it is late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14821.1s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will try to keep this brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14823.541s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I have worked with many,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14825.831s">[Lazzaro]</a>: people with substance use disorders in my time working at the Malden Warming Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14833.197s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there's been some conversation about something that our body will never approve or not approve, but there's been discussion in our community about a clinic that will offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14854.746s">[Lazzaro]</a>: medication-assisted treatment, medicines for opioid use disorder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14859.889s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And when those conversations are happening, I just thought it would be prudent to bring up something called Stop the Stigma, which is a campaign that highlights that the stigma against people dealing with substance use disorder can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14878.137s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Additionally, damaging to people with substance use disorders and can prevent people from seeking treatment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14884.961s">[Lazzaro]</a>: People in recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14887.782s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Deal with a lot of negative stigma associated with The disease of addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14894.586s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14895.938s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to present this and encourage folks to research this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14904.944s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's very close to my heart and very important to me, and I'd be happy to discuss it at length if people are interested, but I know it is after 11 p.m., and this is the budget meeting, so that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14921.934s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My great hope in presenting this now is only that we recognize that substance use disorder is recognized as a disease by the medical community and that people with that disease are protected, have a protected status and should be considered people with a disability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14942.618s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it's not appropriate to talk about people with a disability in a blanket kind of negative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14951.811s">[Lazzaro]</a>: manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14983.921s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's sort of like how we celebrate Haitian American Flag Day, in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14991.567s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Stop the Stigma doesn't have a day, though during my work in Malden at the Malden Warming Center, there is a day that's celebrated in Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15002.395s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's celebrated in March, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15004.597s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But it's just a it was just decided in as a city to celebrate it on a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15008.96s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we don't we don't do that in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15011.742s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But and this wouldn't be to encourage us to do a day I just wanted to present it as an awareness raising issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15021.988s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Mainly because as a an elected body, we are not approving or not approving the business that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15033.976s">[Lazzaro]</a>: trying to open on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15036.298s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we don't have any ability to like stake a claim in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15043.323s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I did feel that it was a it was something that was important to me to state sort of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15051.977s">[Lazzaro]</a>: the way that we talk about Medford residents and the way that we as a community engage with people with disabilities, people with diseases, and the way that we try to sort of help our residents should be sort of front of mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15066.784s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I just wanted to raise awareness of it as a community issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15753.276s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If I may, since we do not, it's a special permit to approve that space and we are sort of limited in what we're capable of saying yes or no to as far as that clinic opening in that space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15766.581s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's the Community Development Board and then the Zoning Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15771.283s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It really is a matter of referring folks to those meetings and saying, you can review the documents that are on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15779.269s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They're all online with those boards on their, it's the city's website, but it'll be under those umbrellas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15787.375s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But also the Board of Health in Medford is very involved in this kind of work, and I'm sure they would appreciate hearing from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15797.262s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that would be where I would start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15801.004s">[Lazzaro]</a>: because there is a great interest in trying to help people navigate this sort of thing, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15809.93s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I appreciate hearing from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15810.99s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I did get your email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15811.771s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't have a chance to reply to it, but I'll write you back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16423.565s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you to the folks that spoke, and I'm just sorry for your loss, Bill, and anybody who has lost folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16435.277s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very tough thing, and the only point I was making here is that I want us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16441.483s">[Lazzaro]</a>: speak about our residents and our family members and our friends and maybe parents at the Roberts who are currently in recovery and maybe they're walking their kids to school right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16449.965s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe they take methadone or Suboxone and maybe they're just in your community right now as we speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16456.206s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the way that we talk about each other should be respectful and kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16602.78s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1323.382s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1668.181s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2482.352s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think the Department of Public Works committee makes the most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2487.774s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan is the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2490.726s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think because it's to do with traffic, changing the roadways and intersections there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2498.268s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That intersection, it's the one right below the overpass of Route 16, the bridge over the river, right by deep cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2508.951s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very busy intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2510.412s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The Massachusetts Department of Transportation is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2517.921s">[Lazzaro]</a>: in charge of it, but it is really integral to how the center of Medford operates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2525.507s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it's important that we make sure that the community is involved and we have a lot of stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2533.854s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it would be a great opportunity for that committee to have a fruitful discussion and make sure that we're sharing our opinions on how best to address improvements<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4090.52s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Point of information, President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4095.804s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Can we please use the words medical office instead of dispensary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14050.044s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14051.586s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know Councilor Collins has a motion to send it to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14060.194s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm not sure if I can motion to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14115.685s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, my reasoning behind my motion to carry this forward as written is that, sorry, I don't know why there's so much feedback when I use my microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14137.29s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It'll just have to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14138.609s">[Lazzaro]</a>: bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14139.85s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The reasoning behind this is that it is part of a, seems like a pretty comprehensive process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14150.255s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The planning and permitting committee has so much going on with the zoning right now that this feels like it's, we don't have, I don't think we have the capacity to go over it in planning and permitting with any kind of speed or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14169.477s">[Lazzaro]</a>: in any kind of timely manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14170.918s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that's my thinking, just to explain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14226.806s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, how do I, what, it's not motion to present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14231.008s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Approve for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15360.136s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to speak on the appropriation for Medford High School MSBA feasibility study, which is required for us to receive any funding from the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15371.32s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We must do a feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15375.102s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The way that free cash works is that it is calculated based on what was budgeted for the prior year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15386.265s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and what was spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15388.186s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So free cash will come about at various points during the year and if it's not spent, it shows up and is available for the use of the municipality at various points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15403.052s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's why free cash became available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15406.413s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Free cash is being used for this non-negotiable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15412.355s">[Lazzaro]</a>: feasibility study that we must do if we hope to ever have access to Massachusetts School Building Authority funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15424.122s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Since we are shortlisted, I'm on the building committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15427.565s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have been meeting about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15430.106s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This committee, this council must approve this in order to move forward with building a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15438.071s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's imperative that we approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15442.093s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18878.233s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Council is our um, thank you for presenting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18883.877s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18886.61s">[Lazzaro]</a>: agree with what Vice President Collins said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18889.612s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say that it is a difficult thing to present, especially after a decade of no cost of living increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18906.662s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's difficult as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18912.054s">[Lazzaro]</a>: head of a city to propose that you give yourself a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18916.738s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The reason I am in favor of this is because our current mayor will not be our current mayor forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18924.804s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it's the same reason that I was in favor of the raises for our school committee members, which is that every subsequent person that will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18936.055s">[Lazzaro]</a>: become the mayor will have to live on a salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18939.836s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we can't have that position only available to people who are able to live on a salary that is not a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18952.638s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It precludes people who are not independently wealthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18957.219s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So if the person who would like to run for mayor at some future time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18966.496s">[Lazzaro]</a>: they will need to live in Medford, they will need to be able to afford it, and this is what will be required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18971.018s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So going forward, we'll have to make these adjustments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18976.741s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is just what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18979.395s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I appreciate the willingness to put that forward for now and for everybody who will hold these positions in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18988.021s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's challenging because it feels weird, but it's something that we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18992.524s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm in support of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18993.584s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And as Vice President Collins said, I'm also in favor of giving people raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18999.868s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=985.218s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One suggestion, the pink above where your cursor is, can you change the word suffering?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=994.103s">[Lazzaro]</a>: At the June 11th meeting, we passed a resolution to recognize and discuss the Stop the Stigma campaign, which humanizes our neighbors with substance use disorder, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1008.049s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Strike out suffering from and just change it to with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1469.648s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think this is a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1470.789s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also, I like the concept of the one pager as a really accessible length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1479.636s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that maybe if we started, maybe if we had an online document that was a one pager with maybe click through FAQs, because I think it could very quickly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1489.464s">[Lazzaro]</a>: turn into a longer document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1491.545s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Once you get into Robert's rules, when you get into what does it mean to speak through the chair, I think those answers are gonna get longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1501.187s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also think like just the basic information about what our city council based on our charter has under its purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1509.508s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So like the city council is in charge of zoning, approving the budget and ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1516.82s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Those are like the big things that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1519.301s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And those are different from what the mayor's administration does and different from what the school committee does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1525.683s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And these are the three biggest branches of our local government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1531.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But, you know, maybe working in conjunction with the mayor's office and the school committee to help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1541.076s">[Lazzaro]</a>: residents understand what those differences are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1543.777s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So if they need to do something that doesn't fall under the umbrella of the city council, that they can go to one of those different departments to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1553.142s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I find often that people will come to city council for something that might be a mayor's administration issue or a city issue that's under like public works or something like that, or a school committee issue, really it's something about like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1569.045s">[Lazzaro]</a>: something that's being taught in the schools or something to do with a teacher or something to do with the school administration that's really a school committee issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1577.715s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that being said, I do think a one-pager is great, but that maybe there can be something that's like a longer thing that we can go to, whether that's online or on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1937.151s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do also wonder if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1943.103s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This may not be what we're talking about tonight, but I think that there might be a benefit to a guide for people who are coming in for their first council meeting, hoping to speak on an agenda item, and they don't know how or when or how to go about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1962.114s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it can be really intimidating, not knowing where to sit, not knowing who everybody is, what is a clerk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1970.325s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You know, like genuinely, these are confusing processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1974.813s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So part of me wonders about like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1978.041s">[Lazzaro]</a>: maybe it's a second, oh, sorry, maybe it's a second one pager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1981.183s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's like, so this is your first council meeting and you would like to speak on an agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1991.508s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Here's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1993.409s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I would, if that's like more than you would wanna do, I would be happy to draft something if we end up wanting to maybe address that, because I think it would be separate from an introduction to the work of the council, what the council does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2009.005s">[Lazzaro]</a>: because that might be a separate thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2012.407s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2234.025s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Well, we went through the social media guidelines for City Council social account, so we could post from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2244.659s">[Lazzaro]</a>: if we wanted into, you know, Facebook groups or Reddit and just solicit using maybe a Google form, like what of the following would you be interested in learning about first, what would be the most important and present it like a survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2262.307s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We could even have it attached to the newsletter when that goes out, like a link to the survey, if we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2517.696s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do think streamlining this simplifying us is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2528.109s">[Lazzaro]</a>: in our interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2530.03s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think I would fall on the side of, like I suggested the other way, but I would fall on the side of drafting something and then asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=755.421s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=758.883s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=761.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1503.817s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1506.018s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The Public Health and Community Safety Committee is handling a couple of active issues right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1515.42s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We did briefly address a proposal for a warming and cooling center that I offered early in this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1524.202s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We had a discussion about what that would entail, what is needed to open a facility like that in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1534.153s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it was just sort of broad strokes conversation beginning the discussion and early navigation of how that could look as time passes, the most pertinent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1553.407s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Part of that conversation remains space and how what space would be available and how, how we would access it and obviously also cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1567.223s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Somerville and Revere that fund warming centers via their municipalities and their city budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1577.17s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It costs about $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1578.191s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And they use municipal spaces that they have access to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1584.496s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that's the next step of that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1588.199s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1592.842s">[Lazzaro]</a>: have a couple of things that are sort of haven't been addressed yet that are on this list, but this isn't quite up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1600.331s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think this document maybe I could probably do some updating because we have discussed a few times the wildlife feeding ordinance in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1610.894s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I should communicate about that and update this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1614.156s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know this document is ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1621.199s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1622.76s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we've talked about the wildlife feeding ordinance, and that is on its way in the direction, I think, of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1636.789s">[Lazzaro]</a>: completion, but it's not quite there yet still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1639.992s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1640.793s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I believe the place that we're at with that is waiting on some responses from city staff, the animal control department, so that we can move forward with bringing it back to a regular meeting and passing that ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1653.925s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1656.633s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There are a couple of other things, you know, the interesting thing about this document to me as a new Councilor is that it's, it was sort of difficult for me to anticipate what might show up on this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1670.621s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I wasn't certain coming in what things were going to appear before us and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1680.899s">[Lazzaro]</a>: what we wanted to have happen and what ends up happening are two different things, kind of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1685.603s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm interested to see, you know, how everything continues to develop, but there are a couple of things that I know, even just in the last meeting that are going to show up on, in different committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1700.314s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, these, this could use a light bit of updating, and I know the wildlife feeding ordinance being added to the public health community safety committee would be one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1711.52s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, so that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1714.902s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, one other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1715.662s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We did talk about the, we got the update on surveillance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1720.966s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The surveillance report was updated in that committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1725.088s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2952.962s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8937.621s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree with what President Vares was saying, and I would like to additionally point out that I think that a report would be great to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8945.832s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that the checks and balances that exist at the state level and at the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8951.532s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that the city wouldn't have been able to access the funds to pay out, you know, legal fees and things like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8961.902s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There are, you know, blocks in the way of that happening without our knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8966.747s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So for example, some of the things that Mr. South mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8970.543s">[Lazzaro]</a>: he just said them a couple of times and there was one, it was just one, like Mrs. Gayle's case, he said it two times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8978.468s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That was, you know, it's, we have the things that are here and we are, I would be happy to see them all listed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8985.993s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8988.095s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that conflating what we're talking about here with other votes that we're taking about raises for people who work in City Hall or other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9000.823s">[Lazzaro]</a>: elements of the operations of the city that are unrelated, I think, is unfair and unreasonable and not what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9008.567s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10533.195s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=622.402s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, there it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=628.785s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=630.305s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=632.486s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, was I muted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=633.227s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=633.607s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=633.947s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=634.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, this meeting will come to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=637.108s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is the public health and community safety committee, August 13th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=640.81s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, uh, clerk, can you call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=645.252s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have one member on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=661.548s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=662.329s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That is four present, one absent, and this meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=667.092s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Today we are talking about 23-449 offered by Vice President Collins, resolution to draft wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=675.578s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This paper has been in this committee for a little while and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=681.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The Health Director, Animal Control Officer, Code Enforcement Officers, and a representative of KP Law are invited to attend this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=688.129s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And Vice President Collins, if you would like to talk about where we have come since our last meeting and where we're going now and what we still have to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=875.347s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=876.328s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are you able to pull up the, yeah, and do the track changes there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1425.137s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1446.765s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe because of the intention of this ordinance being about feeding and not really about like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1453.291s">[Lazzaro]</a>: the other procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1454.031s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, the vaccination isn't really about feeding either, but that is often the intention of the capture of the feral cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1463.093s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But the vaccination against rabies is a more direct animal control, though so is spaying and neutering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1471.436s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1472.476s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Did that come up in your discussion with Kitty Connection or with the animal control officer at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1606.698s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1608.099s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate your thorough work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1610.901s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I have one question about Chapter 6, Article 3, Section 6 through 110.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1615.745s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I may have missed this in your description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1620.168s">[Lazzaro]</a>: the registration of feral cat caretaker, is that, sorry, is that our, that's our ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1626.75s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We already have that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1627.77s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That exists already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1629.791s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, no, you don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1630.711s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If it's already on the books, then great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1633.272s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1635.272s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I love that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1639.005s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1639.765s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1641.266s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So does anybody have any responses or questions or follow-ups?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1644.168s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we need to change the language here in section E to include something about spaying and neutering or is it not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1651.191s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's neither here nor there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1653.132s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1656.734s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1717.044s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any motions on the floor about perhaps moving this to, yes, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1752.079s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Director O'Connor, thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1801.038s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1993.04s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1995.662s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1998.664s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's actually a good note for us going forward that we should be avoiding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2003.047s">[Lazzaro]</a>: using language like or his or her designee, because I think we do that a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2010.357s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And just be really specific about who is in charge of enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2014.763s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that is good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2017.353s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So do we, yes, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2058.613s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins to adopt the edits and move this paper to the regular council meeting, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2074.838s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2077.84s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2077.94s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2104.403s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, that is five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, and the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2109.026s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2112.648s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan to adjourn the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2119.412s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2135.992s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2139.142s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=313.459s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=314.28s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So September is the month that we spend celebrating folks who are in recovery from substance use disorder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=324.548s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a great time to understand how difficult that journey can be and how wonderful life can be in recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=334.716s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There are a number of ways that people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=339.864s">[Lazzaro]</a>: celebrate that, but I wanted to make sure that it was something that we were aware of as a council and as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=345.209s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I spoke with the Board of Health in Medford and there's Medford Overcoming Addiction and our Board of Health department is very active in this space as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=357.841s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm just grateful for all the folks that I know who are in recovery and that they've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=364.267s">[Lazzaro]</a>: actively on this journey, and I'm happy to be able to celebrate that here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=370.872s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=731.167s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=731.788s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We meant to discuss what I think will be the final discussion on the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=738.871s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Nailed down the last details of that, and then we will be discussing it today in our regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3227.2s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins stole some of my things that I was going to say, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3231.482s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That was very concise and well put.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3234.763s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing I did want to mention was that this is an amendment to a previously approved contract, as Vice President Collins mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3243.568s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this was something that was already agreed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3247.324s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We've, we've said many times curb to curb being the industry standard so nobody ever says median.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3253.908s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I can also say I have, I live on a street that had work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3258.05s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it was before the past five years, and there was a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3263.352s">[Lazzaro]</a>: gas line that was replaced by National Grid under my street, and only half of our street was paved, which means there's a seam in the middle of the street, which means that there is already deterioration in the center of the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3279.292s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's why it's important that we carry on the paving from one end of the street to the other end of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3285.673s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Main street being an extremely busy road, that intersection being complicated to drive through as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3291.794s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have the police station, we have a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3295.355s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's very busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3296.195s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I wouldn't want to put our residents in any kind of situation where they would be facing any more complicated or dangerous scenarios at that intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3308.607s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think it's pretty clear to me that this is not something I would want to risk safety or cost in the future, but I appreciate the opportunity to look into it more in depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3321.91s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3520.124s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If we table this amendment, does it delay the work that is scheduled, any work that is scheduled or anything that needs to- I don't know, but that's-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3662.474s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=715.689s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=718.529s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I couldn't agree with you more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=720.11s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The Haitian community in Medford is so critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=724.65s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And when that was said by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=728.208s">[Lazzaro]</a>: candidate for president of the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=730.23s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was so, it really hits home in Medford to me because so many of our friends here are Haitian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=742.058s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The people that come to America from Haiti are here legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=746.982s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They're, not that there's whatever, but it's like something that I learned when I worked for the superintendent who is Haitian American herself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=758.226s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and grew up in Medford and his family still lives in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=760.927s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And she told me that the most common languages that we need translation services for are Portuguese for our Brazilian American folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=774.931s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And the second most common is Haitian Creole, not French, it's the Haitian dialect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=782.031s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And then it's Arabic, and then it's Spanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=784.835s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was very interesting to me, and those were the people that we were hiring to do translation services for people that could translate to those languages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=793.342s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very big population in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=796.164s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My daughter's best friend when she was in daycare and pre-K was a little girl who was Haitian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=803.048s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My husband plays in a 90s cover band with a Haitian guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=808.251s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are like, one of the best restaurants in Medford is a Haitian restaurant called the Neighborhood Restaurant, which if you haven't been there is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=817.917s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They catered our Juneteenth celebration here in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=822.691s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it was really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=824.272s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it is the fabric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=826.413s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The Haitian community is part of what makes Medford unique and special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=831.035s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I just think that the support that we can show to a community that might be feeling upset now is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=840.499s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=843.24s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's important that we just say out loud that this is not accurate or true and we voice our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1405.388s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I found them in order and motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1476.563s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2262.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate your effort to compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2265.306s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think we've already, we have what was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2268.877s">[Lazzaro]</a>: a suggestion to move from 11 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2270.559s">[Lazzaro]</a>: to 3 a.m., and this is a compromise that's offered, I think we should vote on this compromise that was offered, and if it's not enough of a compromise, then maybe that's a no vote, but if, I will also say I grew up in a town that was extremely suburban and residential, and there were multiple 24-hour diners, which I loved, so we don't have any of those here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2292.919s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there are some people who have working hours that are different than a nine to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2300.202s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that having the opportunity to eat later because you have different working hours or a different lifestyle is something that I think we should be allowing our residents to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2313.607s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I would be inclined to vote yes on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2653.523s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I definitely support this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2655.944s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's really critical to offer very basic, I mean, it's a human function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2664.409s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It is also, it contributes to the, how do I phrase this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2674.505s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If you're somebody who, there are sort of default mechanisms in cities and towns sometimes where people who are unhoused will be criminalized for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2685.794s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And if you have public restrooms, that cuts down on the likelihood of that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2690.698s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that is really beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2694.121s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also just think, you know, we should make people's lives easier and better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2698.805s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's the business of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2700.286s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this is a great way to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2703.548s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've had many experiences as a parent where just sheer panic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2709.411s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this would be a really wonderful, a wonderful addition to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2712.953s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So definitely looking into what the costs would be, how we would save money over time, I think would be a great thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2719.536s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So looking forward to discussing it further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4460.255s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4463.177s">[Lazzaro]</a>: In a vote, when you sever, are you voting separately for each of the two things, or are you only gonna vote on one of the things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4476.686s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=40.265s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=41.946s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that is two papers, 24-036, Resolution to Discuss an Overgrowth Ordinance and 24-461,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=53.686s">[Lazzaro]</a>: resolution to meet and discuss updates to the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=57.69s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And if Director O'Connor would like to speak on these, they definitely do go hand in hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=64.017s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for that clarification, Vice President Collins and Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=309.648s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=514.246s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Before you go on, Vice President Collins, can you explain the difference between overgrowth on a residential property versus a commercial property versus something that may be like protected space that is natural space, I'm thinking, maybe along the Mystic River or in the fells, and why certain kinds of spaces are more susceptible to rodent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=541.775s">[Lazzaro]</a>: increases in rodent population versus, I don't think that, this is sort of instinctual for me, I don't have data to back this up, but I think that this is true, that the fells and the area by the river isn't necessarily increasing rat populations or raccoons or things like that, because they're drawn to human waste or that this sort of human generated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=570.265s">[Lazzaro]</a>: spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=570.705s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So if you could, if you or it may be a question for Director O'Connor too, but I'd be curious to hear a little bit more about that because overgrowth isn't the same as natural, you know, nature just taking its course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=658.624s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's important to note that this isn't an issue of the visual appeal of a property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=664.285s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It is only when there is a problem, just like what we talked about with the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=672.527s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not a problem until it's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=676.427s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And every time you sort of say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=681.035s">[Lazzaro]</a>: you know, it's natural for us to think through the unintended consequences of something like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=685.539s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And, you know, that's the important thing to note that this is a mechanism for when something becomes an issue, if we don't have an avenue to suggest that this is causing a problem, and there's a way for us to fix it, then we need to create an avenue to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=754.499s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Director O'Connor, would you be willing to speak to how the rodent population differs in a city versus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=764.335s">[Lazzaro]</a>: a natural landscape, just for my edification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=835.454s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=836.114s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=836.875s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And again, it's not a nuisance until it's a nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=839.637s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=841.178s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins, I'll let you continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=842.938s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to catch that moment before we moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1040.462s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, are there any other comments from members about, yes, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1229.053s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1283.076s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other comments from councilors about the prospect of Vice President Collins drafting the ordinance and then coming back with, you know, we can discuss the particulars<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1301.676s">[Lazzaro]</a>: once that's drafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1305.138s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we want to, before we vote on that, I have a thought about, so would we wanna talk about the rodent control ordinance and updating that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1315.924s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1662.446s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we know is this a revolving fund or is it something else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1673.561s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1675.904s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1857.099s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And Vice President Collins, would you be able to email this information to the rest of the, to the committee so that we can just have it after the meeting, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2363.26s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2368.803s">[Lazzaro]</a>: just a thought because I have a sense that Vice President Collins is going to make a motion to also draft this ordinance that maybe this could be spread around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2383.733s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You wanna just do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2386.334s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All right, I'm gonna leave it alone because I'm not allowed to make motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2391.537s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2456.175s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is there any other discussion from members of the council on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2461.657s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming seconded this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2485.911s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2489.733s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any discussion on those before we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2492.814s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2493.795s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you call the roll once you have it written?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2511.111s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2512.571s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2514.352s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2515.693s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So Vice President Collins will draft those and we can bring them to the next meeting and discuss them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2524.017s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate the work you've done on this so far and just a little bit of general cleanup and housekeeping for our town and our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2535.698s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it's not glamorous work, but you've created a lane for yourself, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2542.963s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Don't say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2544.484s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Don't say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2546.245s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It has to be done, and we're grateful to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2550.988s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So is there any, or is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2554.591s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2555.151s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Vice President Collins, before we...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2581.101s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2581.982s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Director O'Connor, a solver of problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2583.903s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We really appreciate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2589.886s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2591.927s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins to adjourn, all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2595.849s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2598.01s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2599.371s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=318.229s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know we're casual in the committee meetings, but, um, the, uh, one comment about the public health and community safety committee, um, the, I appreciate the ordinance will allow the city to step in if and only if there's a problem that neighbors are complaining about, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=338.308s">[Lazzaro]</a>: For example, it specifically allows people to have bird feeders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=341.751s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure, so, and maybe I'm too close to this discussion since I was leading all of the meetings and I feel like the wildlife feeding ordinance is something that, because I discussed it at great length, I feel like I would want to say more than this, but I don't want the newsletter to be overrun with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=366.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: our back and forth discussions of the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance, but I think I would wanna say the purpose of the ordinance is to avoid, I think we can be more direct about what it was about, which was that it was like, in that committee, we drafted and thoroughly discussed the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=395.916s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, which, you know, can you just tell me verbatim what, uh, yeah, I think I'm just thinking about like what, what it should say, and I'm not ready for it to be verbatim just yet, but I'd like to hear sort of your thoughts as I say them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=408.406s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I think I would just want to say that the point of it was to, um, make sure that folks are not feeding wild animals intentionally aside from birds using bird feeders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=422.898s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think you can say that in one sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=428.223s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it would be something that you could, what's the word I'm looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=437.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Something that you could enforce, that's the word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=441.629s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This ordinance would be something that you could enforce only if there are complaints about a nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=449.393s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Something that would be enforced only if there were complaints about a nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=455.543s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I guess I'm just I'm trying to simplify and be like a little bit more specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=474.688s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=478.589s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=480.569s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=480.869s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And then I think we can cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=482.91s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And then I think you can cut from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=488.77s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And then I think you can say it allows people to have bird feeders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=546.4s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would fully concur with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=564.861s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The overgrowth ordinance, we just are beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=567.823s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Well, we did begin discussing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=569.965s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Actually, and that was this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=571.506s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Wait, did we begin discussing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=573.947s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=575.248s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Did we refer it to committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=576.569s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm all turned around now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=579.011s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, we did discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=582.333s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We did discuss that this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=584.735s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=585.115s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Overgrowth, and that's also rodent related.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=603.737s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, so on that note, yeah, we can add in the overgrowth in that case because we did just talk about that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=613.099s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that really encompasses how much intentionality there is in that committee and in the council overall in the partnership with the Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=692.566s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And then begin the discussion of overgrowth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=695.747s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=698.583s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The agenda's there, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=700.544s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Make doubly sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=704.245s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It does begin to blend together sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=711.046s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I think in that meeting we had two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=722.489s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, it was an update to the rodent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=725.836s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we had, right, because the wildlife feeding had already been approved and it was in first reading at the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=734.478s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this was two additional ordinances that we were addressing to further hone the rodent control measures in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=743.621s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So maybe we have two bullet points under public health and community safety and they're all rodent related.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=902.172s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's more like... And we don't have to spend forever on this, but... Maybe we can take that whole thing out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=914.837s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe we don't need an intentionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=917.093s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, we did, we put the purpose at the top, so we can, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=921.157s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I think that's enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1948.975s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I think what Councilor Tseng was suggesting is you could almost say passing resolutions, ordinances, and zoning regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1957.464s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That could be the first bullet, and then you could define all of those at the bottom in a little quick way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1964.326s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do want to say, I kind of like that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1967.428s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do want to say generally, and I was kind of alluding to this before the meeting began, but you all weren't privy to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1973.913s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was, I think the way we have to think about the way that we're communicating with the public via this committee and as individuals, and just because we're a thousand blossoms blooming in the city, everybody takes in information in such a wide variety of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1994.557s">[Lazzaro]</a>: To me, this would be absolutely, I would be completely unable to comprehend this piece of paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2002.261s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I understand what it is now because I've done this work, but because of the way my brain operates and because of how quickly my eyes would gloss over looking at it, I think it's really useful for somebody who finds it really interesting and can process information without being actively involved in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2024.008s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think if we print it out and laminate it and put it on the walls, it'll be useful for the sort of people that are interested in receiving information in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2031.455s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think the way that we think about it should be like giving information in a wide variety of different ways to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2039.882s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think I'm sort of, as a courtesy to everybody,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2044.798s">[Lazzaro]</a>: have to remove myself from having this conversation because I'm like, I don't understand who would ever receive information in this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2050.581s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know somebody does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2052.362s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I am not that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2054.303s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would need it to be like, on a bulletin board at like a children's section of a library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2060.006s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Like big words and like, what's an ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2063.228s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Like a worm explains it to me as it crawls out of an apple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2066.209s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Like, it's so confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2068.751s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And Robert's rules took me a long time to figure out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2071.232s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's true for a lot of people, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2074.234s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But this stuff is all super true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2076.015s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I couldn't believe you fit it all in a piece of paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2078.176s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2080.598s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it is, like, very applicable to the work that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2084.48s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I kind of think that, like, this being, like, the most critical, most useful stuff that comes up every single time, almost, is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2094.071s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And for the people that it's going to work for, it's going to work really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2096.793s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think we have to be super nitpicky about it, because again, like for the people that are going to read it, they're going to be like, wow, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2103.416s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And if we put it up on the walls, and even I think also maybe having a few copies for people to hang on to, especially if it's a long meeting and they're waiting for their turn, and they can maybe hang on to eliminated copy and like look through it while they wait, that would be really useful too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2116.963s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But it does make me think like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2119.4s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What are the ways that we can present this in like bigger words, like easily accessible for people that maybe have a different like neuro-processing way of doing things, like maybe I do, a lot of people I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2134.109s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So like that kind of thing would be an interesting thing to discuss as like a next step too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2139.453s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But thank you so much, Justin, or Councilor Tseng, for putting this together because it is super thorough and for what it is, really clear, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2374.718s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it looks really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2376.16s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, again, I really appreciate the work you've done, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2380.677s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I especially like how to participate that sort of outlines the ways that if you're in the chambers, if you're on Zoom, we've had people with a lot of confusion about how to participate on Zoom, the raise hand, the ask, I've asked you to unmute, like that kind of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2394.783s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But yeah, just the, I think it's really good for where we're at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2402.907s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think we should move ahead and, you know, see if we can get it out in the room<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2409.397s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I would motion to move that process forward however we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2413.619s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If we need to get it approved by the full council, I would motion that we bring it to the full council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2580.365s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, the motion is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2584.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: refer this paper, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2588.606s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Refer the paper to the regular meeting subject to the edits that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=62.657s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=124.614s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=125.114s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So per the Medford Bike Commission, I wanted to hold this committee meeting and give them an opportunity to have a public discussion about this intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=138.924s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Unfortunately, our representative from MassDOT was not available to meet, but he did send an email that I'd like to read<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=147.891s">[Lazzaro]</a>: into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=149.132s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I believe that they'll be able to have another meeting there early in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=154.774s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it was important for us to make sure that we were able to get these notes on the record from the bike commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=163.777s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They're like 25% planning, and they do sort of public feedback, they factor in the feedback, they go back to planning, they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=174.54s">[Lazzaro]</a>: do another sort of public meeting session, and then they do the next phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=180.284s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So Greg Fraser is the project manager for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=186.949s">[Lazzaro]</a>: To give some context, this is the intersection of Main Street and Route 16 as it goes sort of under the bridge where Route 16 goes over Main Street by the Mystic River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=201.82s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=203.636s">[Lazzaro]</a>: well-traveled intersection, and it's also pretty dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=207.88s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's right by the, well, it's not like, it has potential to be problematic, let's say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=217.587s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's right across from the Medford Police Department headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=221.49s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have a fire station there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=222.651s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have many medical offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=224.933s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have lots of businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=226.995s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's heavily traveled, and it's an intersection of many different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=233.211s">[Lazzaro]</a>: modes of transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=234.452s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, uh, the message that I got from Greg Frazier was, um, sorry for a master.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=241.857s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=242.237s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Project manager for this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=244.659s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He said, I have sent the 25% submission to Todd Blake, who is our, as we know, our, um, city, uh, our what's Todd's title.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=255.046s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Todd's here on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=256.167s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He can tell me his title.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=257.088s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He'll speak in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=257.808s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and I've sent out a scheduling poll to meet with the city of Medford bike advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=263.345s">[Lazzaro]</a>: MassDOT highway design complete streets Todd Blake and the consultant Howard Stein Hudson to discuss the design further as agreed upon following the public informational meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=272.728s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting will allow further discussions now that the design team has had an opportunity to further investigate the design following written comments received from the committee as well as other constituents following the public informational meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=286.892s">[Lazzaro]</a>: With<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=287.765s">[Lazzaro]</a>: further discussions as at the upcoming meeting, the design team will only have more opportunity to further look into design prior to going to a design public hearing and then continuing further in design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=298.892s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that that's his statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=300.853s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's I, my understanding is there's intention to have this be a really fluid process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=306.036s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They're not going to break ground for quite a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=308.538s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, so I found that encouraging, but I will go, uh, if I may to, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=318.064s">[Lazzaro]</a>: uh, Emily O'Brien, who is here on Zoom, uh, if that's through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=323.887s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, she's the, uh, president of our president of our Medford bike commission, and she and I met and spoke at length about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=333.252s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And, um, she outlined the thoughts and, um, concerns that the bike commission had with the plans as they were at the earliest stages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=342.657s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, uh, I would love to hear her, um, perspective on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=348.137s">[Lazzaro]</a>: this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=977.722s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=979.844s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There are a few things that I want to highlight in what Emily said, which are that efficiency of cyclists is not just a matter of cyclists getting to work on time, but it's also the fact that we want to make our streets<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1003.45s">[Lazzaro]</a>: we want to make it easy to follow the laws of our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1006.693s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If we make it too difficult to follow the laws, then it just becomes more logical for people to break the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1014.959s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And then cyclists are like anybody and they would just go around it and it becomes a dangerous situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1023.666s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And sometimes when you're on a bike, I can speak for myself because I ride a bike sometimes, but I get scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1030.1s">[Lazzaro]</a>: of something that could happen to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1031.562s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If I have to go too slow, it's more likely that I'll wobble, lose my balance and have to step down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1037.088s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And then if I step down in the middle of the street, I become, it becomes very dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1043.516s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My daughter learned how to ride her bike recently and now she wants to ride her bike everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1046.898s">[Lazzaro]</a>: She's seven years old and she's often like really wobbly and she wants to ride her bike to CVS to buy candy all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1053.622s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm afraid to ride to the CVS on High Street because there's nowhere to ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1057.684s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's like cars packed real tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1061.486s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that's on the way to, you know, this connection here with, you know, 16 and Main Street and it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1067.583s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If we had to slow down too much, it would be scary and wobbly and, you know, it's easier to ride on the sidewalk, but when people are walking their dogs, it's not a safe space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1078.332s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I wanted to mention is there was a deadly accident recently in Cambridge where it was a shared space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1086.478s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not the same situation, but it was on Memorial Drive, I believe, and it was like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1095.297s">[Lazzaro]</a>: a bike path that merges into a sidewalk and they become a shared space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1100.159s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And people have been talking for a long time about how dangerous it is and something that had been on the radar of people wanting to change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1109.402s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But we don't want to increase the opportunity for fatalities to happen, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1115.864s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So all of that being said, I know that we sometimes these kinds of meetings can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1123.78s">[Lazzaro]</a>: move forward things that are maybe going to happen anyway but you know can increase the urgency so now that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1140.936s">[Lazzaro]</a>: the bike commission will have a meeting with MassDOT that is excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1144.997s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And maybe some of this doesn't need to be as pressing that we discuss it right now, but I do, I would offer director Blake, if you have any, any response or anything you would want to add to the discussion that might be something that we wouldn't have thought of necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1162.041s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would, I would love to hear from you if you have anything that you'd like to add to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1213.694s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's very encouraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1216.495s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1219.536s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1219.896s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I am happy to hear that the meetings are going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1225.117s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm comfortable with how this is moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1260.72s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I think that it would have something to do with the progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1265.544s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They have a very specific, I think there's a specific route that they have to take based on, sorry, the... Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1278.676s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1279.477s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1715.911s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I was just gonna motion to adjourn when you are finished with your thankings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=189.68s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=190.441s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We held a discussion of two papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=195.459s">[Lazzaro]</a>: resolution to discuss an overgrowth ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=198.58s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This was a new ordinance 24-036.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=203.042s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We discussed that in conjunction with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=209.848s">[Lazzaro]</a>: resolution to meet and discuss updates to the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=213.551s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's 24-461.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=215.892s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We talked about these two ordinances together because it was like a way to have a kind of a comprehensive view of managing the rodent situation in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=228.26s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Kind of goes hand in hand with what we've been discussing with a wildlife feeding ordinance in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=233.223s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And both papers are staying in committee and Vice President<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=239.441s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Collins will be drafting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=240.822s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um those ordinances and then bringing them to the committee again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=245.125s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=466.992s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I saw somebody in the building he was looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=471.195s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He showed me on his phone that he was looking for the space to talk about this, but I don't see him here, but I think he may be in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=682.801s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=683.281s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Our city participates in the pilot program with Tufts University, which is an agreement where Tufts pays a portion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=699.464s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Instead of taxes, it pays fees to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=703.82s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that do not equal the amount of money that they would pay were they to pay property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=709.105s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But there is an exchange of services, significant services offered by Tufts and significant services offered by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=720.637s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I learned recently that Tufts decided to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=725.962s">[Lazzaro]</a>: take a pause on their Neighborhood Fellows Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=728.644s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One of the participants this year is Chelli Keshavan, who is a very active community member in Medford, who brought it to my attention and asked that we ask Tufts, or a representative from Tufts to come and speak to us and explain the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=748.958s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Nobody from Tufts was available tonight, but I do have a statement from Brock Roderico, who is the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=756.383s">[Lazzaro]</a>: government and community relations executive director at Tufts University, which I'm going to read the email he sent me sort of explaining the agreement with Tufts that we enjoy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=769.556s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He said, as we discussed, Tufts University provides many payments programs and services to Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=775.883s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The neighborhood fellows program is not one of those programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=778.7s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It is open to applicants, regardless of where they live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=781.723s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This program is not part of the pilot agreement or the community benefits report that we provide to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=787.528s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Most participants do not live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=789.91s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Tufts University pays $1,426,148 in property taxes each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=796.355s">[Lazzaro]</a>: In addition, this is for buildings that are like housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=801.079s">[Lazzaro]</a>: In addition to those property tax payments, we also make an annual payment in lieu of taxes pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=806.246s">[Lazzaro]</a>: in the amount of $450,000 to the city of Medford, and we report all our community benefits to our Medford-Somerville Community Benefits Report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=814.092s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Those benefits come to more than $6 million each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=817.234s">[Lazzaro]</a>: A copy of the report can be found on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=819.796s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We did share that link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=822.278s">[Lazzaro]</a>: For the Joyce Cummings Center on College Avenue, Tufts University pays an annual pilot payment of $250,000 each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=829.244s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The Starbucks in the JCC also generates property tax revenue for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=835.402s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I did also want to invite some folks from the Neighborhood Fellows Program to speak on the program and what is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=848.216s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When I spoke with Rocco, he did say that the plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=854.275s">[Lazzaro]</a>: as of now, was for them to pause enrollment in the program temporarily, allow the folks that are enrolled right now to finish the program, and then reassess how acceptances would work going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=869.361s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I have had meetings with current and former participants in the program, which it's a very interesting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=875.584s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's how it works right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=879.014s">[Lazzaro]</a>: is that people are accepted into the program as mid-career, like active community organizers, people who are change makers, who kind of come in and get a master's in public policy through Tufts University while they're actively leading in their communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=902.604s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Most people are from the Boston area, Chelli is from Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=907.369s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But people are from Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, all around the region, Lawrence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=914.532s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But there are people who are actively leading in their communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=918.773s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very diverse program in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=922.774s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's something that may be discontinued, maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=926.696s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's unclear right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=928.336s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's sort of in flux.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=929.517s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But members of the program who are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=934.161s">[Lazzaro]</a>: part of the program right now and former members of the program, but alumni of the program, were interested in, I think that by the nature of who they are, because they're community activists, are trying to talk about ways to continue the program, keep it alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=951.088s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I thought it was especially prudent that we discuss it because it's a program that cultivates<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=960.85s">[Lazzaro]</a>: stronger and better leadership in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=964.713s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And even if it is not officially listed as part of the community benefits that Medford gets from the pilot program, I do think it is a valuable program for our community and our surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=979.933s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, but I would, I would, uh, offer that, uh, if there is somebody from the program, it would be nice to hear from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1288.005s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would be happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1288.846s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would make the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1329.605s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will say the, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1332.887s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1335.508s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The link that was shared has some fairly robust<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1343.675s">[Lazzaro]</a>: estimates and it's available on the Tufts website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1345.976s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I would encourage folks to take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1349.817s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a PDF called 2023 Tufts University Community Benefits Report for the cities of Medford and Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1356.26s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a PDF that maybe we can share as part of the minutes or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1363.362s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But it is, it's a yearly report that I believe Tufts puts out that is the sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1372.054s">[Lazzaro]</a>: accounting of their estimation of like the exchange.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1378.68s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's fair to say it's like a guess of what that monetary value would be, but it's things like, well, one thing is undergraduate financial aid for students who are from Somerville and Medford, which I think I would argue they would probably give to those students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1398.61s">[Lazzaro]</a>: In any way, I used to work in financial aid at universities and it was common practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1404.555s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If you accepted a student, they had to earn that place at the university by being academically viable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1411.74s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it was in the interest of the university to make it possible for the student to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1416.464s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So like, I'm not sure that's something that you would necessarily say, but all of these things like there is a monetary value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1422.128s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1425.014s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But yes, I think those are valid questions and I would motion to include them as a amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1435.24s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1500.785s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He, not no, in sort of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1508.528s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's, I would speak more, I wouldn't feel comfortable speaking on that because it's not really my, it's not up to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2033.772s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure that we need to discuss it on committee further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2036.314s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that we could have further conversations with Mr. Jurico.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2040.777s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He's our government liaison at the university, and we often have really great discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2048.102s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He's a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2050.649s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He's very responsive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2051.53s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He's a good guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2052.892s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think we could handle this without it going to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2055.354s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So just motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3192.847s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm also in favor of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3193.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3196.568s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I have been to the Senior Center for a Listening Session with Councilor Leming before, and we had a great experience there, though it was a small turnout, but small and mighty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3209.471s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We had a great conversation, but my hesitation with the wording of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3217.067s">[Lazzaro]</a>: resolution is that if we are to if we're going to do a committee of the whole, I think it would probably just be open to the public, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3224.452s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So anybody who has any questions, it could be any group of people that is curious or has, you know, a particular interest in these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3235.078s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, um, and as such, I would encourage anybody who isn't sure about what these questions mean, to attend or come on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3246.693s">[Lazzaro]</a>: listen and ask the questions that they would like answers to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3251.156s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would also be curious about if the school committee members who would be able to speak to the specifics of some of the school related questions might be able to participate or if they would do maybe hold their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3264.245s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure how that would, we wouldn't be able to do it at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=493.544s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I am curious if you know how long these pieces of equipment last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=631.694s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is a question generally for how we do these appropriations, is are we approving the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=640.752s">[Lazzaro]</a>: amount that they're authorized to offer, or is this the amount that it will cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=646.593s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Like, is this real numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=649.914s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This may be different for each of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=657.295s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this is based on the estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=658.635s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not like writing a check right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=660.675s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Some of this money may remain in the account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=758.558s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, I'm sorry about all these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=761.461s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Does this imply further issues like this because all the elementary schools were built at the same time and everything would presumably be failing at the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=895.733s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My main concern in asking that was about the upgrades to the electrical systems and sort of more broad-based issues that might start coming up, and if there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=904.537s">[Lazzaro]</a>: probably this is already something that's on your radar if that's something that you've been talking about just prior to piece by piece these things start to fail and then we have to go back and look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=917.656s">[Lazzaro]</a>: electrical system updates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=939.49s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If I may, I'm glad to hear that there's sort of a comprehensive plan in place that you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=946.061s">[Lazzaro]</a>: looking at and thinking about these systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=947.522s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that's encouraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=949.043s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=325.933s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is the Medford City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=333.897s">[Lazzaro]</a>: October 8th, 2024, 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=338.459s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=339.8s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=344.242s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Absolute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=345.222s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=353.066s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Sands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=356.904s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present, five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=358.805s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=360.525s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The meeting is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=362.926s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are discussing two items, which we've discussed at a previous meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=368.067s">[Lazzaro]</a>: 24-036 offered by Vice President Kit Collins, resolution to discuss an overgrowth ordinance, as well as 24-461, also offered by Vice President Collins, resolution to meet and discuss updates to the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=386.16s">[Lazzaro]</a>: These are two items that are joined together because they affect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=391.425s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And today we will be talking about the, well, I'll let Vice President Collins discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=399.653s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're going to go over the language that's been shared with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=404.959s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=667.668s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any comments from, oh, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=683.496s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=686.918s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=687.699s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any other questions or comments from councilors before I turn it over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=692.422s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=694.304s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Director O'Connor, I would love to hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=763.45s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=765.012s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do have a small question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=772.358s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do appreciate the suggestion of DCR possibly or in some professional capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=781.047s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know personally what constitutes standing water, for instance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=789.235s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is that a birdbath?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=790.556s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is that a man-made pond?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=793.017s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do like man-made water feature kind of yard situations require some level of movement of water?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=807.003s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=807.683s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That articulates my kind of lay person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=887.753s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=888.514s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=892.917s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I guess it probably when we go when we do legal review of this document, though, there'll be like a professional understanding of kind of which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=907.506s">[Lazzaro]</a>: maybe, I guess my only thought about this is that like there's a level of expertise that we don't necessarily have as a council on some of this stuff, but that somebody will and we'll be referring it to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=923.489s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Am I correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=925.369s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=938.883s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I think that would be advisable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=962.457s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=964.998s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the timeline here is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=969.281s">[Lazzaro]</a>: These documents get reviewed, then it's reviewed by legal once we approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=974.504s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry, could you say that last part again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=978.946s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Once we would approve this, it would get reviewed by legal after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1021.872s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1024.652s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I thought that the, I had no feedback besides the standing order question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1030.134s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is there, Councilor Callahan just stepped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1033.955s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other thoughts or comments by Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1042.318s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Vice President<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1167.477s">[Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1168.357s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any public participation comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1174.318s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing none in the audience, anybody on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1178.599s">[Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1179.64s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing none, I on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1185.981s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1217.508s">[Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1221.643s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The clerk just clarified that the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming, is to clarify definitions in the ordinances and then pass the ordinances on to legal for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1243.556s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We had to add a definition for standing water also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1245.938s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And to add a definition for standing water will be an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1248.339s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'll say clarify definitions also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1249.52s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Clarify definitions, yes, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1253.976s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, and once you have that written out, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1271.09s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1271.591s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Five in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1273.932s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1277.916s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins for bringing this forward and for your work on these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1282.29s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not very glamorous, but it is very necessary, and it's going to move forward in a way that is timely and useful for our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1289.793s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1292.734s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor as well for your work on this and for bringing it to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1299.557s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other motions, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1366.089s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I would favor a summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1368.91s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any other preferences?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1374.353s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It seems like a summary is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1659.403s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Director O'Connor, is there anything you'd like to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1947.7s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The current fee schedule is not, it's kind of a proposed new amount section as you're waiting on legal to help fill that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1970.803s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1973.284s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1974.665s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Can you repeat the motion for me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1978.087s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, you got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1979.307s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2014.434s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2017.898s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2021.382s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2025.926s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2030.631s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Take your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2052.806s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2053.166s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Five in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2056.467s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2059.869s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you again for this important work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2063.751s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I especially appreciate updating this with the new rules about composting and seeing all the compost bins around town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2070.272s">[Lazzaro]</a>: with their beautiful locking lids that everybody should use and love because they're great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2079.119s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have another item to discuss or another motion perhaps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2089.761s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, on Vice President Collins' motion seconded by Councilor Leming, let's say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2098.964s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2112.429s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2112.829s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Five in the affirmative, none of the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2114.33s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2115.41s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2116.15s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=820.642s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Could you go to the next steps slide again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=828.913s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the Charter Study Commission wants to release their final report soon, which is sooner than they anticipated it being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=837.719s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It had initially said December, but it's only October, which is nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=842.843s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And the mayor is hoping to review it first and then give her response?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=855.103s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I guess being that it's that they're going to come out with their response so soon, maybe I would suggest that we would see what they're thinking as compare it with what we have for a generic idea of things and kind of go from there would be my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=879.198s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They've been spending a lot of time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=881.44s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And a lot of having a lot of meetings and doing a lot of public participation, it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=888.363s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm eager to see where they've gone with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=892.605s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I know that there's a lot to take into consideration with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=901.669s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But yeah, thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=903.989s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really helpful to have it all laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1489.224s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just, is there a way that, I was just looking, trying to look through the documents just now that the committee posted and I couldn't find the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1500.989s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, it's not released.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1504.51s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But you have the motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1508.166s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I was looking at the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1510.769s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And so the committee has really put a lot of like, they voted on every, every recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1517.054s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So every single decision was a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1519.536s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it does cover a lot of ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=120.994s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2195.993s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing that I wanna mention about to answer the Zoom question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2202.814s">[Lazzaro]</a>: of residents question, Michelle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2206.659s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing that we would lose if this question, question seven in particular, does not pass, it's a very specific, I believe it's question seven, it's a very specific thing about the high school schedule, which right now does not allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2220.875s">[Lazzaro]</a>: some of the students who are taking specific classes, I believe it's in the vocational school, to take certain art classes, theater classes, visual arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2232.303s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It limits our students in being the fully well-rounded students that we want them to be able to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2239.068s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When you're in high school, you want to be able to explore<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2242.63s">[Lazzaro]</a>: figure out who you are, what you're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2244.812s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we want to give all of our students the best opportunity to be everything that they can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2249.756s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we don't want to limit them because we haven't had the opportunity to expand the schedule to really experiment with what that can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2257.722s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will also say that in 2019, I worked for the school district and I knew then that we were underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2265.027s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I started thinking about running for city council to make something like this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2268.51s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This has been happening for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2270.071s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have had underfunded<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2271.992s">[Lazzaro]</a>: schools for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2273.073s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And this has been in the works for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2274.694s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This has needed to happen for quite a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2277.435s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5917.923s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are, I would paraphrase Councilor Leming and say that we aren't all even asking for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5926.588s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are giving the voters of Medford the opportunity to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5931.724s">[Lazzaro]</a>: raise their own taxes if they would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.027s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.988s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You're allowed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5935.589s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5936.63s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're here to answer questions about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5941.457s">[Lazzaro]</a>: not to convince anybody to do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5943.358s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're just telling you what we know and what we have the luxury of knowing from having this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5950.624s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I will say is that historic underfunding has led to, and having never passed an override before, has led to such scenarios as me receiving an email that there is lead in the water at the Brooks Elementary School where my kids go because of fixtures<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5970.129s">[Lazzaro]</a>: in the building in a school that was built after the year 2000 because corners were cut because money was tried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5978.315s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They were trying to save money when they built the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5980.677s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's what happens when you don't fund your city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5984.7s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we can keep trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5987.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We can keep trying to not fund our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5990.168s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's a choice that the voters have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5992.949s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And everybody, that's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5995.251s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we all have the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5997.292s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Everybody has the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5998.872s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we're here to answer your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6000.433s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not trying to say you're good or you're bad or you're doing whatever, but I really hope, I hope that we are making decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6011.439s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They might be hard decisions, but we're making decisions that are taking care of each other, that are prioritizing the people that we care about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6021.184s">[Lazzaro]</a>: understanding the fiscal responsibility that we have towards each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7300.319s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would offer that another Councilor might be better equipped to answer the question about the way that debt exclusions are structured legally, the ramifications of how you estimate the dollar amount that it's going to cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7313.766s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I will say that the firehouse is a property of the city, which means it's owned by the residents of Medford, not the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7324.231s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So even if the union is not in agreement with the mayor, the property is owned by the city and if it's not in good working order and we need to maintain the building, it's important that the building be maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8039.024s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I used to work for the superintendent of schools, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8046.739s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've never worked for somebody who has had so much integrity and led from such a place of integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8052.302s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I believe that she, when she answered Councilor Scarpelli, who I think asked her that question a number of times over and over again, in order to try to get her to say something off or make a mistake, but she was trying to not lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8073.793s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And what she doesn't wanna do is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8076.567s">[Lazzaro]</a>: be caught up in having to make a decision that doesn't put the best scenario for the students first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8086.639s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So my guess is that that was where that was coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8092.045s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Also, that things shift in schools all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8094.608s">[Lazzaro]</a>: People leave districts for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8096.834s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If you can't reinforce or if you can't reappoint somebody to something because they got another job, these things happen all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8103.338s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can't always put somebody back in a position because they've gotten another position somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8108.521s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not always possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8110.462s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that was, I think she was trying to be truthful to the best of her ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8114.844s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The other thing I will say is I'm sorry to have hurt anybody's feelings, but I really did not appreciate getting an email saying that the fixtures inside the school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8124.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: cause there to be lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8125.926s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I am not saying it as it was somebody else's fault, but my kids go to school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8131.129s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8134.831s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10574.17s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to hear about that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10577.873s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I actually know a lot of people who have kids with learning disabilities in the schools that struggle similarly, and I know it's a big hill to overcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10591.192s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and it's a lot to grapple with and it's really frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10594.735s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I know we have a lot of work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10596.976s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I also think this is a school committee question and it's not something that we on city council grapple with very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10603.661s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I don't think that we're equipped to answer it fully, but I feel for you and it's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10614.048s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I would recommend bringing it up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10617.799s">[Lazzaro]</a>: to school committee asking if you could get something like that on the agenda or speaking to the school superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10622.981s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know it can be super, super frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10625.082s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I have friends with advocates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10626.783s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10627.603s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10628.944s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really unequitable because if you have money, you can hire somebody to either be a tutor or get an advocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10636.286s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's really horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10637.847s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a bad system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10639.448s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Literacy is so complicated and difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10641.689s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm really sorry you're going through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11255.542s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I, I, I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11257.804s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are you saying that we shouldn't be accepting English language learners into our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11265.939s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They're expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11266.76s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not going to do back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11269.402s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's not what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11270.503s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're asking questions about the overage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11271.924s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We're not talking about how English language learners are expensive for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11276.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is a public school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11278.428s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That is not something that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11279.729s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12582.958s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was me, but I was just gonna mention Councilor Leming's linkage fees, which he mentioned, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13094.83s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13323.546s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm currently serving on the committee that is working on the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13329.331s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And when the MSBA is going to ask us to request a debt exclusion for the new high school, that's gonna be significantly more expensive than what the firehouse will cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13349.486s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that we will be able to come back and ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13353.063s">[Lazzaro]</a>: for another debt exclusion for a firehouse at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13357.825s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it will take longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13359.525s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that there's a possibility that there could be an approved fire station between the two parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13368.469s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Once this debt exclusion, if it is approved, then I think the money will be available and a satisfactory firehouse can be built, or there's the opportunity for it to be built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13381.383s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think time is of the essence because of the limited nature of the timeline, given that we have an urgency of the high school coming down the pike as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13392.292s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have a lot of people in town vying for very large projects heading our direction, and I think we have to balance a lot of people's needs all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13407.964s">[Lazzaro]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=472.399s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't know Larry for very long, but I really appreciated that he, what I did know of him was that he was really fun and he was really kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=485.283s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And he was really nice to my kids when he dropped off packets at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=491.024s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And if I can be remembered that way, I would consider myself very lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=497.734s">[Lazzaro]</a>: He had my back literally and figuratively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=500.035s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was really nice having him behind me when he was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=502.997s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I had a kind of a tough time at a few meetings in the beginning of my tenure here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=508.601s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And he was very steady in presence, really, really, really nice about stuff and really kind to me and funny and cheerful and steady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=520.688s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=523.426s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I hope he and I hope he rests in peace and I hope his family finds comfort and how well loved he was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=155.796s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is Medford City Council, Public Health and Community Safety Committee, October 16th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=165.001s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We are meeting today to discuss a couple of items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=171.465s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=174.427s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=190.317s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=191.118s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Four present, one absent, meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=194.899s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We will be discussing two items today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=197.721s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The first is 22-379 offered by Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins, Resolution of Draft and Ordinance to Secure Rights to Gender Affirming Care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=211.631s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that will be actually in conjunction with 22-453, which is a former item offered by President Bears, Vice President Collins, and former Councilor Morell, resolution to discuss potential ordinances and policies to protect reproductive rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=229.745s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So these are two items that I will ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=237.509s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng to summarize for us and then we can get started discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=242.433s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have also a draft that Councilor Tseng shared with the committee today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=250.06s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=600.037s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=601.198s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I believe we still need a response from a police chief Buckley and the board of health director, Brian O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=613.688s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would be happy to reach out to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=616.277s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure if we need a motion for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=618.739s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=620.88s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I can't make that motion anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=625.143s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=625.903s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=627.504s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I was just skimming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=630.126s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure where in the language, if there is anything in the language that sort of mentions the anti-abortion clinics, or if we have the capacity to put something like that in an ordinance that would prevent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=646.254s">[Lazzaro]</a>: a facility like that from opening, or if we would be able to do something like that, but I would be curious to hear your thoughts on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=691.414s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It may be something that we want to, when we go line by line on an individual basis and then come back and talk about it, it might be worth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=699.813s">[Lazzaro]</a>: looking at, it might just be something I haven't had a chance yet to go through with a fine tooth comb, which is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=708.775s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also think it might be something that we may have to ask legal about our capacity for what we would be able to, what we can say to a business that wants to come in and what we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=725.977s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But anyway, I think this is a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=729.983s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree that sending feedback with another meeting and maybe scheduling another meeting that would be probably next month and see if we can get some more solid plans in place at that point would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=744.395s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=747.737s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other comments from, or do you have more that you want to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=764.748s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=765.088s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any further comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=769.711s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=772.413s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion Councilor Tseng mentioned was that councilors send feedback to myself and CC Councilor Tseng before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=785.641s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=788.87s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=791.511s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor, oh, we lost Councilor, oh, there they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=797.373s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'll just hold on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=806.436s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, there was traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=807.457s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=808.117s">[Lazzaro]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=832.4s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I will withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=834.861s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And so just to update the councilors that just arrived, we have been talking about the drafted language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=843.605s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do you have the language from Councilor Tseng or have you, you may not have had a chance to look it over because it was really fresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=857.61s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's some, we have some up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=891.516s">[Lazzaro]</a>: to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=893.558s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng has been going over a summary of where we're at with the ordinances about gender affirming care and reproductive health care in Medford, including non-cooperation of police if there's any outside of Massachusetts entity trying to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=917.29s">[Lazzaro]</a>: enforce laws that are not applicable in Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=921.612s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any anti-abortion clinics that may be trying to open in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=926.794s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What would be our capacity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=928.275s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We discussed what would be our capacity as a city council to attempt to prevent or enact a rule against a predatory<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=943.851s">[Lazzaro]</a>: business like that opening, and these are, we're just at a discussion stage at this point, but Councilor Tseng did distribute some language that would be the motion on the floor at the moment is from Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Leming for the members of the committee to review the language as written now, including a couple of sentences that Councilor Tseng will add in about the anti-abortion clinics<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=972.7s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that are not currently in here, but he will add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=975.563s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And if you can review the language and send thoughts or edits to myself and see what the councilors are saying before our next meeting, then we can keep moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=987.834s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But it's not, we're not at the stage yet of obviously a line by line review of the ordinance as a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=995.973s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, you may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1010.622s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1011.082s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That would be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1013.904s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1014.564s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Please do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1019.547s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1025.02s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will also reach out to the Director of the Board of Health and the Chief of Police for their feedback on the language thus far, because we haven't heard from them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1038.206s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And this is two papers that were in the past two sessions or past session that we're reviewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1051.352s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So now you're all up to speed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1053.855s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any comments from, yes, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1138.304s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1139.004s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1140.178s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1143.601s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1145.843s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1147.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1150.767s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The next item for tonight is item 24- Oh, just quickly on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1233.911s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The question was, would the committee be interested in taking up a paper on ensuring access to enshrining in an ordinance something of pharmacy compliance with maintaining access to emergency contraception?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1251.662s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1252.483s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, emergency contraception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1255.396s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Would that include like Misoprostol, Mifepristone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1259.68s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1260.821s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1261.302s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1261.702s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1262.103s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that would be like abortion pills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1263.904s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1265.306s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1265.526s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1308.41s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I see a thumbs up, which is not a spur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1312.914s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I see a thumbs up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1316.837s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It sounds like there's some interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1318.859s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I mean, I am interested in it from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1321.18s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, there's like a less of a, I don't know, I can't make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1324.283s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's a little bit more casual from the chair of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1328.947s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But yes, I mean, I would be interested in doing something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1332.27s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm curious about, I am still curious about like what our capacity is as a city to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1341.293s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What our capacity is as a city to do anything that wouldn't be already in trend in state law, but I do also think that there is value in affirming something that is right and correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1354.536s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So yeah, I would be in favor of discussing it for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1357.797s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think to that end, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1360.598s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1380.802s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think so, especially because at a local level, like we have many pharmacies in town, that would be a very localized thing to do, so that makes sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1404.916s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Would it be something that you would need to present a paper to the regular committee to then have it reviewed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1413.999s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The 22-453 resolution to discuss potential ordinances and policies to protect reproductive rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1419.861s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1420.802s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It absolutely falls under that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1426.644s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng to draft language for an ordinance to ensure pharmacy compliance with the state executive order on emergency contraception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1451.456s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1453.157s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1454.577s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1455.498s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1456.417s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1457.398s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1461.46s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are we ready to jump to the next paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1466.543s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1467.123s">[Lazzaro]</a>: 24-470, offered by Justin Tseng, City Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1470.725s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Resolution to discuss the installation of sanitary facilities in public spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1477.428s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Public Health and Community Safety Subcommittee meet to consider potential ordinances, policies, and regulations to strengthen the protection<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1486.624s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, no, that's the wrong one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1488.848s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1490.591s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1493.356s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Discuss the possibility of installing sanitary facilities and public spaces, including in our parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1498.745s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1542.813s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that one of the first things we'll have to consider is the cost and where, how to begin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1555.036s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Where do we begin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1559.285s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1564.848s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming, and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1650.71s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would suggest the Medford Family Network would be a good<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1653.57s">[Lazzaro]</a>: starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1654.691s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know they even have playgroups in the park, and they go to different parks, and probably they, Miss Andrea, I think, leads those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1666.34s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I can't remember her last name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1668.241s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I'm sure they'll have some feedback about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1672.845s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But for sure, probably Medford Family Network, Frances Nwaje, good starting points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1683.581s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Disabilities Commission, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1686.482s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins, are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1687.563s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is your hand up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1818.97s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, I would be curious to hear from, uh, Director Hunt from the planning and permitting, or planning, uh, no, that's the committee, planning department, planning sustainability department, and, um, Director McGivern from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1836.629s">[Lazzaro]</a>: DPW or DPW as well, because just of their awareness, their institutional knowledge of the city and this is deceptively a large undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1852.117s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's the sort of thing that seems like it would be simple and is actually a huge, a huge project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1856.859s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But again, I think Vice President Collins had it hit the nail on the head that it's just because something's hard or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1865.987s">[Lazzaro]</a>: feels overwhelming in the moment doesn't mean you shouldn't start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1869.47s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it still needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1873.233s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it's just a fundamental human thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1878.937s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we need to try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1881.76s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So basically we have to talk to every department head in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1886.824s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have to spend a lot of money probably, but I think it will be, I think there are ways to do it that are more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1895.023s">[Lazzaro]</a>: efficient and reasonable and if we take our time and do it right then it'll make more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1900.45s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1940.433s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is this like a cost-benefit analysis kind of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2016.832s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2079.23s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, so, as, as, so, so, Councilor Lemings motion, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2087.702s">[Lazzaro]</a>: city staff rather than specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2099.13s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2119.321s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2173.127s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is that acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2173.968s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2174.308s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2216.388s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2218.772s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2295.2s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2391.837s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2393.518s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2407.206s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2407.847s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Wilworth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2437.708s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for coming and speaking on behalf of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2440.79s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We appreciate you taking the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2445.893s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do, another thing to note is that I've observed that some parks have port-a-potties at them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2453.679s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure who pays for them, why they're there at some times of the year and other times they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2458.902s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It must be some privately funded, maybe it's an organization like Medford Youth Soccer, maybe it's the softball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2464.526s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, it's probably different times of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2467.227s">[Lazzaro]</a>: privately funded, but it's inequitable because it's at different places, and then you have access to it sometimes, and then sometimes you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2476.709s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So just something to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2481.81s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Many parts of the city are privatized right now, and if there's an opportunity for us to explore ways that we can give access to folks in the city publicly, then maybe we should explore that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2547.204s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Right, pennies on the dollar compared to what it would cost one organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2553.226s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2559.707s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2560.888s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2561.868s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other motions for this paper before... Any other motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2570.494s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Councilor, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2580.22s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion, Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2583.423s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2585.104s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2585.964s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2587.645s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=734.752s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to keep the paper in committee and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=740.336s">[Lazzaro]</a>: keep paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=893.443s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Am I, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=894.424s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yep, you're recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=895.004s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know why I'm called on with the new system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=896.465s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=898.467s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=898.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to, via email through the clerk, I had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=905.498s">[Lazzaro]</a>: mentioned something about the links being embedded for neatness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=911.865s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I was told that all the links would be embedded, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=916.73s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I have already reviewed the sections on the committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=921.295s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They look good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=922.596s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for your work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1050.672s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I like the suggested edit a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1053.113s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1139.089s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We passed Sarah Bradley Fulton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1140.93s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We tabled the commemoration of the DPW workers that will be discussed, I believe, at the next October meeting on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1152.197s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just because it was so late and we didn't want to give it short shrift, but Sarah Bradley Fulton was coming up that next weekend, so we needed to make sure it was happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1512.908s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3259.366s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One thing I can say about grants that you can apply for through the EPA and other grant making<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3267.51s">[Lazzaro]</a>: companies, opportunities, foundations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3270.052s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You can't fund a city, you can't operate a budget for a city of our size on grants alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3279.077s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It just wouldn't be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3280.417s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there are opportunities for things like that, and it is exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3284.359s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I can definitely say that Alicia Klein and other department heads are utilizing every opportunity that they come across and they are aware of these opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3296.042s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've spoken with Tim McKibben as well about a number of opportunities that they are aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3301.844s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it is something that's being utilized when it's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4071.649s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Just one thing I want to add, there's a lot of things at the city level where we have to vote as a city council to authorize funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4082.213s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mean that the money is immediately spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4084.754s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It means that we are authorizing funds to let somebody move forward with a mechanism to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4095.179s">[Lazzaro]</a>: start a project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4096.1s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mean that you're writing a check that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4098.284s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This sort of reminds me of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4100.667s">[Lazzaro]</a>: You're authorizing us to take out a bond as the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4105.615s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So as things move and change, that process continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1310.956s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, this committee meeting was to discuss a number of items that have come up over the past sessions about gender-affirming care, reproductive health, and the possibility of gender-affirming care<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1331.072s">[Lazzaro]</a>: public bathrooms in our parks in Medford and just the feasibility of all of these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1336.514s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This was a preliminary meeting for us to discuss the possibility of addressing all of these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1343.877s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we talked sort of broadly about how to begin the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1349.98s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.122s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.863s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also just wanted to reiterate that we appreciate the concerns, especially, I understand that every time I visited the Senior Center, it's an incredibly bustling place to visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2252.331s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All the activities are really well attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2256.233s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know that mobility issues can be a big concern for folks who are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2260.519s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I know that parking is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2262.582s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And my hope would be that as the city reviews the proposals that parking is always and public parking parking that's available to be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2271.333s">[Lazzaro]</a>: would still be part of the buildings that they put there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2274.757s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But Councilor Leming and I, we're members of the Resident Services Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2280.442s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And as part of that, we did a listening session at the Senior Center a few months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2285.827s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It wasn't super well attended, but it was the only only the first one we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2288.79s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we didn't have a chance to make it sort of a consistent thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2293.074s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I would be excited to do that more often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2295.737s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and have more opportunities for people to bring us what they're concerned about and tell us about the things like that, that are coming up more regularly that you're thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2304.659s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And maybe if we can make it something that perhaps rotating members of city council that can come to the senior center and hear concerns from people, we can look into that in resident services and talk more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6314.721s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6315.462s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, when we talk about increasing property taxes and our prep two and a half override questions we also discuss new growth frequently because that's another mechanism for increasing revenue to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6331.182s">[Lazzaro]</a>: this will be a wonderful opportunity to increase revenue coming into Medford without asking our residents to pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6342.628s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That will contribute to the services that we can provide our residents, and this is the way we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6348.531s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm so grateful to Vice President Collins and the rest of the Planning and Permitting Committee for all of their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6355.194s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6356.121s">[Lazzaro]</a>: watching the meetings lately, and it's just taken a ton of commitment and a lot of very careful, thoughtful planning and design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6366.983s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and a lot of great collaboration with Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6370.627s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm looking forward to seeing where we go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6374.571s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But this is new growth on Mystic Ebb has the potential to pay for things like keeping the library open on Sundays, like smaller projects that we couldn't possibly justify with larger things like an override because they're, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6389.861s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that we can't afford to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6391.743s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um uh, things that are too too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6392.764s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There are too many things we need to pay for that we can't afford yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6395.527s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And the way that we bring in that revenue without asking our residents to scrimp and save and give us more is by giving our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6409.621s">[Lazzaro]</a>: we want to be able to provide the services that our residents need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6413.745s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also did just want to address briefly that I know that our City Hall employees are attempting in many ways to address a lot of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6425.558s">[Lazzaro]</a>: public feedback that they do need for things like car park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6430.441s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I work out in car park a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6432.422s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't live near car park, but a lot of my friends do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6435.404s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I was approached by a city hall employee in car park when I was exercising once to ask me to weigh in on phase two of car park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6445.011s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What do I need to see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6445.911s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I did an online form that I was given, like, what do you want in car park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6450.634s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there were, there was, I experienced some outreach about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6455.512s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's hard to reach everybody, but I think that there are a lot of avenues that City Hall employees in the planning department are attempting to achieve and we appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6467.636s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I know it can be tough, but it's, they're doing it, they're trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6471.917s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1456.058s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Callahan bringing this forward with the intention of following your genuine hopes to put forward something that would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1473.288s">[Lazzaro]</a>: What the original suggestion here was, was that council would vote for a cola increase, which is a cost of living increase for a future if they wanted to for a future city council not for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1487.676s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It wouldn't take effect until the next two years, if it if it ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1491.838s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That is what she intended, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1494.079s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1495.66s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Meaning you could never and that is true for some other cities, but it's part of their charters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1501.703s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this this wouldn't be something that we can put in as an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1505.505s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My understanding is you would have to do it as a charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1507.146s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that's why it would be referred to governance, we could talk about it in the governance committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1510.247s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's where we talk about charter changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1512.956s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think we need to discuss it in a regular meeting, we could talk about it in governance, and I think that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1519.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that voting publicly for cost of living increases for ourselves that people can witness and if they can, if they are upset about that and I think a 2% increase for a body that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1533.078s">[Lazzaro]</a>: makes currently $29,000 a year, 30,000 maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1536.9s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If you want to vote us out because of that increase, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1539.361s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's your right as voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1540.842s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1541.763s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we're doing it transparently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1543.003s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We've decided to do it and you can vote us out if you don't like that we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1547.306s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Because that's a democratic choice that you can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1550.267s">[Lazzaro]</a>: All of that being said, I think it's bad faith to see what was written and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1560.58s">[Lazzaro]</a>: argue that Councilor Callahan was trying to say, we will like across the board, give ourselves insane increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1570.626s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that that is what this discussion is about tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1572.647s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that's what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1573.708s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think we know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1575.149s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know that, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1577.07s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I, if we haven't, if we don't have a second on moving us to governance, then I would second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1581.953s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I think that we should move it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=914.764s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=915.705s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I just had a question about capacity in your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=918.81s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is there is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=921.754s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=923.677s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Will it require you to take on more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=925.82s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=928.872s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Since it's contracting out with housing families, which I've worked with them before too, they're really wonderful, Laura's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=935.221s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If they're handling this and it's their space in your budget for them to do the work, then maybe this is a moot point, but is there anything that you're going to have to be taking on that's going to be more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=945.902s">[Lazzaro]</a>: complicated or difficult or is it good totally well within your capacity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1052.542s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Chair, if I may, just two thoughts I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1058.285s">[Lazzaro]</a>: One is that I just know that capacity can be limited in our city hall offices in Medford, so just something I'd love to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1069.625s">[Lazzaro]</a>: keep in mind for for us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1072.67s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's really important that we take advantage of programs like this they're really wonderful and it's a great way for us to reach out to folks who can benefit from our from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1083.96s">[Lazzaro]</a>: programs that are available like this, but we should not be stretching our steps so thin that, you know, they can't operate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1091.022s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that just means hiring and building our capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1095.783s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The second thing is, is there something built in for outreach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1099.283s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's possible that I've missed it, but just letting people know about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1102.664s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Is there a plan for letting qualified folks know about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1997.751s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I do like the idea of tying it to the fee schedule, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2015.5s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2231.154s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There are just a couple of, this may just be a holdover, but the Administration Finance Committee, Governance Committee just have like blank, a couple of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2280.999s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When we're ready, I'm happy to motion to move this to the regular committee or no, we don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2302.296s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Approve a contingent upon what is voted on in the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2357.384s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2357.945s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We I've been communicating with Pamela Kelly of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2366.105s">[Lazzaro]</a>: senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2367.686s">[Lazzaro]</a>: She has a title, elder services, director of elder services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2375.409s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we set up a time, consistent time to hold a listening session at the senior center in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2382.972s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm going to host that the first time, but we'll have a rotating, hopefully other Councilors can rotate in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2389.514s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and we'll have it be a consistent, ongoing session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2393.616s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's gonna be Thursdays at noon once a month, starting in January at the end of January, January 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2400.14s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that should be a great opportunity to hear from our local seniors and make sure that folks are used to seeing city council members there at the senior center available to hear concerns and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2418.786s">[Lazzaro]</a>: bring those concerns back to our committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2420.788s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, as as we're able and looking forward to getting started with that, and we're gonna be able to put it in the senior center newsletter, so people will be aware of it leading up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2622.017s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will be with Councilor Callahan at the library on Saturday for the Arab American liaison listening session, but I can't be there on the 7th of December so I but I would also be fine with like seating that to another Councilor if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2639.853s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I could do the 4th, January 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2641.794s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, it's kind of like these sessions aren't meant to be too many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2646.497s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Honestly, if there were three of us, there would be a quorum of this committee and we wouldn't be able to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2650.519s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that's sort of the conundrum, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2654.421s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I would say probably December 7th would work for the West Medford Community Center if you wanted to do that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2662.165s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2663.166s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Makes sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2892.111s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that the library, though I mean we're already doing some targeted sessions at the library but it being a space that people with young kids before they go to school, meet frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2907.869s">[Lazzaro]</a>: people, low income folks who don't have somewhere to hang out during the day will frequently go, especially when it's cold out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2916.516s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It tends to be a gathering space for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2919.458s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Lots of different groups in the community can be, if we had capacity similar to what we're doing at the senior center, to go consistently to the library in one of the rooms and we could advertise on a regular basis, that might be something that we could do similar to what we're doing at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2000.876s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to echo what Vice President Collins was saying about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2006.331s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thanking director Blake for his work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2010.374s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I, the more blue bikes we are getting into the city, the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2013.917s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just would encourage this council to continue to look at how we can increase the safety of biking infrastructure in the city as we, as we go into these kinds of processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5292.857s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If I can just briefly give you a moment of context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5295.378s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When I lived in Somerville, I rented and it was getting very expensive to rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5302.922s">[Lazzaro]</a>: My husband worked for a tech company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5304.743s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We sold stock to pay the down payment on a condo in Somerville because there was a residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5312.627s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When we were paying our mortgage, we paid less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5315.253s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So when we were homeowners, because we had stock to sell, because we had enough money to buy property, we were able to pay less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5324.638s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sometimes residential exemption is what amounts to a handout to people with enough money to buy property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5333.482s">[Lazzaro]</a>: To put that into perspective, sometimes that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5338.564s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's what it was for me when I lived in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5344.119s">[Lazzaro]</a>: In this case, I think in Medford, the break even does not make sense at this point today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5351.025s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I feel that our conversation about it is losing some of the context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5362.514s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When our residents voted for the override,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5366.886s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They were not voting to then turn around and exempt themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5370.707s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They voted to increase the property tax rate as they expected it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5377.57s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's what we're voting to enact tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5382.592s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1212.093s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, that was a very fun Thanksgiving game in the rain, and it was cold, and it was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1218.534s">[Lazzaro]</a>: They played, the team played so, so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1220.395s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1223.315s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm so happy to celebrate the team and gladly support that resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1230.776s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for putting it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1860.389s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1861.27s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think you can tell how much the City Council relishes an opportunity to talk about our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1868.474s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We don't get that many chances, but it's exciting when we have something to celebrate like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1873.977s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I do really agree and want to reiterate how important it is for students in our public schools to have opportunities to try different things, find the thing that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1886.944s">[Lazzaro]</a>: they fit in with and that they can thrive in, whatever that thing is, if it's sports, if it's music, if it's art, if it's some seemingly random or counterintuitive activity that makes them really happy and makes them feel like they have a place, that's what makes kids thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1906.674s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the importance of these kinds of successes for our students can't be overstated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1913.537s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm just very excited about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1915.959s">[Lazzaro]</a>: these resolutions coming forward and these celebrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1919.026s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2101.927s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I found the records in order and I move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2626.573s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would just have some basic questions about if there are any changes planned to the building or the establishment, or if it's just a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2637.556s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, just a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2639.376s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2982.947s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2984.388s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is an issue that was brought to my attention by some local concerned citizens who, in particular, we were talking about Route 16 close to the Whole Foods where the guardrail has been crashed into and replaced so many times that it has its own Instagram account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3008.89s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, it's, uh, it's while we were walking through that intersection, we witnessed at least two, at least two extremely illegal and dangerous traffic violations that we pointed to, and we were like, like that, like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3026.156s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It just kept happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3027.757s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, people drive really fast on Route 16 in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3030.718s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and then, uh, as I was looking into it, I discovered what the other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3037.18s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that are controlled by state agencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3041.403s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This causes a lot of complications when we try to increase the safety of our roadways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3047.907s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3050.068s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to make a couple of notes on this resolution after looking into it and discussing the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3056.852s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um a couple of these roadways are now under local<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3066.898s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we can if we can amend that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3071.04s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Or I'm not sure if we need to amend it really the the mass general law chapter 90 section 18 says that we can basically petition those agencies to change their sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3082.565s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So really, all we're doing is we're saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3085.606s">[Lazzaro]</a>: DCR, can you lower the speed limit of the roads that you control, mainly route 16 and 38 and 28, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3102.205s">[Lazzaro]</a>: are up around 35 miles per hour is the limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3105.206s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And people do drive faster than that, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3107.927s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But it's just like anything, we're not in charge of how people break the laws, we're only in charge of what the laws are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3112.428s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So if we would like to move forward with it, we would say, we would ask these state agencies to change their, those roadways speed limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3123.792s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And what that does is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3128.527s">[Lazzaro]</a>: lessens the likelihood that a crash would be a fatal crash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3133.432s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that is the hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3135.834s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It is a small step, but it is hopefully something in the direction of greater safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3141.399s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I wanted to say thank you to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3145.543s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Walk Medford, Ellery Klein of Walk Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3147.944s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We had a ton of support from the Medford Bike Commission, Emily O'Brien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3154.728s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We had support from Patricia, Senator Patricia Jalen's office, Matt Hartman, her chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3160.831s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We had a big group of people that did this walking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3163.692s">[Lazzaro]</a>: of that intersection, but we talked a lot about there are a lot of really interested people and, um, traffic safety and just safety of human beings moving through the city is, of course, not I don't think it's very contentious issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3176.319s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um so people do want to be safe where they live and work and travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3180.921s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this is a this is something that I think can At least move in the direction of achieving that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3188.545s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3218.28s">[Lazzaro]</a>: sorry, what I do wonder is if we would, if it would behoove us to ever take anything out of it, like we might as well just say anything that's state controlled, ask that the agency is lower the speed limit to 25 miles per hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3233.844s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3259.34s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3260.34s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Rather than eliminating some that are technically city-controlled, to maybe just say any and all state-controlled roads, we petition that they be lowered to 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1106.635s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to echo what President Bears was saying, and I'm really excited about getting started and looking forward to taking what the committee discussed and what the Collins Center has to report and moving forward and getting going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1122.382s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is really exciting work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1123.482s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is something that we've been talking about for a long time and what many of us talked about during our campaigns as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1129.084s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So this is very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1131.265s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm excited to get going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2241.001s">[Lazzaro]</a>: For the sake of clarity, also, it seems to me that the more we can be, the more our body and our state delegation can be on the same page and in agreement with each other, the better<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2255.686s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The better position we would be probably to move it along quicker at the state level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2262.522s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2263.164s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to be super clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=808.404s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=809.765s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng and Councilor Leming for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=814.549s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm very eager to work on this ordinance and I think there are a lot of situations that can make our residents in Medford nervous about things happening at the federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=833.564s">[Lazzaro]</a>: even some things that are happening at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=835.645s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So when there are things that we can do at the local level to ensure the safety of our residents, I think we should absolutely take those steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=843.887s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And this is a great example of how we can do that in a way that may feel small, but to many people, I think it's not a small thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=855.55s">[Lazzaro]</a>: some experience with family members who have live in different states and have had experiences where they've been trying to access medical care and have had experiences where ice has been called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=868.852s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This isn't in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=870.793s">[Lazzaro]</a>: This is in Texas, and it's a very real situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=875.654s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The more that we can do to ensure our residents that they are not going to be subject to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=886.637s">[Lazzaro]</a>: that sort of danger when trying to access medical care, I think is really critical and our residents deserve that kind of assurance that they are safe in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=901.747s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you and I'm excited to get working on the specifics of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2570.201s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate all the comments we've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2572.763s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I have an incredibly prosaic note that there is a typo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2578.628s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Section 5083F employees is misspelled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2583.892s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just noticed when I was reading through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2586.855s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Whistleblower protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2588.196s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's just an extra A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2592.778s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I did also have some thoughts about the reporting requirements for the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2597.381s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm just curious about how easy or difficult that might be for the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2606.968s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If it's a non-participation, non-compliance, then it may be unnecessary to report out what they're not doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2617.635s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm curious about how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2619.471s">[Lazzaro]</a>: how that works, or if we can maybe, I'd be curious to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2626.995s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2628.415s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's whistleblower protection subject to the blah, blah, blah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2630.717s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's the second line down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2631.837s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It says any city employees with an AS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2634.639s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do you see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2639.901s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Defined in section 185.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2640.682s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2683.186s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, maybe Councilor Tseng even did you draft it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2685.768s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2686.108s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2689.971s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, especially because just because it says every six months and especially if it's ah, I'm just I am curious about how we would have how their department would have records if it's something that's non participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2767.975s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2769.616s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The only reason I, I would just, I thought it was a very,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2778.483s">[Lazzaro]</a>: the last speaker made about how when our police department is focusing on things that are not, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2786.525s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Helping our residents, then it's taking time and energy away from helping our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2790.386s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So and I wouldn't want to ask our police department to be doing things that's outside of the realm of their responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2797.748s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That being said, I do realize like and we'll be talking about this tomorrow because we're making some edits to the C cups ordinance and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2804.21s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But that reporting requirement is already, you know, something that's happening in that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2811.155s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And often it's like the report is there is no update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2815.838s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's fine, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2817.439s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So it's not, you know, a ridiculous ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2820.862s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure we weren't, you know, without realizing it, putting too much on the plates of different departments in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3648.721s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would say that when it seems like something is changing hands, but staying pretty much the same, it seems less interesting to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3661.951s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But when it's something that's like changing over, like, I mean, I was a huge Chili Garden fan, love Chili Garden, very sad that they are changing hands, but interested to see what Buns House turns out to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3673.921s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3676.142s">[Lazzaro]</a>: people are very interested in the businesses that open up in Medford because it changes the kind of cultural landscape of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3681.906s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I do think that we should be kind of exploring, I think that's a way that the work of city council really translates directly into people's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3690.571s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I think we should be like, I think we should be including that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3695.414s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When it Yeah, but I think you're right, like case by case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3698.335s">[Lazzaro]</a>: In this case, I think we should include it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3901.329s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3901.79s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4062.808s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=452.914s">[Lazzaro]</a>: this is a meeting of the Medford City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=458.496s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, we are meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=463.817s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, December 11th 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=468.438s">[Lazzaro]</a>: To discuss the some edits to the, um C Cops ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=478.401s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, clerk, can you please call the role?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=491.249s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=491.97s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=493.79s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=494.851s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will hand it over to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=502.174s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=743.295s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins, would you like to share the portion of the proposed amendments on Zoom or on the screen so that we can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=754.507s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=755.648s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Hang on one sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=800.191s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It is also on the website under today's, on today's agenda as part of our packet for tonight, the full ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=990.852s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1054.608s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, I'm getting used to the mic system still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1057.67s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1127.327s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Similarly, I would assume the whole ordinance would have been run by Council prior to passage previously and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1139.528s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess this is a question for Vice President Collins as well, that when that came up, that probably was addressed, or is the assumption that ordinances written by City Council are only applicable to matters that are addressed by our police department, our, you know, city services, our, you know, municipal, only in the realm of municipal services?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1167.105s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But, you know, in thinking about this, you think about like our tree ordinance, which does have something to do with private property, to some degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1172.751s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, I guess, like, how explicit are we trying to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1233.837s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1360.515s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins, can you repeat that one more time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1362.616s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So the clerk has, this is an amendment to the language of the first proposed addition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1371.553s">[Lazzaro]</a>: her legal counsel, and what was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1381.277s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Can you say it one more time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1425.25s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1426.07s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, that covers the first section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1429.111s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1434.253s">[Lazzaro]</a>: About the proposed addition to Section 50 79.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1439.055s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Enforcement remedies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1440.175s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Penalties whistleblower protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1444.416s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1447.403s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think we should talk about the second section before we talk before we hear from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1452.325s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, yeah, uh, proposed amendments section 50 80 certain public private transactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1459.509s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Prohibited Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1707.162s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1708.183s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Any other councilor comments on this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1715.229s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1838.41s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1840.992s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1959.749s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2050.316s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2051.536s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's a very valid point and something that we should consider including.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2063.919s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other any further comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2070.143s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Shall we move to public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2073.825s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, do we have any public comment in the chambers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2670.456s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2672.317s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing no further public participation, are there any motions on the floor, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2736.742s">[Lazzaro]</a>: On Vice President Collins' various motions, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2760.631s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming, do you have a separate motion to make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2873.527s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2874.127s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Five in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2876.128s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2880.129s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2881.47s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2886.359s">[Lazzaro]</a>: on the motion of Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Leming to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2893.545s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you call the roll, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2895.987s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When you have a chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2911.44s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=761.948s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=811.958s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I nominate Councilor Kit Collins for vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=357.955s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1665.111s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1665.591s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to note that this is something that's come up in my discussion with residents lately a lot, especially about what happens to be the neighborhood that I live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1675.378s">[Lazzaro]</a>: West Manfred Square has a lot of empty storefronts, and it's just been a common discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1683.263s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'd love to help support any conversations you're having, Councilor Leming, if it's helpful at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1689.547s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So if you need a backup on this, I'd be happy to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1974.8s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1975.341s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1976.061s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to, um I know you were you're trying to move forward, but paid family medical leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1982.746s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think I missed what you said about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1984.788s">[Lazzaro]</a>: If anything, is there any possibility of that moving?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1988.39s">[Lazzaro]</a>: this year, do you think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2031.776s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3298.183s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3298.723s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just also want it similarly to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3301.546s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's reminding me of some of the things I've been discussing with some residents and other lawmakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3308.653s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I've been meeting with, we passed recently the asking DCR and MassDOT to lower the speed limit in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3322.329s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that was never in a committee so I wonder where in the governing agenda, we would put something like that like accomplishments from other that never needed to go to committee ended up being something that we just passed in regular session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3334.638s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But it does kind of fall under the one of the things that Councilor Collins mentioned about like bike safety made me think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3342.817s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I just had a meeting today that would be sort of like an ongoing discussion of like how to implement, what are the other areas?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3350.26s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Somebody had an accident recently, we were sort of talking about like how best to address some of those issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3355.102s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm curious about like, you know, where do we put things that aren't actually like, they're not a paper number, but they're ongoing issues that are like discussions with DCR about how to implement traffic mitigation measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3446.653s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I guess the question would only come up for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3449.574s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's not as important a thing if it's something that's so simple that it's done right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3455.136s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But in this case, I think it's traffic mitigation that's going to be a continual project, especially with conversations that we have to have in an ongoing manner with DCR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3469.662s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And something that came up today was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3476.883s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I guess this would be a paper I would introduce in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3478.984s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So maybe this is something that's a new discussion, but how to support state-level goals to do with traffic cameras that might be introduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3491.868s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But that's something that would be state-level, and we would be maybe just a support player.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3496.31s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But since it's something that was passed at our level but does require follow-up, I guess that's the, that's like, where would that live?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3765.08s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3765.7s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we are at Public Health and Community Safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3770.041s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We met a fair amount this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3774.482s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I will start at the major projects that we only met one time to talk about the warm air and cooling center, just an overview that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3784.074s">[Lazzaro]</a>: is a project that has kind of been backburnered, not because of lack of interest, but because of cost and more emergent issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3799.957s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's also alternative emergency responsibility and oversight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3803.698s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's something that we can definitely discuss going forward, as well as One Stop Center for Public Services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3809.059s">[Lazzaro]</a>: These are things that were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3810.54s">[Lazzaro]</a>: offered before I came in to lead this committee, but I'm happy to address them as they're presented, yet the One-Stop Center hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3820.874s">[Lazzaro]</a>: hasn't been assigned a paper number, but the things that we did talk about this year was 24021 was plant medicine decriminalization resolution that was in support of something that was at the state level, which we did pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3836.863s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There's the overgrowth ordinance, which we are in process of working on, and updates to the rodent control ordinance, which is new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3845.428s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's something we have also been working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3848.107s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, we were meeting closely with the director of the board of health, um, talking about how this is all of these ordinances kind of work together to, um, mitigate, uh, complications with, um, things that happen in the city that end up contributing to rodent issues that if we address them all in conjunction, it can, um, mitigate those problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3870.663s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So, uh, these things come from the board of health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3874.326s">[Lazzaro]</a>: and then they come to us and we can implement those suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3879.81s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We did the wildlife feeding ordinance that was a lot of meetings, and it resulted in an ordinance that is now on the books, which is great and exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3892.257s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And there's some other stuff that we haven't taken up yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3895.219s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Regulating retail sales of animals, that hasn't been taken up yet, but I'd be happy to do that when it comes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3901.86s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We have recently had a meeting about gender affirming care and reproductive health care protection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3906.222s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to take this up again soon because it's one of these kind of emergent things similar to CCOPS, which we, I mean, I'll get to that in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3917.186s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Actually, it's not even on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3919.368s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think probably because we should probably add it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3923.592s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But the civilian, what does it stand for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3930.477s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3930.737s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Community control over public surveillance ordinance was established and already part of our ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3941.505s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But we were closing a couple of loopholes and making it even stronger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3948.884s">[Lazzaro]</a>: in response to requests from our community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3953.687s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that was something that just came up very recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3957.769s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And we completed it just last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3961.091s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But, you know, that was something that was already complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3965.814s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I think it wouldn't have even occurred to us that we would come back into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3970.016s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But, you know, these things kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3972.048s">[Lazzaro]</a>: come from the community, we respond to their requests, and we make it happen as people speak to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3979.192s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And it becomes clear that it's something the community wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3981.654s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3983.274s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So that's something that just came about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3986.616s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And I think the Gender Affirming Care and Reproductive Health Care Protection Ordinance will be another thing like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3991.499s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And that's something I'm eager to take up early in 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3998.448s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, another thing is an ongoing thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4000.349s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Surveillance ordinance reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4001.549s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's that's the C cups ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4003.069s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's a regular reporting requirement of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4005.57s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We had 11 instance of Chief Buckley coming in doing a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4010.952s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I believe that happens again next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4013.933s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Um, housing stability, notification ordinance implementation and enforcement is, um and emergency response equipment replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4023.296s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's a future thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4025.756s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But this is something that we review annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4028.863s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So yeah, I think I'm in lieu of taking too much more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4032.645s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I know we had a very long meeting yesterday, but I think I will just stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4038.408s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I'm very eager to continue with the work of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4043.151s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's been fruitful and useful, and I'm excited to keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4095.662s">[Lazzaro]</a>: A worse job for the rest of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4101.802s">[Lazzaro]</a>: vote again voted out by rats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1345.127s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, at this committee meeting, we discussed edits to the CCOPS ordinance, which will also be presented at tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2868.456s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, thank you for your presentation, I think we can also probably watch the school committee meeting from yesterday in between now and when we have our committee of the whole and review that presentation as well which could be really beneficial to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2880.883s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I feel comfortable voting yes for this I also think that when you mentioned the gremlins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2885.302s">[Lazzaro]</a>: There may have been, I'm not sure if this happened, but there may have been some measures taken in the prior projects being done that we could avoid this time around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2897.969s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Hopefully we won't have gremlins in this project and we can have just a really solid foundation with this HVAC system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2906.354s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would hope we could avoid that this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2909.516s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you, I appreciate you coming here and presenting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2913.518s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8170.68s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8174.881s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The only reason I will vote no on this first issue is because it's a school committee issue and because of the separation of powers in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8185.744s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Not because it's not interesting, not because it doesn't, it may not have a budgetary impact on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8191.586s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We will see the budgetary impact when it is pertinent to our body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8197.724s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's it's it's like the main job of school committee is to oversee hire non-renew, rehire, start a search committee, this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8208.293s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That is what school committee does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8209.414s">[Lazzaro]</a>: That's not what City Council does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8211.016s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9219.773s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, can you just repeat what the amended for me, what the amended motion was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9739.866s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9741.187s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9743.429s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I would also say if it would make sense, we could hold it in the public health and community safety committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9749.313s">[Lazzaro]</a>: And then if we could leave the committee to executive session, I don't know if that's common, but that way we would avoid any open meeting on violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9756.179s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know if that's, if this meeting would be in open, in an open session or not, but the, it seems to me as a community, as a public safety,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9767.688s">[Lazzaro]</a>: organization, the fire department, we could do it in committee if that makes more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13156.746s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13157.106s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to clarify one thing that this is something that is already in practice for the Medford Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13163.432s">[Lazzaro]</a>: We discussed this in our committee meeting at length, but I did want to say for folks gathered here today that may not have been at the committee meeting that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13174.989s">[Lazzaro]</a>: When we put something like this in an ordinance, it's much more difficult if something were to change down the road to, you know, change a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13186.872s">[Lazzaro]</a>: is something you can do kind of quickly to change an ordinance, it would be much more complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13190.714s">[Lazzaro]</a>: So we're enshrining something that is practiced now in our city ordinances so that it's something that we are affirming and saying that it is something that we believe in very firmly, that this is something that is part of our local laws and it will be hard to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13212.486s">[Lazzaro]</a>: turn around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13214.328s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It's something that I think is very important, and I think it's important that we're doing it tonight, and I appreciate all the work that's gone into it thus far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13220.773s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20760.771s">[Lazzaro]</a>: I think that would have been a great idea for one of the many planning and permitting committee meetings that we've had already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20767.077s">[Lazzaro]</a>: But I mean, well, it was never a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20769.479s">[Lazzaro]</a>: It was never proposed as a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20775.324s">[Lazzaro]</a>: The Community Development Board is not this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=830.761s">[Lazzaro]</a>: Present<br><br>
