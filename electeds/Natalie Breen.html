 <p>[Natalie Breen]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=808.149s">Hi,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=810.811s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=812.672s">My</a> name's Natalie Breen, and I am running for Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=816.154s">I'm</a> 24 years old, a lifelong Medford resident, and a very proud graduate of Medford Public Schools, having attended the Forest Park, the Andrews, the McGlynn, and Medford High class of 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=826.96s">I</a> graduated from Suffolk University in 2013 with a degree in marketing, and I now work in commercial real estate and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=835.768s">I</a> am also an appointed member of Medford's Commission for Persons with Disabilities, making sure the city is accessible for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=843.995s">And</a> I am also a first-time candidate for public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=847.476s">My</a> brother, Patrick, is a bagger at Stop and Shop and a graduate of Medford Public Schools as well, as well as volunteering at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=856.543s">My</a> mom, Karen Breen, has been a nurse for the Medford public school system for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=861.927s">And</a> my father is on the board for the Riverside Yacht Club here in Medford, as well as a former Medford youth girls softball coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=869.153s">I</a> can assure you I would be a much better city Councilor than I was a softball player. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=873.136s">I</a> was very, very bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=874.217s">My</a> dad actually had to make a position for me so I could play. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=877.619s">But</a> that's a little bit about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=879.9s">So</a> why am I running? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=881.781s">It's</a> pretty simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=882.761s">I</a> love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=883.721s">I</a> love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=884.562s">I</a> grew up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=885.422s">I</a> plan to stay here for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=887.443s">I</a> would love to raise a family here. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=888.883s">I'm</a> very personally invested in bringing Medford to the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=893.685s">I</a> want Medford to be the best it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=895.645s">I'm</a> a firm believer that you can't be what you can't see, and I think we really need a young female voice on the council to speak for people in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=903.835s">I</a> think I can bring a lot of energy and new ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=907.096s">And</a> I grew up surrounded by people who have dedicated their lives to public service and helping others. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=912.799s">My</a> uncles are firefighters, my mother's a nurse, and I just feel this is my way to contribute back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=919.602s">And</a> while I have no past political experience, this is actually a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=923.844s">It</a> means I have no notion of how things have to be done or things have to be done a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=927.885s">I</a> can think outside the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=929.786s">I</a> offer a fresh new perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=932.418s">What's</a> great about Medford is we have all the resources to bring Medford to the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=936.841s">Everything's</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=938.282s">We</a> just need people to roll up their sleeves and make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=941.725s">And</a> when I say resources, what I'm referring to is the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=945.147s">It's</a> flowing through our downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=946.468s">We're</a> not making use of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=948.39s">We</a> have access to Boston by bus, train, car. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=951.392s">We're</a> so close to one of the most vibrant cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=953.633s">We</a> have one of the biggest national educational institutions in Tufts right here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=959.04s">We</a> could use them a lot more, create a stronger partnership with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=963.123s">We</a> have the Fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=964.024s">We</a> have countless historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=965.845s">We</a> have the Chevalier Theater, which I think is going to bring a lot of energy to the square, which desperately needs it, as well as the Brooks Estates, which is a passion project of mine and I think could be a really great revenue generator for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=979.643s">So</a> everything's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=980.784s">We</a> just really need to put it together and make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=984.085s">But</a> areas that are at the top of my priority list, based on what I've talked to people about walking around the city, is one, our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=992.388s">I</a> think that's the bare basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=993.849s">I've</a> heard a lot about roads, about sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=995.95s">I</a> think everybody can agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=998.01s">So</a> we definitely need to start there, making sure our roads are safe and accessible for pedestrians, cyclists, vehicle traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1005.672s">in</a> making sure we are improving and maintaining our streets on a regular and reliable schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1010.694s">It</a> means when a contractor comes in to do work for the city, we're making sure they leave the street better than when they found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1017.052s">Next,</a> public safety, so our police officers and our firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1021.253s">They're</a> understaffed, which will become more of a problem as Medford continues to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1025.974s">I'm</a> sure everyone's aware of how much development is going on and how many people will be coming into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1031.795s">They</a> lack resources, and they're working in subpar conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1035.216s">I</a> can say as a female, what the female officers have at the Medford Police Station is an atrocity to me, and I think it needs to be fixed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1043.52s">We</a> need to stand up for people who put their lives on the line every day for us, for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1047.364s">And</a> we cannot cut corners when it comes to public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1051.328s">It's</a> a must. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1051.909s">There's</a> no questions about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1053.921s">Also</a> community access, so making sure the city government is accessible and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1059.123s">A</a> lot of feedback I got when walking around the city is that people didn't know about something until it was already happening or maybe after it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1065.905s">And</a> while we all love our Barry calls, I think we could do a lot more in terms of communicating with the residents and the constituents of the city and making sure that departments are collaborating with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1076.709s">I</a> think there's a lot of untapped potential there if we joined forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1081.604s">Also</a> a charter review so our charter has not been reviewed in 30 years I think any document that has been around for 30 years is well worth taking a look at regardless of 20 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1092.89s">Yep</a> and Development so making sure we are thinking of develop development responsibly So these are some things I plan to bring to City Council and ideas that I have and I hope that on November 7th You guys come out and cast one of your seven votes for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1107.617s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1107.957s">I</a>
