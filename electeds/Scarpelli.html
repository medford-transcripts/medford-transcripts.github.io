    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=21.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=467.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1037.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1039.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1352.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1358.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1359.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1373.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1374.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the 200 feet that we were told that Winthrop street will now have sidewalk throughout the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1381.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's national grid is going to take care of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1383.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a national grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1384.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was ever source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1386.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was already set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1387.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1389.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll be, that'll be part of next week's meeting too, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1392.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can see this part of the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1394.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was in the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1395.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1396.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1396.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1397.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1400.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1580.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, for one, I know that this council has worked very hard with making sure that our, uh, our natural grid never source and other utilities do what they need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1592.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1594.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will be the first time I'll see that, that announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1596.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is something that we'll, we'll get on as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1600.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming out tonight and, uh, and sharing your opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1604.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1606.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we have a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1608.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have any other, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1609.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1610.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How's it going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1927.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1929.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think this is, we just had a Committee of the Whole meeting with the project being done with Eversource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1936.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things we talked about is, as we move forward with that before we approve it, is having more of community input and making sure we have community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1944.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this disheartening that this has happened again to this neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1948.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I know that you have champions behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1951.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to make sure that we can do what we can right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1954.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, Mr. Vice president, if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2149.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2149.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the motion, Vice President Mast, that we amend the paper that be forwarded, the mitigation, the Traffic Plan, and the Clerk of the Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2163.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighbor communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2164.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the four pieces I believe that we need to send to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2169.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2171.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2171.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So second, uh, Councilor Knight, all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2176.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2177.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2359.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2361.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember the resolution is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2363.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Consumers appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2365.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to, on the motion, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo that this go to subcommittee on economics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2373.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Business and economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2374.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Business and economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2376.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2379.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2451.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2452.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe at the end of the meeting, Mr. Cassin, if you could give us the name of that company that we can actually, not publicly, but ask the weights and measures director, Mr. Champoli, to look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2463.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what his job is, to make sure those ones<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2473.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Leave a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2505.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They also do the oil trucks and all our cabs too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2508.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2510.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On that, on that motion seconded by council dollar Russo to, uh, move this paper to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2517.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On economic development, all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2519.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2520.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2521.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2522.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can go to unfinished business, uh, 17-571, um, to dispose of its common vehicular license, City Bazaar, 466 Main Street, City Council since July 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2538.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's been tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2539.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, they're not coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2541.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have the motion to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2546.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2548.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, on the motion to be seconded by Councilor Knight, all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2608.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took them from Councilor Marksley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2610.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Records were stolen by Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2612.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were tabled records of meeting October 17th were passed to Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2617.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mungo Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2618.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2619.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Records of the meeting, October 31st, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2621.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll pass to vice president marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2624.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do you find those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2628.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2629.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the motion table, those records all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2632.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Opposed guys have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=618.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=619.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Billy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=620.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=622.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, Councilor Markswell, reiterating what, I don't want to be redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=628.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You brought up the same points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=630.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that in today's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=637.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Studies have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=641.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=649.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're limiting them from using public transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=652.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I second the resolve from Council Marks and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=658.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can, and if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=685.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: information back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=692.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=696.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=701.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to put a picnic bench out there, it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=708.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, uh, what goes on in that area and a negative note when, um, when there is, when they, when they are waiting in between buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=722.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I second the resolve from, uh, council marks and, um, amended, uh, well, to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=736.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an answer back within two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1394.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1396.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1397.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1398.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, my colleague, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1400.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that months and months and months ago when we first were presented, I was one of the councils that voted against it because of the lack of information that went out to our constituencies, to our community, and with the opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1418.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in discussions with neighbors, where neighbors that have been very conscious about purchasing their own energy and they're valid in understanding what the situation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1432.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I did my homework in visiting a few communities, one of the biggest pluses were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1440.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The plan that was put in place once it was passed by each community, and the plan that notified our residents about the value of this process and the option of opting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1455.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So one other thing that I want to point out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1458.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: question that came about was who would fund the notifications, all of the work that needed to be done to let all of our residents know about the opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1469.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with our last meeting and having the director from Melrose who came in and spoke so well on this issue, we answered a lot of questions that were brought to my attention that people had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1483.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: asked me about and how would we find out who would pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1487.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it all comes under the company that would be awarded this project if and when it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1498.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my biggest concern wasn't the community aggregation plan because I think it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1508.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1513.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: constituent can use in bringing their electricity bill down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1517.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, not dramatically, but it does help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1520.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, the biggest piece was getting the notification out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1526.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic now in making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1533.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When that plan is released to the public, it's going to be very thorough and with as much information and time needed for our residents to opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1546.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, one of the issues we often hear is a lack of notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1551.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, with this plan, it falls back on the company that's awarded this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1558.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that in turn goes back out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1563.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this up, and I second her motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2789.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we tabled it because they didn't they couldn't complete all the questions we had and they didn't get to to explain their whole Communication plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2802.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a and then we're completing it next week So is there a way that we can get?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2809.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe the city engineer can give us some information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4531.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4532.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4533.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to be redundant, but I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4537.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the issues of having that master plan, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4544.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we wouldn't be true to this position if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4549.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: weren't looking at the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4551.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, as one person put it, to hold this valuable historic piece hostage, in a sense, would be frightening to me if we would lose it over the winter because we didn't fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4568.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we weren't part of those discussions years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4572.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the plan that was put in place, and with the CPA that's now in front of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4579.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we talked about last week, using the Brooks Estates as a viable revenue source, I think it's something that, as someone that worked very hard on the recreation piece over the past few years, and talking to our friends from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4600.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Brooks states and looking into different avenues that we can capture funding, I think it's a positive move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4607.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the thought of possibly losing the Carriage House to me is unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4612.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So one thing we did preach over the last few years is our support to our historical sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4621.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to, in my eyes, I feel that this Carriage House is one of the granddaddies of them all, so I'm going to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4630.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=75.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=76.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, I'm talking to the chair of the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=81.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they've been drafting up a few of the ideas and presentations of what we're looking for moving forward with development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=91.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest concerns that we hear now is the lack of housing and the lack of the type of housing that makes Medford the community that Medford is, which is housing for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=103.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that looking into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=106.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the rules and the policies that we need to jump in a little bit deeper in seeing what we're doing to make Medford continue to thrive as a community of families and looking to possibly increasing our affordable housing to what is acceptable in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=130.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we're still at, I believe, 10%, but I think it's something that needs to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=136.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another piece that's alarming, you can see it in our community next door, they're having huge concerns with residents there that were accepted into the affordable housing units in different condominiums and now are being told by the developers that are there that they now need to move out because of the popularity of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=162.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of selling those condos as individual units and they're being asked to leave and given a mere $1,000 just to move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=169.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=172.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I shouldn't say this before, but it's hitting us now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=175.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to take a more active role moving forward and ensuring that what we're doing to protect our residents here in Medford with our added development and how we're looking at affordable housing is presented in a way that we hold the values of our families in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=195.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, I appreciate the time, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=198.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=199.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=298.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=299.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=301.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This came about with conversations indirectly with the new director of recreation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=309.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: members of the park board and members of our youth organization and also my background in working with facilities management and playing fields and knowing what we're doing in our community where I work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=324.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and preparing our playing fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=326.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing that we know that our DPW is drastically understaffed and I want to make sure that as the weather, if the weather continues the way it's going now, we might be playing at the beginning of March in a few weeks, hopefully so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=342.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we need our playing fields in a position where our children<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=348.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can play in a safe environment and making sure that we're giving, making sure the city administration is preparing those fields and giving our DPW and parks department what they need to make sure that those fields are under, um, uh, supervised and make sure that they're, they're, they're, um, planned accordingly moving forward as we get closer to the season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=368.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=368.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=369.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=504.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a petition here this evening, if you can come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=516.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=524.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, Justin, the hours, it seems like the hours are gonna stay the same, and I know you provide a valuable resource to that neighborhood, especially to my son, so I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=538.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it seems like everything is in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=542.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move to accept this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=546.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=794.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=796.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, Councilor Knight for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=800.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=801.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're talking about such a serious situation, part of our discussion was the involvement of local politics and local municipalities to get involved, and really now pushing our state delegation to bring on to Washington what we think is something that needs to start at the local level, because we're seeing major<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=826.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: major catastrophic situations not being addressed by our brothers and sisters in Capitol Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=837.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the President has made some moves today, but I think that we need to now start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=845.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a local government pushing our state delegation to making sure that they're presenting our views here in Medford that we can't stand for this type of violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=856.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And say what you want about freedom of having guns, but there's a severe issue that's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=867.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the city of Medford should take ownership and start taking the lead that we can now push on to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=875.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: press legislation to change our gun laws in this country and making sure that the way people can purchase firearms are looked into in a more drastic, dire way because what happened this past week and what's happened for the last few years and so on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=895.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It needs to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=897.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It needs to stop today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=899.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we need to take an active role as local government that if our senior delegation is not taking that step, I think we need, as a voice of Metro, to now start pushing that along to our government, our delegation in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=918.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope that our, my colleagues,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=924.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support that and move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=926.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=927.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=928.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4731.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4733.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4734.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to... I won't be redundant what my colleagues have already issued, but I do have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4739.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have parents that need to talk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4742.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have to express my displeasure, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4744.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that how hard you work as an educator, one of the greatest superintendent minds in education in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4751.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we have with this situation is something that in many layers bothers me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4757.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former school team member, we were adamant that notification was paramount to whatever situations moving forward at that time, and obviously that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4768.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you coming out and saying that you're taking responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4771.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you saying that this isn't a forum for personnel matters, but I know as a parent, as a parent of two children in the Medford Public Schools, we need to see something happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4786.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There has to be something done, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4788.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something we're going to push to the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4790.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4794.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know we don't want to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4796.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want to live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4798.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I personally think the opposite now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4800.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4802.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are scary times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4803.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4804.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this would have been a great learning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4807.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine getting into a classroom and teaching the situation of bringing this type of dangerous ammunition and weapons into our schools and understanding how we could teach our children how important and how scary this is because it is scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4823.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Society today is scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4825.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4826.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I've talked to my kids about this just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4829.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, Councilor Knight and I talked about this when I talked about our local government taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4833.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then this happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4836.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so disappointed, so many different levels, because I'm going to beat the dead horse with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4843.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4845.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's ammunition to a weapon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4848.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of mass destruction, where kids have died just recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4851.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there is fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4852.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is heightened fear in this room and at home with our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4858.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I need you to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4860.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we don't want to be afraid and we don't want to, you know, we want to make sure that our kids feel safe in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4866.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I absolutely agree with you, and we do a great job in our school system making sure we feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4870.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know what, I think society has to realize, when things get done, it's out of fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4875.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is fear, this is necessity now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4877.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to have to start at this level, this is something that I'd have to put a huge black eye in what didn't happen in this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4885.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4886.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was bad in so many different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4888.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I'm sick of just even discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4891.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But moving forward, I know the parents need to talk, but we have so many members in our community, our school community, that you work so hard to protect and making sure that our students with mental issues and are disabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4907.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are our kids that are right in the front line of situations like this, that we need to get answers for to make sure they're protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4914.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, as a former colleague of many of those teachers there who taught with them and went through the lockdown situations in that course, I can understand, but we need to do more with this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4930.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to know that if it happens again, a bullet is enough, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4935.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A threat is enough that we have to let our children and our parents and our faculty know what's going on so we can prepare our children to make decisions what we think is right and safe for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4946.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, believe me, I hate to be a heavy, but I tell you what, I am so sad and so disappointed that this wasn't presented in that fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4955.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Dan Tully, he's a very thorough individual, and I'm sure he brought it to the attention that it was going to be reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4963.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4964.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to, you need to move on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4967.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that the investigation is one thing, but as a leader of our school system that I, that I entrust with you, we need to make, we need to make some hard decisions tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4976.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4977.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10011.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10012.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, good job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10013.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, I find the records in order to approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10017.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=824.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=826.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=829.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 27 Butler Street, Matthew, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=831.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, what I'm hearing on what we've seen today was horrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=840.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I hear and see from this committee is just as bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=845.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that we're looking at systemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=848.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something right now that's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=851.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=852.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter doesn't want to go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=856.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where is the urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=859.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where is your urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=862.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few weeks ago, we had parents up here talking about the fear they had about their daughter being beaten up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=869.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we had a consultant and I've asked teachers, I've asked students, have you seen the change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=875.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing, nothing, nothing has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=883.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to sit back, I'm gonna speak and then I'm gonna leave because I don't want it back and forth, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=891.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're seeing with my daughter, her friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=895.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I ran up to the high school just so I could be present for her, just so I could tell her her dad's outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=905.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see over and over again, I saw Madam Superintendent, this is not an isolated incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=911.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To write that this is an isolated incident and to say publicly this is an isolating incident is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=917.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=921.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=924.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm scared, and I'm disgusted, and I feel bad for my daughter and her friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=931.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this might be not the best thing a city council should do, coming up in front of a body and expressing themselves with this motion, but I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=943.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have principals and assistant principals that are running around that school with no support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=951.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for rules that have been implemented by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=955.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Give him back the tools, give them back the tools so they can run the school system the way they see fit to keep our kids safe, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=965.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then look at your studies and then look at your consultants and see what they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=975.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll be honest with tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=976.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for an emergency meeting didn't didn't go through only three members voted for an emergency meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=982.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a forum for people don't feel like they've been heard today to be up for the city council tomorrow and express their concerns and I will be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=990.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter will not be going to school and her friends are not going to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1050.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1051.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, as a parent, you're asking me to have a back and forth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1057.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a colleague, I haven't heard one word from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1060.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't had one word from anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1062.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've publicly put this out there because we haven't heard one word from any of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1067.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, one word, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1069.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, as a former member of this body, I worked diligently to make sure that we implemented a plan to keep our children safe from bullies, not the opposite, because that's what we're feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1081.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what our kids are feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1083.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you want to see it or not, our children are telling us that they feel that you're protecting the bullies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1090.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're allowing them to run the show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1094.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you ask any kid, any child up there, they're telling me that they feel unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1100.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're telling me that they don't have the structure that they felt in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1105.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to tell me that the tensions, suspensions, well guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1109.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're saying that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1111.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not happening, it's not getting to the ones that it's happening to, because the kids are saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1117.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids are telling me that there's no suspensions, that they're not gonna get detention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1123.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids are saying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1126.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe so, but let me ask you one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1130.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had assemblies for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1132.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After that incident with that young lady, did you bring that student body in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1136.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you bring that student body in and give them security to let them feel that they would be safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1141.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you, other than Go Mustangs or emails to people that if they get to them or not, did you sit in front of the student body yourselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1151.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After that incident, look them in the eye in the gymnasium, like you did when you were all there cheering them on for the football game, and look them in the eye and say, you're safe because of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1161.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're safe because we're going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1163.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1167.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1173.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't have to be a law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1184.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that, but that doesn't mean the tact and the professionalism that you have from your teachers and administrators up there to bring the rest of the student body in and to let them know that they're in a safe environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1198.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to disclose anything, any other news about what's legally can be said and what can't be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1204.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're all educated, very bright people to sit our student body down and look them in the eye and say, you're okay and this is why it's gonna happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1212.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not asking you to disclose any information about the perpetrator, the person who was injured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1219.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1221.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let the kids know that they're safe, because you haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1225.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7455.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7463.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7473.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to express that as a city Councilor, you will see resolutions from this Councilor that will ask you Madam Mayor, the resolution that if you came to our, our body for funding for licensed security guides to help our principals and assistant principals to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7491.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be a resolution, there'll be another resolution that the council would like to ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7496.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Members of the school committee, the police department, our teachers that we set up a team summit, so we can work with our children so they can tell us what they want, just like the brave young men and women that were here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7509.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that will be the dialogue that needs to be started, there'll be a few others, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7514.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As Mr. Puccio said earlier, we allow our parents to monitor lunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7521.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We allow our parents to monitor different various programs throughout the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7527.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's time that we ask those parents, and myself included, that we get more involved on a daily basis at Medford High School so the kids see our faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7537.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to be the policemen, not to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7546.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: express this, the communication that I've gotten back from students and parents over the last 24 hours and before, is the understanding that we are very fortunate to have a headmaster like Paul DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7562.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paul DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7566.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Paul DeLava will be very upset because someone's talking kindly about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7571.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Paul DeLava was part of that group that when I was a school committee member, he was a coach, he was a teacher, he loves Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7580.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever was implemented after that, whatever stigma that's out there that people are portraying what that administration can do or can't do, let's try to find a way to correct it and make sure we don't lose people like Paul DeLava and his staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7597.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if we lost him right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7599.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we would be going back years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7601.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=360.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=474.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=475.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's my privilege tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=477.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've had a tough week here in Medford, and this is fitting and needed to address a group of young people that have done our city proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=493.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And before I recognize anyone, if Coach Curley and Coach Offit come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=515.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just called them up just because next to coach curly, I looked like a supermodel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=521.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I wanted, I wanted to make sure he was next to me, but you guys, uh, I wanted to really put a resolution through a few weeks back to acknowledge, um, what the method Mustang football team has done and their coaching staff, something that's always, always overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=543.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is the impact that young people play in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=547.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy when it's something bad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=549.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it's something bad, everybody wants to talk about what the kids are doing wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=554.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I wanted to make sure that as I look through different messages that I received, I was noticing a trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=565.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was noticing an amazing trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=570.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that our football team is a special, special group of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=575.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I coached at Medford High School for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=577.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was lucky to be part of a great organization and a great team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=583.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing I realized, it's very important to have Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=588.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we're lacking right now in the city, true Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=593.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when coach Curley came, came to the program and before that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=599.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had some difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=600.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Numbers were low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=601.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids were getting in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=603.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we weren't winning games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=606.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody thought that the world was ending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=608.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you saw the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=610.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach Curly came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=613.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw him active in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=616.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw him doing special things with his, his team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=619.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all of a sudden the football team started becoming, became elevated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=625.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now the numbers have grown and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=629.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: positive things are in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=633.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=634.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my favorite song, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=636.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=637.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now, what I wanted to address is something very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=643.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is a Mustang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=646.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=647.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know people, it's easy to say Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=651.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What it means to be a Mustang is truly to love the city you live in, to represent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=657.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your community with pride and distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=660.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you boys and girls have done have been amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=669.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing I will say is that we have Coach Curley as your leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=673.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the key, having a leader you can lean on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=676.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A person that wants to be involved in a young person's life, no matter what the circumstance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=684.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy to say when things aren't going well and teams aren't winning and you're losing, it's easy to say, well, they're no good, let's get rid of the coach and let's start all over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=695.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I find so impressive and I want you to understand, this isn't about winning and losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=700.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You went to Fenway Park and you represented Medford with a lot of respect and pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=709.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why I put this resolution through is for what you're doing off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=715.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few things that this football team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=718.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've helped organize the national night out with the whole football team and the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=725.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Really showing what unity means and how everybody works together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=729.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You led that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=731.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In September, you helped empty out the senior citizens' basements and helped seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=737.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In October, you helped with the Unified Basketball League.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=742.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The day before Thanksgiving,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=744.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before Thanksgiving game, we saw you guys over at McDonald Stadium helping with the unified flag football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=752.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you saw a bunch of football players in yards raking out people's yards that couldn't do it themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=759.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now you're helping with the Medford Family Network for their toy drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=766.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=769.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wanted to have this opportunity tonight to bring Coach Curley up and really commend you for what you have done and really put you on the pedestal that you deserve to be put on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=785.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing is having the leader to show you the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=789.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's an honor that I talk about John Curley tonight because John's a very special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=794.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I love to hear is I got a phone call from a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=798.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, George, I saw this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=800.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need to share something with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=803.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a problem with the football player.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=804.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was being a little wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=807.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I called Coach Curley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=810.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the next day, Coach Curley was sitting in the back of the room, just his presence there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=817.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we realized is that young man wasn't offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=822.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was so taken back that Coach Curley was there to do what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=827.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To show him he cares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=828.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure that he's doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=832.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the type of leadership we need in our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=835.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you boys have done and girls have done and gone out to the community and put together all of these community service hours, it's something we should as a city applaud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=845.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna publicly thank you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=848.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we put together a, do we have that at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=861.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so we have accommodations that we put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=878.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the Muffet Mustang City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=880.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Muffet City Council award the this combination to and we'll say the young man's name, a young lady's name in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=889.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the Medford High School football team and your commitment to community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=893.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations on your accomplishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=895.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go Mustangs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=897.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, we'd love just to recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=899.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to call your name up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=900.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Coach Curley, Coach Offit are going to help out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=904.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, just before we get going, if Coach Curley has anything to say, I know that before we get going, I know we want to, I know some of the boys and girls want to get in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=912.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, Coach, if you have anything to say, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=985.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to figure one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=986.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Mr. Mr. Medford's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=989.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Chris Murphy, thank you for everything you do with the football association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=994.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=996.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You look fabulous by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=997.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=998.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=999.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1001.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1012.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, come on up if you're called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1014.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1015.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So come on all the way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1296.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, coach, I know that we have a bunch of coaches that have been committed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1301.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, uh, they've been great with the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1304.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you could just acknowledge them, I know Coach Offit is your right hand man, but anyone else that, um, need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1326.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, when you're a true Medford program, when coach Joe's, uh, leading you boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1330.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I appreciate coach for being, being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1333.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know he's at, he's at an appointment, but he's going to try to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1336.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If not, I'll come by the house myself and drop off his.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1339.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, what, what, what we did is we put together a certificate that's going to be, uh, in a folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1346.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to be really, we're going to be getting that out to you tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1348.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1349.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank you guys for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1350.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1351.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1356.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1361.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it's easy to point things out when a young person does something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1367.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like that's an easy thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1369.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm proud of tonight is that we're really putting you on a pedestal because you deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1376.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The opportunity, the time that you give on your own, like Coach said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1380.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we talked and said that no one forces you to do anything, but you go out and do it because you love the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1387.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what true community is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1389.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1390.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1391.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow Councilors, thank you and have a great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1393.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1394.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1706.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1776.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1842.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1935.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can, is the anybody representing the city to answer any questions on this call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1963.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the first time we've received this type of request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1984.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so structurally, it's not unsafe or it's not gonna jeopardize the area around the well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1992.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's pretty, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1997.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're recommending this, Owen, is this something you recommend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2004.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2099.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2135.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2137.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the petitioner here this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2139.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2142.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I've reviewed the paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2146.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything seems in order, sirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2148.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what type of, if you could just give us just a brief synopsis to share with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2187.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2187.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2188.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I was falling into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2189.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, uh, how many employees do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2194.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's it? Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2195.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and I hear great things about this, this product and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2199.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're excited that you're moving to Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2201.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2203.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my daughter loves it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2205.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's gonna be something we'll see in our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2209.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I see everything in order, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2212.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval after questions from my fellow councilors, if they have any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2266.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2272.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3660.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3662.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Penny, for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3663.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done so much for our community and I really appreciate everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3670.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3671.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, one thing I realized as I'm reading through this, this is, it's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3674.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, this is what we've let we've lacked here for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3677.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your effort, but, uh, a most vulnerable community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3682.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we, I didn't see anything with the housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3684.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we partnering anything with the, with the method housing department to reach, uh, those families that I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3691.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3707.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so obviously there'll be a big piece of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3709.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5118.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5119.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob, again, the other person taking the heat, and I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5126.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5130.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, and I'm not going to pile on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5132.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we should, you know, I think for preparations purposes, I think that maybe calling for a Committee of the Whole meeting with Bob once we have all this information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5145.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so we can sit down and really sink our teeth into these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5149.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that, so you understand, Bob, you know, something as simplistic as people that are watching understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5156.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when I was 14, I opened up a checking account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5158.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad said, okay, this is how you balance your checkbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5162.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how you spend your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5164.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you don't, if you don't have, if you have $100 in your account and you want to purchase something for $120, it's telling you you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5172.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, you're responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5175.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to control your own finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5176.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what was saying time after time here, we're getting papers from the mayor, we're getting requests from different Councilors about asking for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5187.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest, I haven't voted for a financial paper and approval in a long time, because I, I find it very difficult for this body to do their job, not understanding the basic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5199.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financial breakdowns of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5201.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were there when we had the tough budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5204.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was horrifying for you being new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5206.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we're going through this process, Bob, we haven't gotten one, one paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5212.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't gotten any information about where we're spending our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5215.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are, God, almost January, January one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5219.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want the public to know this is the hardship we're feeling in the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5226.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5227.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to ask questions about legal matters and we don't have anybody to turn to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5233.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that you have to be here tonight and really be hung out to dry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5238.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm curious if the chief of staff is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5254.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, can we address the question to her?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5274.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5276.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the Chief of Staff has been out for legitimate reasons and she hasn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5284.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She just started to ramp back up, but were you familiar that our finance director hasn't received any of this information from this council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5372.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I heard your answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5377.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't appreciate the response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5380.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this has been a total lack of disrespect to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5386.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have crises that we're dealing with right now that we're looking at financial support and hoping for some financial support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5396.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't know where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5400.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, so to move forward with any of these dog and pony requests, and then ask for funding for deeply needed, uh, resolves and not having an understanding of where we are financially is very difficult for me as a Councilor to make decisions, moving the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5425.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5428.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody that's watching and understands realizes how dysfunctional this community looks right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5439.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that we're seeing that coming across from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5443.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is so totally embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5446.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm disheartened right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5447.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Bob, again, I apologize for the answer that the chief of staff just gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5453.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding is this, we have been asking for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5457.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the day after we had our budget and we've been trying to get some information, some valuable information of where we're going, what direction we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5466.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to figure out what tonight's a very important meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5469.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's some resolutions tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5470.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about some very important issues and looking to fund some very important issues, but getting the okay from the administration to fund papers and then not understanding where we are, because I believe the mayor, you were there when the mayor said as critical as last year's budget was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5487.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: next year's is going to be even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5490.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what puts me on edge right now, Bob, is the fact that we haven't seen anything and we can't move to support our most neediest members of our community and resolutions that are coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5502.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this very disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5505.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find this very troubling and I don't know how my 16, 17 year old daughter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5516.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has the ability to run her finances better than what we're seeing with this multi-million dollar corporation called Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5524.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I know it's not you Bob, but I had to express my concerns and disgust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5530.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5718.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, I think until we have all the information in front of us and Bob has time now to get the documentation that we need to move this forward or to understand it, I think we need it immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5730.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that, you know, we've been asking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5735.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: forever so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5828.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5860.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5861.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate taking this out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5864.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been a very emotional last 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5868.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been very intense and I wanted to make sure that if you allow me to give a small presentation that I prepared so I don't miss anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5884.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford's in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5886.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a new crisis, but one that has started to spiral out of control and has just caught the attention of the outside world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5895.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, we had many years of warning given to us to prevent the latest incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5902.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we see today, those warning signs were ignored by the very people that were entrusted to protect our kids by acting on our behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5912.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most of you know my background as a former coach, teacher, and now Assistant Director of Recreation for Neighborhood Community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5922.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna look at a few fundamentals to see where we missed out, where we made our mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5929.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First thing that came to me is, are our kids safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5934.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5938.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the data that we need now, we now have the actual proof<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5942.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from our experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5944.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we doing all that we can to keep our kids safe so they can learn and grow successfully?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5949.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, the warning signs are there and we ignored it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5955.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we unified on this issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5958.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5960.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, some people take their responsibility serious while others do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5966.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question the personal motives<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5970.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of some to simply protect their income versus protecting people that got them elected or hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5981.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are outside groups currently bullying elected officials to exercise their views, which do not help to protect our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5990.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: National organizations, national movements, while we're having crisis here in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5998.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is our division hurting our kids and the reputation of our city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6003.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that's evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6005.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The division in this great community is tragic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6010.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it continues, we'll just see the first of many situations that will bring our amazing city even further down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6018.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, two heads are better than one, and four heads are better than two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6024.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unified, we will overcome together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6027.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: divided we will continue the sad, turbulent ride to a much worse place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6036.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, last night I was accused of politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6042.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My knee-jerk reaction was quickly defended to the categorization of being looked at and politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6053.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I thought about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6055.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course I'm politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6057.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because that's the only way, the only mechanism that we, our kids and the citizens have to make any changes to our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6066.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We live in a political system that requires checks and balances to protect our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6072.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So being attacked with this term makes no sense and showed me exactly how those that are guilty continue to deflect away from their own inaction, neglect and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6087.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we've learned that inaction equals action, meaning inaction enabled these outcomes, putting our kids in harm's way and making our parents petrified to send our kids to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6102.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the atrocity that we are looking at today, right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6110.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anyone has been politicizing this issue, it's those that have been both enabling these outcomes and hiding from the consequences of their own inactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6121.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were elected by the people, for the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6125.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's time that we get to work for the people, especially our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6131.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See, when we got elected by the people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6135.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It should not be measured by winning or losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6139.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It should be measured by the impact that we make and promises that we keep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6146.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our opportunity that has presented itself to us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6151.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was presented, what are we going to do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6157.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's what I propose to get us united, back on track and protect our kids the way that they require from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6167.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'm going to be asking the mayor to put together a team so we can put an implementation of safety that works with our teachers, our principals, our police department, so our kids feel safe when they go back on January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6191.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want them to feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6194.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Meetings, consultants,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6197.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6199.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have true professionals in our building that we can work together over the next two weeks to make sure we have that plan in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6205.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6209.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have resolutions in place this evening that would ask the mayor to prepare an RFP to hire and train true security guards, four to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6221.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure that we have full staffing in the video room where our staff can watch a minute-to-minute action and who's going into the bathrooms, who's loitering in the hallways, to make sure our administration can see where these issues are happening and get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6238.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the support there as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6241.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last night, I believe it was Tony Puccio who brought up a very simple resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6249.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We ask our parents today to do everything, to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6253.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he mentioned that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6255.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought that was a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6256.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I got home, I got a phone call from a former soccer captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6259.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She went to school in Tulane, worked in Louisiana, and she sent me an article about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6265.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a program they use in the schools in Louisiana where they were having issues and concerns like we're having today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6271.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Dads in the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6273.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe to be correct, we'll call it Dads and Moms in the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6277.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could put parents on a bus to go to a field trip to Plymouth Rock, then we could put parents in the school that want to assist our teachers to make sure they're just an extra eyes and ears as you walk the halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6289.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you, Mr. Puccio, for bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6292.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to ask the school committee to open up their meetings for public participation, where there's a dialogue like last evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6302.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if there's an issue with parents, students, or constituents, they have this forum to come and speak with a dialogue back and forth to make sure things are identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6314.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that's in place right now, as some parents can tell you tonight, very daunting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6320.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to put it through, to ask to get approval, to read something, to write something up and making sure that what is going to be presented is approved is another form of censorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6334.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If not, I'm gonna request this council to go back to the original request that Councilor Knight and I put forth as a ordinance change demanding that we put in place that format for the City School Committee so they have an avenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6350.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to have a voice and they can listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6355.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this has been a very intense last 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6362.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter didn't go to school, nor did I believe close to 400 other students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6371.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word back was that the police were there and they were present, but we also know that won't happen every single day for the rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6380.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore our school committee to work together with the police department to move forward to making sure that there's a plan in place over the next few weeks so we have our children feeling safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6401.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that leaves me with one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6406.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that she's not here right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6409.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I want, I heard something last night from a very courageous young lady and I want to leave with something that she said that I take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6416.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was directed to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6418.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's direct to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6419.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was very simple to, as she said, step up a step down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6424.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a responsibility and I hope we hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6430.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a responsibility to make sure that we're giving the tools to our leaders in the school, our principals and assistant principals, to make sure that they can run the schools as efficient as they did when they led the middle schools or before this administration, when they were part of the resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6452.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's unify this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6455.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's unify our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6457.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's make Medford the city that it's always been, an amazing place to live, work, and raise their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6467.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8015.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8020.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The funding was there for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8023.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was probably 80% of the funding that was cut for security over the last four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8030.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the funding was there and the school system cut that funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8033.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8508.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8513.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: trying to be restrained and understanding something very simple that I want to share with my fellow Councilors that gave their opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8523.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8524.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done that many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8530.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8532.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8534.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8535.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our teachers are scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8540.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To talk about money concerns and money issues should not be even a thought right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8548.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thought and the discussion of 30 years ago, five years ago, is an embarrassment to me for the fact that this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8558.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8563.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talk about unifying, I talk about what I said as a national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8571.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see and hear the direction that the school committee has gone on many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8580.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And some school committees members have called me in the past and just didn't understand that they wouldn't fight if they didn't have their own voice, but to follow this national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8594.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I'm seeing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8596.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that I looked at and trusted and admired, I'm seeing that they're taking not what's important today in our schools, not what's important, our children, not their safety, but to be in this council chamber yesterday and listen to some of these people that truly are aligned with people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8621.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these issues are concerning to the community to understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8626.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we need to put that away, open our minds and be unified in the fact that the unification is needed for the safety of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8637.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what happened five years ago, not what happened 30 years ago, what's happening today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8643.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gonna get the funding we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8646.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that, but that's not gonna change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8648.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So bringing that up right now is really sad to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8654.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just a buzzword and a check off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8659.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, we need movement now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8663.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need our school committee, our superintendent to move now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8670.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna see action now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8673.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's stop, let's hold school off for the next four days, three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8676.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring our teachers into a room with our principals and let's find a solution right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8682.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our kids are safe when it's time to go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8686.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the next few days are going to be useless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8690.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's going to be no learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8693.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to hear solutions from groups that are going to work together to make our kids safe on January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8701.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Safe when they go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8705.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to protect each other because what was said in another forum and how it was presented by this Councilor to people on different committees and try to protect what they're doing on the school committee side, I'm not afraid to speak for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8721.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Politically, I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8723.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are hurting and what people are seeing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8731.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what they're hearing from the school committee are gender items that aren't protecting or looking at their safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8740.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was questioned that I was part of that school committee and there are legalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8746.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understood those legalities, but you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8750.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it came to children's safety, George Scarpelli never swayed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8754.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made sure that they were safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8757.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I never had this situation when I was on the school committee, thank God.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8763.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, we can bicker back and forth and disagree, but ultimately, that wasn't my intention today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8773.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My intention is truly look at everybody and say, let's meet now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8777.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8779.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's set a plan that's tangible that we can reach, that we're not gonna get grants from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8785.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gonna get funding from City Hall, but there's ways to get that done right now to make our children feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8794.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9834.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information. There's a difference between bullying and passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9837.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what you lack, madam. You lack passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9893.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Madam president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9897.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Superintendent, yesterday a young man came to the podium and addressed the situation that happened. Did you hear the young man who described a very similar situation just a few weeks prior?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9911.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked the Superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9915.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was that addressed today? Did you contact the guidance Councilor that he talked to, to express the concern of the same people threatening him to stab him?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9927.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you address that today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9947.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10443.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would it be shocking, Madam Superintendent, that a few phone calls I did receive from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10449.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: personnel that were there to support, that there were still numerous students walking the halls freely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10458.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has that even been addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10499.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's good to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10501.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you approach the re-entry and starting the new year off, I would really hope, and what I've heard from the kids, is that your administration, yourself personally, bring the student body together so they can understand what's going on because they're lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10519.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Over the last incident that happened, they were waiting for some sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10523.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: acknowledgement of something and to keep them feeling safe, that was not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10532.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope moving forward on the third, that the student body is in one area that they can see the leadership of our school system to show them that we're there and we understand what we're trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10545.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That hasn't been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10574.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good to hear, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14642.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, maybe you didn't understand what I meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14646.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the fact that I wanted to bring it back to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14651.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to focus on today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14652.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't go back to 30 years right now and worry about this today because today is the crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14659.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14824.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14825.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15121.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15161.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15312.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15378.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15651.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GbhjYJ_J4oE&t=59.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=16.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1029.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Apologize, I switched over to my laptop so I can see the presentation a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1035.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Going back, I know that for transparency's sake, if we could, Council President, can we please make it a motion to ask for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1046.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Projections of new growth for the last 3 years through the chair through the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1053.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Assessor and the budget director's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1057.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, that just eliminates any questions that if I come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1060.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring something up and it's something that won't be questioned because it's coming from the department that's supposed to give us that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1068.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1069.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1078.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please the projections and projections and what we were what we end up getting if we could just for just so we can have an understanding of what we looked at in the past and what we actually had in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1091.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can at least estimate what we're really looking at because 2.5 is pretty pretty dismal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1117.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2899.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2900.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob, thank you for giving us this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2903.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what what what I'm a little, I'm a little nervous about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2907.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we just want to get through and get something on that will work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2910.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we saw it for a minute at the school with the school department with the, you know, the 2.5 million dollars that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2919.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they couldn't find and then they found and then there were a lot of budgets that were frozen and that really put the teachers in some difficult positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2931.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, just curiously on the city side, do we have any departments right now that we're looking to hold positions or cut positions or freeze their budgets for FY24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2945.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um before we can get into 25 because there are rumblings out there that you know there might be some key positions even maybe an overnight position at dpw that we're looking to probably eliminate for the rest of the year and that's these are these are um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2961.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are these are questions that I think we need to know, especially if you're looking at the budget moving forward and seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2969.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, having every department trend, just for the sake of numbers in a budget, where do we, where do we look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2977.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2024 with our departments on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3003.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3006.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So real quick, it's a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3010.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As our budget director, do we have any departments right now that look like they're in jeopardy of freezing their budget or not having enough for them to finish their FY 24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3084.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for clarification through the chair, so we might have some freezes in some departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3090.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that when I asked the question, just to move forward as we move forward on this, and I'm hoping that our budget director understands that when we're asking questions that also has to do with the ARPA money, I find it a little befuddling to me that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3106.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our budget director says he doesn't see anything right now, but the chief of staff comes up and says well with our blah blah blah That we there are no there's no Definitives on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3117.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can as we're trying to vet out next year's budget and understanding how we got getting through this budget You know, I think we got the quarterlies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3126.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think today we got one two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3128.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I saw them again today I really appreciate that but um, you know, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3135.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing some trends and some concerns moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3138.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could just get an update as a form of a motion for our next meeting, Mr. President, that if we do have any departments that are looking at some budget shortfalls in FY24, that we're prepared for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3154.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3211.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Mr. Mr. President, if I can, this is this is so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3217.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Bob, if you've taken that, that my comment and anything to be disrespectful to you, please don't think of that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3225.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm looking at when we're asking questions to our budget director in the past, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3230.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the past or in my other roles, when we have a question with the budget director, I would assume that they would have all the information in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3240.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you weren't prepared or worked with the other people that are working on this budget together and you didn't have those numbers, that's not your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3247.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anybody there took that as an insult, I apologize, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3254.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just stating the fact, in the past when we've had budget meetings, and we've had other budget directors, and we've had other administrations, or working in other city municipalities and understanding the budget, when you're asking a simple question as, do we feel that any of our departments in the FY24 budget look like it's going to be funded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3279.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would assume that we would know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3281.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You answered it by saying, well, from what I know, it looks like we're not going to have a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3286.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3287.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff then came up and said, oh, maybe the I believe it was the ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3293.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not we can't be definitive on that because of ARPA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3296.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I I tend to I tend to really get really disappointed when leaders of our administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3305.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: come to that podium and accuse members of this council just because they're asking questions because they haven't been informed at all when it comes to information on the budget and they ask a question that wasn't clarified and then turn it around and make it sound like I insulted someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3323.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been accused of this over and over again by this person and I find it offensive and that Mr. President and I hope you can take point to that because that is highly highly unprofessional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3334.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4178.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4179.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4180.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, can we get a copy of this presentation emailed to us, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4186.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've been held hostage from a virus, so if there's any way that we can get that emailed, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4196.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And next, just for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4200.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for us to prepare us, Bob, and I know, like, again, I appreciate your hard work, but when we're doing our projections, our department heads looking at going through an analysis with, let's say, a 10% cut, an 8% cut, a 5% cut in their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4221.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just so they're prepared for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4225.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that Councilor Beall said I missed, as we're talking to each department head instead of me asking them one by one, I know that Councilor Beall is correct from wrong when I missed the meeting last week that the conversation was that these were pure numbers that department heads gave us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4244.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'd be interested to know if they were given that exercise to prepare us for any sort of cuts moving forward for FY25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4270.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so but they're given to us as a wish list, correct, Councilman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4291.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but they weren't asked to do a cut proposal so that we can we can see that to prepare ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4298.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4299.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4300.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4302.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5797.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm in agreement with that, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5799.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward with that as a motion, if that's what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=17.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=74.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=79.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=81.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a long time coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=82.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=85.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if people know Councilor Caraviello and what kind of a person he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=92.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello ran for mayor, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=95.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In my view, he was a couple votes behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=99.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you would think that someone who's spent so much time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=103.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this chamber working for the Citizens of Medford, you'd think he'd be tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=107.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But last week, I think he spent over 60 hours helping an 88-year-old<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=115.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: young lady that was being displaced from her apartment who was battling cancer, and he drove her all over the city to make sure that she was safe and her rights were protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=130.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the type of person Rick Caraviello is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=135.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've had the honor of working with Councilor Caraviello as an elected official and as our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=144.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: past patriarch and someone that I mentored myself against, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=149.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To receive this award from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=151.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's perfectly fitting. And I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=157.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: miss you back here, but I know you're still working hard for the citizens of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=162.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should all take a great look and understand how Rick Caraviello lives his life, because if we had more Rick Caraviellos in this world, I think Medford would be just a supreme place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=174.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations, my friend, well earned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=751.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=752.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I have to put this forward for one simple reason, that the acknowledgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=759.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that yesterday was a very special day, and I know that some of my fellow Councilors were there and showing their support to our veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=767.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, my wife ran another half a marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=772.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was there supporting her, but I wanted to make sure that this body recognized all of the sacrifices made for our military men and women, and really showed that respect yesterday, and understand where we are today is because of our veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=792.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1403.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: parks, open spaces, historical sites, and affordable housing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1410.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1411.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this falls, just it falls in with the process and it's something that's so needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1416.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that it's been working, the process has been working, I think, in the cemetery and other places around the city to make sure that we take care of our tree canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1425.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1445.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1492.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1495.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A quick update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1495.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think everybody's waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1497.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So how's everything look?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1528.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1530.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1530.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, uh, Mr. President, I see that I know that we're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1534.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything right now is pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1536.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as you said, this is provisional right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1538.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1539.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward what we have in place right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1607.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3538.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3538.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I too feel, um, that we, we owe a certain amount of protection to our, our, our, uh, our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3547.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we have tools in place that we're just not taking advantage of here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3553.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, this council really can't do much for you, but what we can do, we can work with the CPA like the city of Cambridge and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3562.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put CPA funding to keep a mediation company on retainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3567.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when these issues happen, you're not scrambling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3570.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an avenue that you can come right here to City Hall to make sure that you're protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3575.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that's the beginning of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3577.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my fellow councilor feels that what we're talking about right now, we have a group of people that are in dire need, that are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3587.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I feel sympathy and I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3590.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with, now, say no different, no different than Brooks family feels than the residents that reach out to me saying, George, I'm 78 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3603.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived in a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3605.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I own my home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3606.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the process that this, that society has given us has, by success, has driven the cost of my home up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3618.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they live in a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3620.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now what you hear, you hear a council that says, let's have rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3625.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a tenure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3626.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3627.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a registration fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3630.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3631.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do... that's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3633.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we're on the same boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3635.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you have homeowners, and this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3638.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very, it's difficult when you have some Councilors trying to divide the community by calling things fear tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3645.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3647.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People are scared because it's the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3649.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you own that home and you live there, and you didn't expect your $18,000 home you bought 35 years ago, that is now a million dollars, because some people behind this real feel like, because that house is worth a million dollars, that person that owns that house and that has to live there every day, that that's a wealthy person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3669.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's the same person that's sitting back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3672.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the same person with the same fears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3675.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's not divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3677.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's try to find options like the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3680.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the CPA for mediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3685.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at our CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3686.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had Councilor Marks has been preaching for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3690.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the space that we have, that Medford owns, that we can sell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3698.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can allow building use on those small parcels that you could take that money and put it in to the affordable trust fund that, by the way, we haven't even established yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3709.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not even up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3710.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But imagine that funding coming in, that the Brooks family comes to us and says, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3716.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're being pushed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3719.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we could plant the seed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3722.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But listen, I can also go get an oak and bring it right here and plop it right down the middle of this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3728.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3730.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't don't let's let's be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3733.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I fear and I will work as hard as I can for this organization because I hate to see people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3739.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3741.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, you can't look at the other side and say, it's all your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3745.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're gonna move you out so everybody's in that boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3749.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to find the common ground that we can all work together to make sure that we all want affordable housing, that people aren't scared to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3758.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, listen, I think that one thing we should focus on is look at the developers that are coming into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3766.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: find a way that we have legislation behind us that would protect owners that or renters that live in their home that are being pushed out for for total gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3777.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I agree, I'm going to support you 1000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3780.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm going to make the motion that we ask us a CPA organization to fund a mediation retainer right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3790.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, as much as we all have good intentions back here, we don't have the power<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3795.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to do what needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3797.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we had Councilor Caraviello come here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3800.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He worked all last week on an 88-year-old woman that was being displaced, who has cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3806.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he came up to City Hall to ask for help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3808.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And do you know what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3810.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing, because nobody answered the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3814.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a City Councilor that's worked his tail off to make sure he's protecting a resident of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3819.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we all understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3821.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is where the unity comes in instead of saying that, oh, this is this and this is that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3827.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to figure out a way to make sure affordable housing is done correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3831.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we use the avenues that we already have in place here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3834.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just haven't tapped into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3836.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3868.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3871.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have the right to point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3890.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're ready, when you're ready, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3895.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the gavel today, I see where it's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3896.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But a point of information, I will tell you, the misinformation that's going out there was a letter signed by two of the leaders in this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3907.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what's scaring people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3909.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's actually actions not it's not words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3912.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's actions and your actions were something totally opposite<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3917.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, then why haven't we had the meeting on the tenure on the transfer tax then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3920.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why haven't we have committee on the transfer tax so we can point out and pick out what you just said, Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3925.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you came out and we sat as a community and said this is what we need. Let's not let's not hurt the homeowners like you said in that in that context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3935.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm for you a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3936.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we haven't done that, have you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3991.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3992.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3996.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Speak the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3997.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about not speaking the truth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3999.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4000.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The CPA is not phasing that out for one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4184.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4190.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are people getting evicted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4192.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4269.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, just to be clear, I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4274.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Today, I talked to a homeowner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4275.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to a homeowner today that has about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4282.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 18 feet that the city owns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4284.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're willing to come in and pay that 18 feet to build an addition for the senior citizen parent to move in with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4290.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it sounds nice and it sounds powerful to say developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4295.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not all developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4297.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have small parcels of land that homeowners that are bought these properties that will gladly pay, that would feed our trust to help communities like we have here at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4308.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5453.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, just if we can, what is the reasoning for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5458.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5460.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5472.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I would follow up that the mayor and it would be great if we had a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5478.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would really focus on the city solicitor really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5481.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: paving a way for this organization so they can have a point person in the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5485.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they could talk, not a city council that really we can't do much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5489.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can just also request that the mayor, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5494.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Get involved and use her, um, executive power to see what we can do to assist this organization. Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5508.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5522.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5523.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to at least investigate, maybe send the subcommittee that we can look at, you know, a request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5535.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, so maybe we change that just that we look to send this to subcommittee, that we invite the CPA in to see what that would entail, to make that a piece of the puzzle that one of our residents did say that put another tool in the toolbox with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5804.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5983.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, my amendment would be that, now again, this would be the whole presentation, so this is a little odd and a little bothersome to me as a city council, but I will tell you what we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5996.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The amendment will be that I would look for the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6000.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city council to ask the mayor make sure we get it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6008.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would like to make sure that we make a motion for the mayor to appropriate $5 to $7 million needed to level the school budget through the free cash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6023.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through free cash and by the process that we first take that, make that as an appropriation before free cash is certified and we announce for what that is used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6040.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now if I can, Mr. President, is that efficient?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6048.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll tell you what, Mr. President, don't appreciate it, but I will tell you, the question that we had was the, Mia's process and how she brought this forward and the irresponsible process that she moved forward on social media and then in city council and school committee meetings, where she talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6072.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the option of free cash being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6075.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $2 million is committed to fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6078.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $2.3 million is committed to an OPM design for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6084.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $1.2 million for OPM for the HVAC system issues at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6089.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to rebuild Freedom Way for $10 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6092.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to fix HVAC systems in the schools for $15 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6096.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Estimates for middle school alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6098.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to put more money on water and soil infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6100.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that good, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6101.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So can I proceed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6129.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I would present something and explain it to you and that'll get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6132.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll explain it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6170.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not if it's time sensitive to ask a motion to entertain this before the certified, the free cash is certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6215.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6218.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: shutting it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6219.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's used,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6224.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's an episode used to do that. Shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6264.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6327.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6328.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6331.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate for my fellow colleagues to help me express what I've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6338.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not going to get into what was said earlier, because I think that that's why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6344.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the communications that I received from residents with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6351.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the discussions of rent control and the, you know, the 2% tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6358.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're talking about, you know, the registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6362.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we're talking about what the mayor has presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6365.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What she said was a 2.5% override, which by the way, publicly, I will tell you, I'm not opposed to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6373.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She talked about debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6375.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not opposed to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6377.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I publicly say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6378.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was one of the only Councilors that brought a debt exclusion to this body that they've never done it before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6384.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6386.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand this process we need to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6389.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what comes to mind is I've said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6395.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we heard it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6397.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until we exhaust<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6399.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: until we exhaust everything in our pockets that we can show that we're not making mistakes and just being reactionary on taxation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6414.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I've identified many, many different options that the mayor hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6418.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've met with the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6419.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no permits out there for any sort of development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6422.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say development, I speak of the development that everybody talks about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6426.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just had a conversation about it, about affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6429.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor lost 600 affordable housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6433.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more importantly, she lost a huge tax bracket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6437.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She lost a huge, between 3 to 5 million, just in one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6443.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for permits and fees, one building, and look who we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6448.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the problems we're having right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6450.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this tactic by the mayor, by putting this out there, is something quick and easy for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6457.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's done nothing for five years, honestly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6459.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Beer Hall is her claim to fame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6461.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really haven't moved the city forward at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6463.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're not bringing new revenue at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6468.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so now what I'm getting to my point very simply is this, I didn't, I wouldn't support a rainy day account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6476.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I look at the options now, and the options I see have to be really expressed and understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6485.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a lot of people that have come to me, they're not against working together for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6492.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not against working together for a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6496.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but they want the data to prove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6500.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanna see, are we doing it right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6503.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't just put out a tax, just a tax, just to cover your keister, because that's what she's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6508.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that's your agenda, because you've told us this, but the bottom line is, let's listen to what that last caller said, Councilor Bears, the other night, because I think that's what brought this forward in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6520.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She asked you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6523.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She asked you, Mr. President, what if the override doesn't pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6529.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What if it doesn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6530.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you said, right, it's going to devastate our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6534.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vote is in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6536.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it feels, it affects our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6541.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6543.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6545.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if it's a 1% chance that that override would fail, are we willing to gamble our students' educational process for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6556.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, we can look at, as a council, bringing forth the rainy day account that the mayor asked for, we appropriate it correctly, we earmark that money, and everything goes level funding to schools, and maybe she can't do the Freedom Way for another year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6576.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at least that now brings two groups, and that's what it is right now, the people that don't want Proposition 2.5 override, and people that do want the Proposition override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6588.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we can do is take that time to sit together and probably, because I know Councilor Bears said it, there's a finance group that's been working since last April, I believe he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6600.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the mayor, I'm sorry, September, the mayor, the chief of staff, Councilor Bears, Council President Bears, Council Vice President Collins, and school committee member, Jenny Graham, excuse me, Vice Chair Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6615.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the five of them have been working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6617.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question that everybody's been saying is, well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6622.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have they worked on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6623.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Councilor Bears said, when it's time, they'll put everything out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6627.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for right now, we don't have that time to wait and put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6630.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because right now, are we willing to gamble our students' future next year on a possibility of this divide not making it happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6644.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know I got people emailing me saying that something went out on a social media site and shame on you, George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6651.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6653.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6655.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I read it, the question was, is this a fair tactic by the school committee and the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6663.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6665.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6666.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there were no other avenue presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6669.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was only one avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6671.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did nothing for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6674.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On June 20th of 2023, the budget meeting, I sat here and said, you're going to destroy our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6682.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are going to be in financial ruins if you pass this budget just because you want to get elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6688.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to use ARPA money, which by the way, which by the way, I use ARPA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6694.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're told specifically,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6696.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do not use ARPA money unless it's sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6699.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, our mayor took that money and the ESSA money, and the school committee did, and they've level funded a budget just to get elected because she didn't want a black eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6708.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6710.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here we are today now, here we are today ready to gamble on our children's future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6717.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's not a scare tactic, that's legitimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6720.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the override does not pass,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6723.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then quote unquote, our schools will be devastated with layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6730.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're gonna hurt teachers, we're gonna hurt children, and we're gonna destroy this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6735.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore my fellow Councilors to please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6739.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6740.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's put the motion through that we ask the mayor to bring through a rainy day account that we appropriate the funds needed to level fund the school budget and make sure that everybody is whole because that was another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6755.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a phone call from school committees where they were astonished the other day that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6759.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the chair, I think, was astonished because her answer was, no, everything goes back to the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6765.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the superintendent sat in front of us the other day, and I've got calls from teachers, I've got calls, that's not true, they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6772.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's manipulating for what they should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6775.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not being transparent enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6778.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I please, I implore you to let's, let's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6783.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's focus on free cash, level fund this budget, let's build on our children's future, and then work on if we really need an override and debt exclusions, and then work together as a community to make sure it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6797.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6849.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on you. Shame on you. You're just a bully with a gavel. You're a bully with a gavel. You're out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6857.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You let me answer. I have the right to point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6868.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're willing to gamble on kids' future on an override instead of looking at real money that our residents, that the mayor mismanaged and left out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6878.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6937.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can't, we can't move forward and discuss it and the mayor can't move forward to look at the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6951.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=13.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=45.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=99.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=100.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed of this wonderful news that we have two amazing Method residents that are sharing their 70th wedding anniversary, and I wanted just to express our deepest happiness for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=117.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that they have three very proud children, Josie, Janet, and Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=123.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanted to make sure that their parents were recognized and just an amazing accomplishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=129.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And 70 years cheesy, that is something to really to applaud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=136.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=137.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=159.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=299.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=383.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=385.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=473.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1434.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1436.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1910.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1913.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, again, a very popular location and it looks like everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1920.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will move approval after we hear from any questions from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2064.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question the chair on the ruling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2068.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4573.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4574.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I will share the probably the only comment that I agree with the mayor is that an override should go to the community, but if it's done right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4589.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last meeting, I posed a question about using free cash and showing the process so everybody could see what it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4600.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just for the fact that the possibility, now maybe the mayor can answer this, in November, Madam Mayor, if the override happens to fail, what happens to our school department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4630.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You usually are, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4657.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4659.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we would take that gamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4661.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4663.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll revert back to June 20th of last year during the budget meeting, when I'm sure you remember the meeting that you had with both Councilor Bears and President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4675.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as Councilor Bears stated before, it's in the minutes, it's in the video that Councilor Bears met with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4684.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4686.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you came to an agreement and he's going to vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4691.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did was you sold your soul because what you did is I felt like Nostradamus because as I said that night, what you're doing is going to put our city and financial ruins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4705.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4706.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4707.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that when we look at where we are today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4710.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what we talked about back a year ago, we've had one year knowing that this was gonna happen and what was created to make this less harsh for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4724.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4727.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You started a financial task force of you, the chief of staff, Council President Bears, Councilor Collins,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4738.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe vice chair Graham and the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4743.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is our financial team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4748.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talked to neighbor communities as they lunged into these proposition two and a half, I talked to Mayor Curtatone, who informed me back in 2009 when they faced the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4762.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what neighbor communities do for, I believe the word's been thrown out there, transparent, which I think is an absolute farce being used that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4772.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they did back in 2009 to that community, they set up a financial advisory committee provided with expert advice from both savings and revenue production measures designed to help the city maintain its financial strength and face this deepening economics recession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4789.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They looked at a committee which had Samuel Tyler, president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau of Free Assistance, Jonathan Sloan, the president and co-CEO of Century Bank, Jeffrey Hartigan, senior vice president investments of UBS Financial Services, the Chamber of Commerce and leadership team from their financial team, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4818.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Daniel Richards, Professor Daniel Richards at Tufts University and in the economics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4825.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I've been saying, that we might need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4830.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4832.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why divide the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4833.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why gamble our future, our kids' future, by not doing it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4838.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4840.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We met behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4841.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sat in the meeting since I believe Councilor Bears said September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4846.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've had meetings that we've had no updates, no minutes, no notes, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4850.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears stated that when we get closer, he will give us all the information possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4859.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we've got, we got a message from yourself that we are now going to just jump into an override, jump into debt exclusions, and jump into very, very scary times for a lot of very vulnerable residents in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4875.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course, when I asked for debt exclusion, I worked with the best financial mind in Aleesha Nunley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4881.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You remember her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4882.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aleesha Nunley, who was an award-winning budget creator,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4889.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she was, and when she broke it down for us, we eliminated senior citizens, and we eliminated veterans to see what that exclusion looked like for new fire stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4901.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the numbers were drastically different, but we were making sure we were taking care of the most vulnerable members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4908.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I asked for the other day was, when I was unceremoniously ruled 21,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4915.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and made quiet again, because what I was saying made sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4920.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Taking that money, five to $7 million out of free cash, and balancing the budget, and then working together by being more transparent and open in the process of an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4931.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You mentioned that the process, that looking at the process, it's only $440 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4944.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that's minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4945.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, that sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4948.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what's scaring our residents, maybe you're not listening to them or even hearing them, especially our most vulnerable, when you're looking at a transfer tax that was mentioned, rent control that was mentioned, a registry fee that was mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4962.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about a debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4968.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's probably $250 million debt exclusion for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4972.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who does that fall on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4975.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our homeowners, and a lot of these homeowners that some of my colleagues think that are rich because they own a home of a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4984.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'll give you an example of a person I talked to today, and when she said, George, I'm gonna be honest, this scares me, because her and her husband bought their home in Medford 60 years ago for minimal money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4998.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now their home's worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5001.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that million dollars now, because of the tax rate, now these little add-ons, as you called it, they're just small, as they keep adding on, these most vulnerable members of our community are petrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5014.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They fear where we're going with this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5018.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I would have asked you, Madam Mayor, is looking at the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5023.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and where we've been in the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5026.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we done to create new growth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5028.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we truly done to create revenue to support our streets, our sidewalks, our schools, our fire, our police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5036.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5037.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've had 340B projects that you turned your nose to that they've all walked away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5042.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars, millions of dollars in revenue through tax and through permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5051.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5052.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just that alone in three projects that we know of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5056.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this process, this is a total farce when you look at what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5062.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different processes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5065.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I mentioned, here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5070.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was mentioned on Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5073.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is probably the biggest, biggest motion, resolution to come in front of this council ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5082.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5084.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have no meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5085.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about this as a council, community, and not once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5090.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've had five meetings on a newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5096.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you're talking about affecting thousands of people, thousands of homeowners, we haven't had any discussions, except for you and your financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5107.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't seem like a financial task force at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5110.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what it reads is what it reads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5112.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if it walks like a duck, it smells like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5115.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys went in the back room, and you found the easiest way so you could be let off the hook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5121.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that is by debt exclusion to override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5125.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5127.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5129.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I showed you what other communities do, what they've done in the past, and how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5135.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked to the superintendent who came up and talked to us about making it whole, and her saying that, no, it's not going to make it whole for what we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5143.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I believe Vice Chair Graham mentioned to one of the city council, I believe Intoppa,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5151.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When he asked the question, if we get to 79 million, will everything be put whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5155.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5157.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent sat in front of us and said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5161.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's gonna take more money, just like you will, and put it into a black hole that we don't know where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5169.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the proof is in the pudding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5172.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our numbers aren't very good, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5175.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we look at our education numbers, we don't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5179.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5180.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we provided more funding to the school department above all other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5187.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not to say we don't need more, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5190.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's how it's managed right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5192.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a weak question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5195.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the dog and pony show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5199.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everybody patting each other on the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5201.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this was a complete joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5203.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lack of transparency, lack of communication with all members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5209.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll say it again, I don't disagree that we might need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5215.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say that from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5217.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we haven't done is we haven't done this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5222.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you've done tonight, if you caused enough divide in our community, Madam Mayor, we are now divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5228.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, I've had hundreds of people call me on both ends, 100 people saying, George, we need an override, and having great discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5236.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've also had hundreds of phone calls from people that are saying, no, this isn't good, and we're gonna fight on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5244.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So instead of sitting there together as a group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5248.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and putting it together and figure out the best course transparently, what we can do for our community, we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5255.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On June 20th, you sold your soul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5261.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This task force was put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5266.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sat here doing nothing, because you knew this was going to be nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5268.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad you could smile, miss, because you're really affecting hundreds of people's lives here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5273.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you come out and come out out of all this work, not knowing what you did, for overrides, debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5283.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I will invoke Rule 21, which states<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5295.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dispositions of all items appearing on the city council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5299.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All items of business appearing upon council agenda shall be taken up in the order their parents and fully openly debates the disposal of by vote of council previous to the consideration of any other item of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5312.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No item of business shall be referred to committee except for the following reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5317.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the study and the report of subsequent meeting, for the purpose of drafting an ordinance, and the event that open discussions may prove damaging to the character and reputation of a person or persons, all matters referred to the committee shall reappear on the council agenda for the meeting for four weeks following the referral, unless sooner presented by the committee chair or a majority not exceeding two weeks is voted by the council upon request of the committee chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5344.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: majority committee memberships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5346.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5357.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you might've suspended the rules, but I want the community to realize you stifled me last time disrespectfully shutting down rule 21 because I made sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5370.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it was a viable way for us to slow things down and do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5375.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tonight, you suspend the motion for this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5379.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well I invoke rule 21 this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5383.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I have to, I would look into contacting our attorney and looking for an injunction to see where this goes, because I think this is a fraudulent process by the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5394.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7005.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7008.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the dialogue back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7013.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick note to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7015.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The presentation you just gave was the same presentation we heard at the debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7021.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, no shovel in the ground, no money in our accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7026.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing at Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7028.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7032.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And councilor Tseng, immediate funding is available when you start these projects and permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7039.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my biggest issue I'm having here is not the fact that, because people are gonna leave tonight saying councilor Scarpelli is against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7048.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's not what I, I've said this a thousand times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7052.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And councilor Callahan said, democracy is so important, getting the vote out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7057.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7060.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why behind closed doors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7062.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why weren't we involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7065.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would you announce it on a Friday and then bring it to the floor on a Tuesday and then vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7073.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Especially when there are viable options that we know of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7077.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7080.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can use the five to seven to do everything you said to pull in the hot strings of all the parents and kids and teachers who, by the way, are my friends, my relatives, my family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7090.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand completely, but there's an option there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7093.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then maybe step back and say, well, instead of dividing this, instead of making this a contentious situation, let's sit together and say, well, did we look at the process of eliminating seniors to this process and how much would it cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7108.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we look at eliminating veterans from the process and see how much would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7112.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7115.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Democracy isn't saying that six people in one room say it's all right and that's the way we should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7122.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's democracy, no that isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7124.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Democracy is being open and honest and being truly transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7130.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about looking at where the funding was and where the funding's gonna go because when I say the black hole, I say we were given millions and millions of dollars from ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7143.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we do with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7144.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing to show for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7145.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Infrastructure needs, it was the airport, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7148.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could get angry all you want, Madam Mayor, and turn your head, but you made some pretty snide comments tonight, and it's pretty embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7154.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, I will tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7158.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You put on this paper, excuse me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7163.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, Madam, I believe you said it was that we needed to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7171.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that were getting jobs illegally or questionable, and you were cleaning up City Hall, you've used that comment a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7183.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I tell you what, I'd like to sit down at these meetings and say, well, look what they've done in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7188.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where did the funding go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7189.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7190.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how do we fix it moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7193.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used in consultants, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7195.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used for investigators, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7198.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we spent on for legal fees in the hundreds of thousands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7204.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used in settlements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7207.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are millions of dollars that we wasted because you put a cape on and thought that was your job, and that wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7214.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the courts, obviously now we're hearing it and we're seeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7218.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will be honest with you, again, it would have been nice to have some time to sit with the community and figure out, or at least all the council, because it seems like six people know what they're doing in the council, but there's one person sitting back saying, well, I had questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7236.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had things to offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7238.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I came out and started sharing that on the council floor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7244.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was pushed by asking me to put the amendment first, then I was asked to verify comments, and then when it started getting heavy and it started making sense, we sectioned 21-me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7258.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we get to tonight where I think we do need breathing room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7262.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need another week to look at this, to look at this and ask some questions and make sure people, through the democracy, the process of democracy, that people ask these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7274.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can pat yourselves on the back all you want of this task force, and you came to this agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7279.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to present all the information from this hardworking task force that was presented to the public on a Thursday or Friday, and then brought out for a vote tonight, is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7292.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really, this isn't the way democracy works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7296.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know if you, deep down inside, I think all of you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7301.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7305.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a lot of people do want to speak, and again, I'm just going to leave off with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7310.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a mechanism in place that could have taken care of our children, our teachers, our parents, all these coaches and teachers that you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7319.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through free cash, which we had millions because of the process that was mismanagement of finances in our community for the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7328.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And an abundance of that much money is just bringing it back to who deserves it, and that's the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7333.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, that's the taxpayers' money that weren't spent correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7338.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we have an option now to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7342.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of doing that, we're gonna rush through a vote tonight, which it's sad to say I will vote no, not for the fact that Councilor Scarpelli doesn't think that we possibly could use an override, but we didn't do it the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7357.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did it behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7359.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you wanna say it was a great process, whether you wanna say it was transparent, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7366.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7419.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have no city solicitor, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7460.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever puts you to sleep, Madam Mayor, every night, that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7463.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I sat next to you for four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7467.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7467.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I respect you, then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7471.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7476.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I just want to remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7479.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want the mayor to remember that I remember that person that sat next to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7484.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she wouldn't deal with what's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7486.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7488.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever puts you to sleep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7830.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can point a personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7834.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7835.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say this to all due respect, whatever Mr. President makes my colleague feel good, but what he did was stifle the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7844.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7845.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked questions as the chair of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7849.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I answered your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7850.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did not rule it out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7852.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move forward with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7854.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it started getting uncomfortable, my colleague ruled to shut me down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7859.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7860.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why I shut it down tonight is because it just doesn't matter because the process is already through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7870.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're asking for, and what I was asking for, was never entertained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7875.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It couldn't have been entertained, Mr. Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7880.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if I said what I needed to say tonight, it would have needed time for the administration to look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7886.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7888.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking at an override and taking senior citizens out of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7893.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Councilor Collins has mentioned over and over again, that's transparent and there were notes and all due respect for the vice president, Mr. President, those not the questions that we had, or I had, or the people that I represent had out of those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7911.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what we had was the options of doing A, B, or C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7915.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with those options comes processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7918.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, we need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7922.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, were there any other options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7924.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if we did do an override, what would it look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7929.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what my questions were going to be driven through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7935.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8590.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, uh, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8594.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I asked for debt exclusion, the finance director at the time, Aleesha Nunley did a study that excluded our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8604.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my comment tonight would have been through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8609.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would have been interesting to see before we got to this point, if seniors could have been excluded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8617.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, but I, I believe there's council bears says it's, it's a mass law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8622.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe there is a process that you can work with the state to get that exempt by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8627.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14300.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you repeat that again, Council President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14301.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14332.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14366.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14372.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14422.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14545.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14595.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14747.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15185.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15189.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also appreciate the resolution because it definitely is something that we should understand and with a little compassion, but to what relates to the proposed site, I think it's also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15212.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: conversations I've had with former addicts and, um, and people that were once on methadone that really stressed to me that, uh, the location is, um, is something that should be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15226.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, to help the city find a location, um, that would be suitable, but, um, in the area that's being requested where it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15238.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a few blocks from the school, across the street from the dance studio, a park right down the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15245.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are some concerns there for the residents and the parents of the Roberts school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15254.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that has to come into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15257.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15259.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, like again, this isn't coming arbitrarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15262.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is coming from discussions that I've had with, uh, with addicts themselves and who've, who've told me that it should be in a place because, uh, there are some serious concerns there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15275.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, although I appreciate my fellow council bringing this forward and I feel for, uh, and respect, um, a resolution at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15286.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, in the same breath is understanding that, um, having the location in part of the community that could negatively affect so many, um, we have to look at their well being as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15301.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16944.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16946.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NkdSQu8o7Y4&t=91.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody was against the process of helping people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NkdSQu8o7Y4&t=96.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what everybody was looking for was making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential inhabitants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=677.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=680.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every community should have a Tom Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=682.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I admire Tom for his conviction of what he believes in, and Tom was the person that fought for what he believed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=691.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if anybody wants to know why the Brooks Estates is still standing and why it's still a great piece of our community, it's because of Tom Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=701.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't wait to see him and shake his hand and thank him because he put a lot of time and effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=708.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are many, many nights that we would butt heads and not agree, but we would always respect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=717.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I admire what he did for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=720.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully someone's ready to pick up that torch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=723.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=947.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say some nice things So we have known your family a long time and I just want to commend you and thank you and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=964.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's people like Sylvia that kept Medford moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=967.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know people think today's times might be a little difficult, but I remember some really tough times in Medford, and it's the people that made this building what it was and what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=980.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's people like yourself that I personally am gonna miss, and it's like, I think that it's a piece of history that'll be walking out the door, but at the same time, you left a legacy here that I hope<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=993.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: everybody would follow because you've done an amazing job for our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=998.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that this is going to sound bad, but I know you get paid every week and not a lot, but what you gave to us is priceless and we thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1008.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for everything you've done for the city and enjoy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1327.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1479.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1480.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Janice DePace, I've known Janice for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1485.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember her children participating in sports, and I remember teaching with Janice while she was at Medford High School, and now she's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1498.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on to bigger and better things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1500.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1501.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's just a great person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1502.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you know Janice DePace, she has a smile on her face and a special word for you just to keep, just to make sure you have a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1509.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was like that with her students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1511.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that everybody that crossed her path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1514.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So she'll be missing the clerk's office, but she's earned an amazing retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1520.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1672.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1846.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna thank Mrs. Lasky because I had the honor not only to be a parent of a child in her class, but also a colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1855.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were the pinnacle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1859.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were what everybody wanted to aspire to as colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1863.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you never, you never wavered in your emotions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1872.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were just a great teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1875.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were there for every single child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1877.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know the impact you made in my child's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1880.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, dad's an elected official, but my son could care less about politics until he ran for fourth grade president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1890.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he woke up one morning with a suit on and he says, dad, can you hold this behind me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1895.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1896.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He said, it's American flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1897.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1898.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, I'm going to give my speech with someone holding the American flag behind me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1902.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, how come you didn't carry it with what dad's doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1906.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, you weren't in Miss Lasky's class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1908.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to Justin's point, I remember when he came home one day, he met Mr. Lasky and he says, I know what I want to do for my future, dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1918.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, why, what do you want to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1919.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, I met Mr. Lasky, and I want to be the reason why we clean Mystic the lake so we can all swim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1927.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just those impacts that we made, the growth and respect to our environment, the little lessons that became huge lessons today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1941.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you from the bottom of my heart because it takes a village to raise your children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1944.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were very fortunate, the Scarpelli household, to have you as one of our children's teachers and teaching them from right and wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1952.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1954.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You earned the retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1956.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's a huge void at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1958.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember when we started, that was the A-Team, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1961.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be in the same breath<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1963.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as you know, I think was by default with my position, but to be in the same breath as when they called the 18 and talk and stand side by side with Don Alaska gave me a sense of pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1973.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1974.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all your work and enjoy the retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1978.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2015.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would like, if we can, Mr. President, is bring Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2017.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lasky back, and we send her off with one of those wonderful citations that you draw up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be great if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2025.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2026.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe invite the whole Lasky family, because I know we haven't seen them for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2031.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2132.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2133.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We recently lost an amazing person from an amazing Medford family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2141.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had Lauren Kane passed away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2143.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that didn't know Lauren, Lauren was an unassuming but very powerful figure in our community for the fact when being a police officer, a female police officer, wasn't the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2161.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she took that job with such pride and such vigor that she started as a young person, as a teacher, and then moved on to be a police officer, and then moved on to hold<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2173.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to hold huge positions with the drug enforcement team and making sure that she played a huge impact in making sure that drugs weren't being distributed to our youth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2189.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she worked for the DEA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2191.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She worked for the city of Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2193.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most of all, she worked here for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2196.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's a sad day for, uh, the method police department that they lost one of their own and, uh, she will definitely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2205.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would ask that we send our condolences to the cane family for, um, for a person who really gave her life for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2214.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, we may she rest in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2217.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2556.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2837.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2838.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So first I want to commend the neighbors and the residents that really pulled together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2845.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you see in front of you is what happens when you see that something might affect our neighborhood in a negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2855.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I found amazing is I went to an organization, a group of neighbors put together a meeting at the Fireman's Club, and I think probably about 130 people showed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2866.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we heard from everybody there with respect and honor to every individual involved was that nobody was against the process of helping people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2879.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what everybody was looking for is making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2894.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amazing to see the community rally around this and really start a grassroots quick organization to really rally around and just educate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2906.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2908.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have, what I realized in those conversations, there were some people very angry at George Scapelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2915.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and deservedly so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2918.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something that we talked about with our leadership team here that when we did the recodification of our zoning and we implemented these type of facilities in the medical field, in the zoning process, that it was then going to go to a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2937.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We realized the impact it could have now legally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2942.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the facility like a methadone, and people keep saying clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2947.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what really brought a lot of people to their feet was it's not a clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2950.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There weren't people there to assist people that were addicted, but it was just a distribution site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2958.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2959.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had people that were involved that were both former recovering addicts, and we talked to administrators in the field, and they really shared an input that really educated a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2974.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, at the end of the discussion, it wasn't that, let's keep these people out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2980.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it was, if it's needed in Medford, let's find a location where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2986.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they can get their help and the support, but at the same time not affect a residential area that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2992.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Feeds away from a dance studio, a school, the lack of parking in that area affecting small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3001.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there were a lot of little intricacies that played a huge part in what that neighborhood, the effects it would have had in the Salem Street neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I had some issues because we wanted to make sure that without a city solicitor, I reached out to the mayor this weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3023.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She had an attorney that's well-versed in these topics to call me to make sure that we didn't say something that would get us in trouble later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3033.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that with this motion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3037.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as this process started moving forward, you saw that everybody was listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3042.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw that every department in the city was listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3045.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor was listening, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3047.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Appeals said, one of the biggest questions was, well, how do we make this a hybrid meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3053.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there are people that couldn't make a Zoom meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3056.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So making it, opening it up to everybody in the community so everybody had an input in this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3066.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion tonight would still be for a moratorium moving forward, but working directly with Mrs. Hunt and the mayor's office and making sure that we look at our zoning to make sure that any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3084.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any facilities under this criteria are moved into non-residential areas where it won't affect our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3093.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, there's still a process, but that would be my recommendation and my resolution if we can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3101.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the meetings are hybrid, so everybody can still attend those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3108.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3109.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I can't thank<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3114.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This sometimes is elected official, you look back and you say, geez, with this process, sometimes being a politician, you get, you know, your colleagues have one way of thinking, you have another way of thinking, and kind of get a little discouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3127.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing you do know is that you all love the city of Medford, and we're all fighting for the right reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3134.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I saw<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3136.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this past week with community members rallying together to make sure everybody was heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3143.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I loved, there was, you know, I'm getting phone calls from young people that have young children in the schools that just moved to Method a few years ago, but in the same breath, they were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3156.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: introducing me to their 88-year-old neighbor that they were making sure that they felt comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3161.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3163.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really took care of our neighbors with this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3166.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to say this again because we talked about this issue too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3171.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This wasn't to divide at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3172.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that people are looking at social media and saying, this part of the city is saying, suck it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3177.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This part of the city is saying this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3179.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These people are saying that, you know, shame on you for not wanting to take care of people that need support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3185.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3187.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With everybody I talked to, it was an open mind, but with the goal of making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3193.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These types of facilities are located in the community that doesn't affect our residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3201.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I give them all the respect and pats on the back that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3209.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate this company that realized that maybe this isn't the way to go and didn't want to continue with the fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3223.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For now, Salem Street is in a better place right now because there were a lot of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3230.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it wasn't just what people would think that with the methadone distribution site coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3237.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People were concerned about the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3239.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People were concerned about the small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3243.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people were concerned about that whole corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3245.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it was really expressed in a mature, responsible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3253.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: diplomatic and not divisional conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3258.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3259.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, I am so impressed with, and as I move forward, I'll put a motion through Mr. President later on, that we convene a community engagement committee that brings in the talent we have in our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3279.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, there are some amazing people that are in the field of addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3286.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are amazing people that are engineers, and there's amazing people that work with traffic studies, and there are doctors, and there are legal minds that really came out and shared their expertise for the greater good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3302.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to be negative, not to go one way or the other, but really to share an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3308.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend everybody here for being here and following through with something that they knew that was going to impact their neighborhood and this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3316.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to see that a wrong is righted and we'll be working hopefully after we pass this resolution that we work with the mayor's office and the community development team and really try to change that zoning so we're not in this position again that we're making sure that if it's needed then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3337.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we'll have a location where it's not gonna impact the community like it has in last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3341.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3343.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3951.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to clear clarity with the Council, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3957.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have the Council, we have a representative that the city had hired to work directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3965.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3967.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, what I put in as a motion is legally, um, you know, acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3973.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to put something in that's going to negatively affect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4129.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we could just move forward and send this to the subcommittee in zoning and we stop the process as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4148.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think we eliminate the moratorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4150.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've taken that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4151.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we restructure the motion to ask to refer this to the zoning, our subcommittee in zoning to draw up the legal and proper terminology to move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4165.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4222.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, can you give us some guidance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4223.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have residents that have worked very hard on this issue that want to be heard tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4228.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there's a possibility that they can express their input and their time and effort they put into this, I would recommend or ask that you would allow them to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4251.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so if you want to speak on this, you'll have to wait at the end now to public participation, and you can speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4589.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're in a good place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4592.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this is productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4593.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're in a recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4594.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8238.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10550.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to make that a point that was mentioned, questioned by a few residents via phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10561.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10571.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make the motion that we approve the special permit and with the 30, 60, 90 day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11184.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11186.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11188.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we are committed to support the CPA, I think that there's some clarity maybe you can help with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11194.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when we first voted for this, it was a matching number by the state, correct, at the time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11202.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It still is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11203.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we seen that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11204.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we getting that money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11205.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We receive it every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how much is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11242.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's 14% this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11249.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scrivner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12816.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all your work, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12817.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12818.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions that residents called me and they're just concerned that yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12823.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, and I appreciate the developers and having that control, but the conversations I had with a few neighbors that here are a few homes that aren't in the historical realm, and they would need approval to change the color of their house or a window frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12842.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they've told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12843.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe we can dispel those rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12883.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's, with developers, listen, I support this and I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12889.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what I'm hearing is just the neighbors that are saying, what's recommended for materials if they had to make a change in their home and they're living on a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12902.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how that could relate to their processes if they needed something to be remodeled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12907.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the biggest concern and where it falls in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12911.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that really hasn't been delineated for, okay, this home was built in 1974 and they want to replace some windows and the windows might not fit in the criteria that we might be looking at with the commission, but it's affordable for the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12931.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sure so i think that that's my biggest concern with this i don't think that i've heard that it we've been saying that it's been recommended but if they say no what are the ramifications um well i was gonna put this on the slide but but but um we've actually never said no okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12957.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But how long are you going to be there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12962.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12977.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12978.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like I said, I think that what you're doing and what we're doing that in that neighborhood for years, I mean, and I know that, you know, for my friend sharing music, who is a strong proponent and former former school commember with myself and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12993.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, I know the passion she had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12994.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not like I said, it's not, this isn't something that I would talk against because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12999.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that the biggest piece is that everyone has the neighbors that are concerned that many people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13044.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you and I appreciate who's here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13047.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear is if we're putting the disordinates in, it's the next group that comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13051.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they come in and they have a hard line and they're like, no, we're not gonna do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13054.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you get to control who.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13058.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, no, we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14808.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14810.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last week, I know we had a very informative meeting on the budget a few weeks ago when we talked about the processes and where this money is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14820.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we voted for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14826.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and an override that put forth the onus on the children in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14835.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I put forth a recommendation to look at free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14840.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We then noticed that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14845.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were informed that in this packet that we've now have $9 million added to that free cash to roughly $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14853.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm curious, when you went through this process, did the financial task force identify, did they know about that $9 million as it's going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14877.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that my fellow councils, we have five money papers in front of us, and they, I believe, what was it you implemented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14891.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the rules to avoid Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14896.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will do this with all the papers tonight, but as my right, I'm invoking state law under Chapter 43, Section 22, which reads, Section 22, any ordinance or order or resolution may be passed through all stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the Council objects thereto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14917.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14921.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to vote that right for the fact that we're pushing things through and we're not getting the information, at least this council is not getting the information they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14930.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a tactic that's very silly that we're going to try to get information that was passed, that was information that was given to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14939.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I made sure that we reached out to the state legal department and they said, any budget paper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14946.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is invoked, our ordinance is invoked, then I can supersede that with the state ordinance until I, as one city council, who finds this process so faulty, and so smelling with the lack of transparency, that we're so confused of where this money is coming from, and I've used this many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14973.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're all very bright people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14975.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying anybody's doing anything illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14979.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm telling you this is financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14981.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for a $7.5 million override on the fare of our families and children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14987.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to propose a $5 million free cash proposal that eliminate that fare, then the community can look to see whether we need an override or not, which I wouldn't oppose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14998.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But instead, we required it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15001.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was stifled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15003.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we moved to the next meeting, which was the budget meeting, and we had similar questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15009.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we move to the next meeting, we come up with $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15014.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have $34 million in free cash, with an override still hanging out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15021.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we still nervous about the kids in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15023.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I have the right to invoke this rule, and I do so, and I will do with all money papers tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15029.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15045.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been instructed by legal industry that this is a money paper that I can implement at my disposal, in my discretion, and I do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15055.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I question the chair, if you wanna stretch this out even longer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15067.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am opposing rule 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15085.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15086.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15087.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15089.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to play the game, so I'm playing the game with you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15092.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15093.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's kind of funny that when you want to talk about information, I've implemented my right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15157.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you want, I've questioned the chair, I've put in the rule moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15183.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15184.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The rule is not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15186.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15187.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15190.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you pulled this last week, I did my due diligence to make sure that the information is getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15195.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, we can have five meetings in subcommittee about a newsletter, but you wanna take these motions on money papers and force it down people's throat without giving it its due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15207.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15306.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll text you, Ken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15307.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15308.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15313.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you talked to the administration for $9 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15320.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 20, the July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15325.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You agree to call on Bob anytime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18136.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=110.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=111.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a sad day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=115.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we heard the passing of probably one of the finest teachers to ever grace the hallways in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=125.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Robin Irving was a very special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=129.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She made it her life's mission to take care of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=133.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's over 40 years of service, and Robin fought the fight against cancer and lost her battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=145.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's ironic that today's her 70th birthday, and I know that the family has put together a GoFundMe page to make sure her name carries on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=155.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in her name to scholarships for deserving children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=157.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanted to mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=160.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was an amazing person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=162.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had many friends that had Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=165.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving, and when they talked about Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=168.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving, as if they had a mother out of their home, someone that took care of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=173.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when I was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=177.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: awarded the position to be a McGlynn Elementary Phys Ed teacher, I was honored to work on the other side of the door of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=185.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=186.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you ever went by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=187.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving's room, you know that she was a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=194.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She had everything she needed for every kid with every single lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=200.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was tough, there was times she was tough, but everybody respected her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=205.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we heard the sad news, I'm not less of a man to say, but I cried in my truck because she was one of the good ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=215.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just wanted to reach out to her family, especially her nieces and nephews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=222.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know how much she loved them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=226.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And send our deepest condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=228.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a person that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=231.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you wanna name a library after, or you wanna name, leave someone's name to show their legacy, Robin Irving's the teacher that deserves that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=244.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So goodbye, my friend, happy birthday, my friend, and thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=658.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=732.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=734.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The point of my resolution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=738.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Councilman and I use the words transparency and accountability very often, and I do too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=743.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These words count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=747.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the count only if we not only talk the talk, but we walk the walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=752.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As this City Council is well aware, I submitted a letter to the Attorney General and the State Auditor's Office expressing my concerns over the way the City Council has used Rule 21 in Mass General Law, C-43, Section 22, unfairly and in a self-serving way to eliminate the discussion of resolutions that call for the expenditure of millions upon millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=780.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When papers from the mayor were before the city council on June 7th, the council suspended the rules and approved the motion that the council rule 21 not be allowed to be invoked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=792.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then on June 25th, my request to invoke Mass General Law C-43, section 22, which allows any one council to postpone consideration of a paper for one week was ruled out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=807.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At both of those meetings, my hope was that we could have an appropriate amount of time to discuss these significant issues and also receive input from our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=818.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the council leadership ruled my request out of order, I had no choice but to bring this to the attention of the proper state offices to receive their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=829.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state auditor's office responded to me quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=833.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and reviewed my requests and explained first the requirements of the majority of the city council and the agreement of the mayor to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=841.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's the simple part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=844.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this council feels confident that its actions of those two meetings were correct, then your confidence in your actions can be reflected in your yes vote to allow this review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=858.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be true transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=861.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If however, you're not confident that the council's action were correct, you should still vote yes for this review because then we will have guidance from the state as opposed to an opinion bought and paid for by attorneys hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=877.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be true transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=880.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: However, if you vote no on this resolution, it will show the residents of our city that this council uses the words transparency and accountability as a punchline that is empty and deceptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=896.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now is the time to stand up for what you say you believe in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=902.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let everyone know the only thing greater than your hollow words is your cowardice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=907.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, I will ask as a form of a motion that we vote to send this to be reviewed by the auditor, state auditor's office to look at our finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=920.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'll say it publicly again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=922.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have not one time mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=926.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that there is someone doing something illegal with the city's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=929.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My questions have been and stymied for one factor, one factor only, financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=939.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move that question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1213.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1639.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me make it very clear then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1643.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In both the letter and in the resolution, I asked for examination on everything possible, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1650.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I want the examination of our city finances, and I'll be meeting tomorrow with the Attorney General's office and talking about the legalities of the processes we have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1664.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, it's funny, Mr. President, that my fellow Councilors mentioned some pretty outrageous comments, like as this was something that wouldn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1677.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1679.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last four meetings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1684.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe you don't have YouTube, but Councilor Lennon made sure everybody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1688.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our meetings are on YouTube now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1690.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Watch those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1692.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1694.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You tell me about working together and council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1699.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny that you talk about disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1703.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course we've had disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1705.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course we sat across an issue and one lost and one won.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1709.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1710.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But never, ever, ever has a sitting council been silenced the way this council has silenced me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1725.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no different than Councilor Callahan speaking about, it seems to fit the narrative whenever it suits your mission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1735.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I remember when we had an issue concerning a legality dealing with a newsletter, and I said something very simple in regards also to the letter that was sent out to the state regarding the transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1751.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1753.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made a motion that we ask for an opinion from our legal team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1757.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe you voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1759.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe all of you voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1762.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that stymied the talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1764.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That stymied the process that you yourself just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1770.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you sit back and you start talking and you're spewing to the public that this is divisive, that this isn't true, oh, these are all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1780.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These aren't made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1783.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You suspended the rules so rule 21 could not be invoked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1790.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were talking about millions and millions of dollars that this council got on a Friday and voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1799.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what you talk about transparency and accountability?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1802.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1803.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of walking it through with this open, deliberate conversation, as you just well stated, we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1811.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We shut it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1813.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We disrespected this councilor and my ability to work for not the 7,000 people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1822.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not for the 7,000 people that elected you when you knocked on their doors, but when I put my hand up and I swore to uphold the rules and regulations and laws of this city, I represent all 60,000 members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1843.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit back and spew this disingenuine dialogue that these are lies, that what I'm saying is mistruths, these are situations risen on the fact that you, as the leadership team of this council, you stymied the process of open discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1863.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1865.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You forced me to go out and ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1868.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In regards to my fellow Councilor reaching out to the art of his office, great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1874.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I forwarded our city clerk the email that was sent, so I could share that with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1881.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When did you forward that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1882.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1882.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just got it, so I just forwarded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1884.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good morning, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1886.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for your correspondence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1888.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In order for our office to examine these issues, we would need the request for the city of Medford itself, and then it broke down, which Councilor Callahan so eloquently said, it's the vote of the council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1901.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it's the vote of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1903.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yes, the city would have to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1906.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And oh, by the way, yes, the city does do an audit every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1914.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions that I would have brought up that evening and the previous meetings before that, that I was silenced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1920.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We looked at situations where we had millions of dollars in other avenues that we can make our school system whole to protect our students, our teachers, and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1930.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I was stunned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1932.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then the following week, we got the email, right, that we just found another $9 million, $9 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1943.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1945.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's an opportunity to openly discuss, transparently, with accountability, discuss this process and say, where did it come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1955.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did this happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1958.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why can't we use this to support the education process now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1962.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what has happened, maybe you stick with your 7,000 people you knock on their doors, but you've woken up this community to the fact that whether you believed in an override or you didn't, people are questioning this community's process of fiscal mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1981.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1990.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to call this, sorry, not Council President, to call these allegations, I think it's just disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1997.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These aren't allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1999.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're saying in actuality, what I put out there, what I've tried to say for the last four meetings were lies and I made them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2009.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's simply not true, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2011.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm ashamed that you even brought that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2013.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could go to every single meeting and watch it yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2017.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I had were questions that my constituents, our constituents in the city of Medford, were asking me for answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2027.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all it could have been, even that evening, when we questioned yours and Council President Bezos' signatures with your titles on that letter that supported a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2039.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All that could have been done was a simple yes vote, voted to legal, them telling me this is what it is, Councilor Scarpelli, and we moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2048.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I have an answer for multiple constituents that called me about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2053.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than this situation or what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2058.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made it a mockery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2060.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The night of the budget was a mockery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2062.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about a disgrace in a Zoom, in a show?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2065.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2067.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mail with the snide comments and the linking back and forth, disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2072.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2073.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2074.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys look perplexed like this never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2077.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go back to YouTube and watch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2080.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead and watch it because it's disgusting and it's appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2083.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit back and call this, these allegations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2088.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I protested that vehemently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2091.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2093.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you forced me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2102.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2104.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We sent the letter to the attorney general and the auditor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2108.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The attorney general hasn't gotten back to me yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2109.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll meet him tomorrow, we hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2113.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor's office responded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2117.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The response that I got that I shared explained the hows and the what to dos with this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2127.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this motion has come up that we vote on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2132.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: passing this over to the mayor, having the mayor make a decision, sending it to the auditor's office, and then having them come in to look and see, not what the audit that we're seeing done when everything is prepared, but at the end of the year, when we find $9 million of mismanagement funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2152.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's unheard of, because as most people in this administration love to do, they contact neighborhood communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2159.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They love to put these charts up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2161.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2163.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The average increase in free cash in neighboring communities are no more than $4 to $5 million, and that's excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2171.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2176.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you people stifled me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2178.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You shut me down that we couldn't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2182.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those aren't allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2184.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2185.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2186.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2188.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know when this comes out, I know that it hurts me, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2193.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hurts me because I was voted just like all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2197.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was voted, but when I took the seat, I made sure whether a person agreed with me or not, that I made a decision what I think was best for the whole community, all 60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2210.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But from what we hear from my fellow councilors, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2213.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2215.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2217.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll go to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2218.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I'm very clear on the vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2220.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's examination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2221.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the motion to have the auditor, this council, to vote to allow the state to come in and put through an audit through the state to see where we are and what's been happening with our funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2235.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2236.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, moving forward with the Attorney General's office, we'll see what they say about the management and the style that this Council President used over the last few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2250.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That has been an absolute atrocious display of leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2254.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'll come out in the next meeting, and I'll make sure I'm a little clearer for everybody when the Attorney General answers those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2262.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2263.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2281.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got the letter the morning I sent it through the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2284.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2285.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2286.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the response from the, the response from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2292.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor, I had it this week, and I forwarded tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2297.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You forwarded at what time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2299.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2300.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2301.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2301.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2304.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so that's what you're going to win on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2305.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's how you're going to play the gutter ball, you've got me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2308.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2308.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've got me, bud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2309.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2310.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2354.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2355.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2357.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the law between the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2358.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2360.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2362.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2363.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2364.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2366.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2368.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You obviously don't know who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2370.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2371.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2372.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please recognize the law that indicates that I'm the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2375.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2447.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When not, I'm going to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2837.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2838.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3484.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3486.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to address a couple of the comments that people use my name directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3490.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On that first meeting, when we started the discussion talking about possibly using the free cash and being stymied, and then stopping that conversation because we all knew the process the following week would be the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3509.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next meeting would be to talk about the budget and possibly vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3515.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we attended the next following meeting, which allows me to then discuss that resolution that I put forth, I took it off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3527.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took it off the table to eliminate the nonsense that was already passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3537.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The idea to send a resolution through and explain the resolution, the option of thought process of one Councilor, who by the way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3546.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understands that sometimes it's inconvenient for people that come to a vote to 100 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3553.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have the responsibility of thousands of people and making sure that we're doing our due diligence with all of the finances and all the financial questions we have, that I took it off the table because it was too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3571.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion that was presented the week before was to discuss the process so we can sit with the mayor and understand the process and get some answers so we can move it forward one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3584.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was stymied, that was stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3587.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it wasn't that I stopped that meeting because of lack of transparency or didn't want to openly discuss something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3596.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a moot point, we moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3599.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything I said there eliminated anything we could do because the mayor was ready to move on her votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3606.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand that, that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3610.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, let me share some shocking, sometimes the administration doesn't tell us the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3622.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you realize that even though you rushed the vote, even though we realized we got information about finances no more than a few days prior to that, that there were still multiple layoffs and we lost many, many teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3639.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3644.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3646.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could have waited and move this out a week after and got the information that all of our citizens wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3652.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not the 200 people that were here that found babysitters, but everybody, that's our responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3659.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3662.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made a choice to service the people that service you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3668.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's blatant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3671.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You talk about, Councilor Tseng talks about just picking up the phone, call the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3679.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't trust the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3685.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They work for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3688.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say I don't trust the departments, I speak with the rank and file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3694.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they privately talk to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3698.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can't use their names because they're afraid of what goes up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3702.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not throwing fuel on a fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3705.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3707.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You brought up the question why I simply didn't go to these department heads and talk to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3712.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3714.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The key words in my resolution are transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3720.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I want something to be transparent, I'm going to bring it up here in front of all of these people so they all understand the process, not sit in a director's office that they can appease your agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3736.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3738.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you said it yourself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3740.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said it yourself, that was a very important meeting for the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3744.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a very important meeting during the budget to get that approved because there was fear that teachers were gonna be laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3753.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simply not the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3756.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, this is a simple, simple resolution as I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3765.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just to send this off to the auditor and get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3770.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a true indication of what the financial mismanagement that I see and others see, that we get the answers that are needed and required as we move forward, especially when you're talking about what you were asking for in November, when you talk about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3785.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's very important that we get the message out so everybody doesn't make a decision out of anger or lack of knowledge or lack of what was done during the budget season, because that's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3801.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3803.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Say whatever you want, but that's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3807.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why this community is so divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3811.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't, this is just one council standing up to make sure that the whole community is listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3819.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the 200 people that showed up for meeting and they were gonna be inconvenienced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3823.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because honestly, I know all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3826.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know you're very bright people and we've talked a lot<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3830.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I talked to you privately and I said, realistically, y'all given information about $9 million on a Friday, without talking to anybody, even okay, we talked to the directors, but then we go to move on a vote on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3849.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Truly, that is definitely not enough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3851.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been doing this long enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3853.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not enough time to get the answers that this community deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3859.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3862.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what was said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3865.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, this is the process of the council, and the process of the council, you went through with the letter of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3872.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You motioned it, you voted it, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3876.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, say what you want, Council Vance, we worked together, and the council's working together in the room right now, broke a rule that we can use against transparency and open dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3888.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Never would have done that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3889.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have lost the vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3892.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have lost the vote, but it was understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3894.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And same here, hey, when I sit and I lose a vote, I take it and move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3899.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to be stymied, that's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4475.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4480.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4483.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I just have one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4484.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4486.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to expand on what Councilor Callahan mentioned about the process and how everybody was here that night and they were so excited about the override and giving the voice to the people first time voting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4504.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you remember the conversation and if you remember the dialogue that was set forth in my motions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4511.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was the fact that we had a financial task force that we didn't see or understand how they got to that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4522.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't see how they showed us why we need an override, what got us to that override, and what are we gonna do in the next steps to make sure that we don't need another override the following year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4534.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4535.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a transparent process that we were asking for that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4540.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course people came up and voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4542.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course they want to be told that we should go on to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4546.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4548.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're not listening to the people that are right in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4552.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As many of those people that came up and said, we're for it, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4557.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have the same amount of people that are telling you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4560.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4562.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're not hearing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4564.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find it a little disturbing that the process of silencing or discussing or transparency or accountability would have come out in those meetings and discussions when we had the opportunity before the votes came out and understood, okay, the financial task force met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4585.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no minutes, no understanding how they got to where they did, but we're gonna come out with a $7.5 million override, a $30 million debt exclusion, which by the way, you're gonna be shocked when the firefighters come knocking pretty soon, and the understanding that not just a week later, we find $9 million more in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4611.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That alone, if that doesn't open your eyes and say, well, geez, Councilor Scarpelli, eliminate all the negative banter, eliminate one side or the other, geez, that's exactly what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4622.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yeah, maybe we should look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4627.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though, Councilor Tseng said it, you just said it, people came to that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4631.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course they were in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4633.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the problem was the people that had questions weren't listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4638.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a lack of transparency and accountability, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4641.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4643.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4646.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you might be confused in the verbiage that I'm sending the auditor, but let me simplify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4651.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking the auditor, with our vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4657.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to look at our city's finances, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4662.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll move forward with the Attorney General after I speak with them tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4666.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe they have something to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4668.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this isn't a very difficult, you can make this a convoluted resolution and be very confusing just because you wanna sign it, but it's a very, to everybody, it's a very simple process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4679.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My resolution states that we ask the state auditor by a city council vote and then the mayor's approval<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4685.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to come in and look at the city's finances because I question the process of millions of dollars in free cash and the process of how we got to certain votes when it comes to a financial task force that didn't have minutes to explain to the public what's happened to this community financially, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4707.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4707.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4833.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, one more last comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4838.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring this point up so we can all understand this, that one of my number one motives of moving to free cash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4847.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not leaving it up to a vote, is that during subcommittee, a resident asked a very poignant, moving question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4856.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happens if the override fails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4861.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Bear stated, it'll be absolutely devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4865.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be massive layoffs in our education process, not word for word, Council President, but it'll be a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4874.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My process was saying, why gamble right now with a total future and not using the free cash that we had in front of us, and then work together as a community to look at other options, but we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5340.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Donna, are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5358.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eileen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5368.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eileen, I'm requesting to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5457.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, um, jessica healy full lock road i'm just wondering why there's really even a Issue with having an outside auditor come in from the state I supported a hundred percent And we did just hear from a lawyer who also agrees so i'm not sure why this Has been such a big deal and all this arguing over just having someone come in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5483.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that use our tax money and pay them to do an audit to be very transparent and put everything to rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5490.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think everyone would just like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5493.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5904.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President, if I can, just to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5912.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5914.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5916.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've talked about the audit that's done every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5920.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that, the piece that we really would benefit from, from the state audit, isn't just, the audit that we get every year is the figure, the money line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5932.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it comes out, like I said, I don't question<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5936.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's being used fraudulently in the sense that it's illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5941.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My questions I have, and something that the state auditor's office will do, is audit the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5947.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not only the figure, but the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5950.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what we're seeing with being the biggest issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5953.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the audit comes in and they say, yep, all the numbers add up when you add up the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5958.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when the year is over, when the year is over and the mayor presents $9 million,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5964.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process has to be investigated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5966.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6031.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council might've known, but the financial team, they definitely knew there was $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6602.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Peers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=16.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm honored that a friend of ours who's worked so hard for firefighters to capture grants and take the pressure off our citizens and our tax base, Secretary for our union, Danielle Marcelino is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=31.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=251.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=15.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tonight, we have to thank my team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=18.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so many of them, but I want to thank everybody that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=21.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're from all Medford, if you could just raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=23.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just thanking you for being here tonight and helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=26.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=31.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a few events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=32.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know tonight's a tough, tough night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=33.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we had about three different events tonight, but we said we need to do something because things are happening really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=42.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason that we're here is because we wanted to talk about the Proposition 2.5 override and the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=48.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are three questions that will be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=52.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you some more information later on after a few people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=58.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one is the debt exclusion, which is for a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=66.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very fortunate that we have one of our union leaders from the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=71.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Danielle Masolino is going to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=72.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's going to speak in a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=74.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And proud to say someone that I called and asked his opinion because I think he is probably<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=82.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the smartest educational mind, at least in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=87.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's someone that I respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=89.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sad to say, I don't think people respect him enough until that person's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=94.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I called this gentleman and I asked him some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=99.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within five minutes, you just feel better because he just educates you with his knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=105.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked him if he can come out and spend a Friday night to come out and speak and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=111.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: give his opinion and what, you know, his perspective as an educational leader, someone that ran our school system for many, many years, still works at the state level, high level at the state, and he's gonna share some of his knowledge, and then we'll fill in some gaps that people had that had some questions, and we can help educate everybody so they understand what this means on November 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=134.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, I'd like to introduce my friend Roy Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1393.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1479.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1834.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Beas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1837.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I did take some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1839.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I contacted our code enforcement officer and like we thought, Panda Express is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1846.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has done a great job with everything they do and above board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1851.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1852.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I went through and talked to some neighbors, I think there's gotta be some consistency with our decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1862.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We voted to keep the permit, the hours of operations for Raising Cane, Dave's Hot Chicken,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1872.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we have the wings wing stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1875.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think all of those restaurants and those establishments have a schedule from 11 o'clock to 11 11 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1884.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1884.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I think that we've heard for some neighbors that live directly across the street and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1893.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and that there are some residents in that area, unfortunately, directly across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1898.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't be able to support a special permit at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1903.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that under the umbrella of being consistent, respecting our neighbors and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1914.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: past outcomes and decisions that we made for local establishments that are in that vicinity, I would recommend that we do not support a special permit at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1926.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2763.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Councilor Bears, Councilor President Bears, and thanks Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2766.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's time to bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2769.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For someone who does manage this type of facility in neighboring communities, I think it's going to be important to get the cost analysis because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2781.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, community in financial crisis, as we are right now, looking at Porter parties at a lot of our facilities could be very, very, very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2790.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, what would be what would be, uh, what we've done in, uh, in, in to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2798.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hold the burden off our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2801.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We kind of maybe want to look into neighboring city facilities that we can use in different areas instead of the port-a-potties in different locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2815.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that might be something interesting to see if we could set up a map or a partnership with city facilities that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2821.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: residents that are using a certain park or location that they can use those sanitation facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2828.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I will tell you it is a a huge expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2833.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2834.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, um, when we look at apples to apples that are coming up pretty soon, it's something that's gonna be interesting to see where we're going to tighten our belts as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2845.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2991.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3798.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3799.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3801.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I very well put Councilor Callahan, but to further to expound on the free cash is the essential, the amount of money communities have over-budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3814.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And according to the Mass General Department of Revenue, free cash represents the amount of community funds that are unrestricted and avail of appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3822.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For example, the city of Medford has not had a city solicitor for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3827.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that money would carry over year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3831.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every year a salary from the city solicitor includes annual budget, because no one is receiving the salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3836.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The amounts of that, if we put aside, city solicitor's salary goes into the city's free cash reserve for the city administration, the mayor, to use as they please if they need so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3847.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So how does the community use its free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3850.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cities and towns in Massachusetts use free cash after it's certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3853.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Mass Department of Revenue is responsible for certifying free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3857.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After a city or town submits its financial information to the Department of Revenue, a community will receive its notification, the total amount of free cash, which is certified, therefore available for appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3869.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, does Medford have free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3872.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3873.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford has free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3874.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As of September 10th, we were looking at a total of about $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3880.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is certified free cash, which means it's available to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3884.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially in crises when you talk about underfunding a $5 million deficit in the school department, that's what that money could be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3893.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then with the vision of financial minds working together to see if there are other avenues that we should use other than overrides, I feel it would be prudent for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3907.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So most communities, the four and 5% that's been mentioned, most communities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3913.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you see a two to maybe $3 million of free cash after every budget year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3919.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, you've consistently seen with this administration an absurd amount of money going into free cash because revenues were under projected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3929.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe that's done for a reason, or maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3933.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that we would love to know with more transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3937.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, this community, our community, our leadership team,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3942.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3943.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it leads us down a very, very slippery slope and it's dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3948.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So while we have the free cash and have the opportunity to not put the fear mongering into the community about teacher cuts or school issues or our children, why not use the free cash and eliminate those fears and then sit down like we talked about in the past where I was shut down by this council to look at a more, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3970.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: transparent, open form of participation to see where we need to do these three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3976.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One understanding how the city got to this financial situation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3981.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are we going to fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3983.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And three, what are we doing never to see this ever again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3987.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council and this mayor and this administration haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3991.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to ask for an override right now is just absolutely frightening, especially to the homeowners that are living on a fixed income that we're looking at possibly losing their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4001.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in the same vein as my fellow councilor asked to vote for the override, I'm going to implore to our residents that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4010.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is two different cases, two different stories, and it's going to be important so people can understand the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4017.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the truth is, the city has mismanaged its budgets and mismanaged its organization in the city for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4028.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we see this with a $9 million certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4035.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is unheard of, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4037.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yes, it is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4039.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you do take money out of free cash, it could possibly hurt your bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4044.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have $34 million, taking $5 million out to make sure our schools and our children have no fear of what might happen down the line, why wouldn't we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4057.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4093.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4097.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I couldn't get my hand up fast enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4099.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we sever this, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4100.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think with the financial questions we have in our community, I would support the traffic motion, but I think that we would have to look at this separate piece as something we can hold off until after the override vote is taken because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4121.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we are in fiscal crisis and this vote is taken in November and it's voted down, this could be crucial money to assist for the fraudulent process that was put forth to us where we hear all these cuts going to be made in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4137.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would request we would sever this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4139.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a motion and then uh and really think twice before we vote on any money paper right now um dealing with um dealing with uh with any any project that doesn't have to do with safety or our children seniors so thank you that's a formal motion thank you sever is there a second on the motion to sever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4528.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=19.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=28.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=40.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that reads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=43.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That exclusion on fire station shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=72.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: incidental to related there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=78.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=82.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, I thought you supported the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=85.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=96.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=103.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how they've been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=105.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=109.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=122.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're willing to stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=126.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=132.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financially for an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=136.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please do not vote for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=141.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=148.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=155.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=161.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=167.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=188.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=196.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=202.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=207.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=220.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=222.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=225.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=227.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an issue that I put forth years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=230.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=242.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we never saw sidewalks being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=244.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could never catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=246.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know my colleagues say, see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=249.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=250.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=252.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=254.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I love the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=261.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=270.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=280.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we been resourceful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=283.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=290.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=293.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=301.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=309.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=318.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We showed them that avenue through free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=322.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=325.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They imposed a rule to shut me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=329.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=332.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=337.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that school kid member said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=339.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=345.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=348.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=351.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=362.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take the $5 million out of free cash,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=366.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=378.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=391.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like the drama behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=394.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question eight's intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=396.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=397.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=399.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed, fix the school schedule at the level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=420.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't that sound expensive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=422.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=423.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe what it is, Roy, you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=435.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're asking for, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=440.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=446.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, what we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=449.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is nothing close to $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=452.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=453.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=456.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the trend here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=459.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six, we heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=460.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seven and eight, education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=463.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand every single community that has fought for an override in their communities has used what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=471.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the children, and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=474.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=478.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I asked my colleagues, and we've heard people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=493.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were there, and you still have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=498.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=501.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=506.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share it with your friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=512.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=519.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want it, never.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=521.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=525.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=527.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=531.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=534.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=537.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=545.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't divide the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=548.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what has happened now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=550.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're dividing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=552.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=553.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=556.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=565.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=569.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=579.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=582.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for those who don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=586.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick step-by-step so you understand it's never quick with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=591.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=596.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caraviello was there, Council President Beas was there, and we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=610.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's too dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=612.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we were all for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=616.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Caraviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're gonna vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=630.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=631.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What agreement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=634.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know what agreement it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=635.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=640.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=644.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A financial task force was created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=649.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A school kid member, two city Councilors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=657.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five people with no background in financial battles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=664.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=666.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=672.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=673.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force is meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=675.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=676.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=677.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=679.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're told we're going to get in a meeting before we do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=684.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=688.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have our city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=691.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was the week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart red<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=700.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=708.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means devastation for the school department and our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=714.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=716.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=723.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use our free cash, let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=729.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=735.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=738.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=739.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Scarpelli shut down, can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=746.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is how we're getting messages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=748.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=752.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was what they came out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=754.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=756.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=757.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who was involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=758.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=761.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=765.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=767.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=769.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all on tape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=774.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=785.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=789.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=802.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but our council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=819.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done, you can't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=820.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=828.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=830.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess what that, that's free, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=834.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=841.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't wanna talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=842.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=844.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move on to the next meeting and I said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=846.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=850.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can I do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=851.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=852.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=859.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=863.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we get to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=866.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our leadership team does the same exact thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=869.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Suspends the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=871.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imposed, says they cannot impose rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=874.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then invoke section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=879.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council leadership says, no, you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=884.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Against the rule, against the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=888.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what was gonna be said is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=893.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=897.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Curtatone was at a crossroads with his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=905.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Big cuts looming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=907.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=920.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had the Sloans from Century Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=925.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had his financial team present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=928.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=932.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=938.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, how do we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=942.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=945.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=948.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two, how do we fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=951.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how does this never happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=955.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we were taught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=958.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=961.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=963.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=965.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to increase those fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=967.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=973.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=974.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Need taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=976.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=978.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=980.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we figure that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=982.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=988.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=989.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Developers pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=992.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=998.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we bring Somerville out of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1001.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1006.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1012.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1016.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1017.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is, that was an open process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1021.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1027.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1035.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1038.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1050.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1056.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1059.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1061.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1070.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caraviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1075.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1077.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1081.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1083.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1087.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scarpelli shouldn't be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1091.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1092.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't give a shit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1098.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to fight for what I think is right so every citizen is heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1102.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this, or I wouldn't do this, or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1110.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were three former Councilors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Aleesha Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1134.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1136.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1139.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1141.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Senior citizens are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1145.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1154.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1158.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could swallow that, couldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1160.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was with the process that gets started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1162.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1166.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1168.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1170.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1177.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1180.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this meeting tonight is so important, this fundraiser's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1184.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1188.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The restaurants that donated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1190.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's always donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1197.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1201.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1209.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess where that money's coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1212.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1214.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1219.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1225.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has $8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1231.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, God, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1234.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1241.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1255.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bullshit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1258.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money, but some of the people I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1269.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1272.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Mrs. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1274.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, George, help me understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1277.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1281.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So $48,000, I believe she said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1283.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I tell people $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1286.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now my house is worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1290.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My husband died 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1292.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a seamstress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1294.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My social security doesn't cover my taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1298.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So should I move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1300.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some people want them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1302.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1306.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1311.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1318.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1320.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1326.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Devastating for a resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1329.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not candy coating anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1332.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not hiding anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1333.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything you see has been public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1337.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1343.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see the information how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1346.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1348.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1350.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, it's only this much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1353.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1356.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because understand this, and I'll end with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1360.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1363.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1365.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1368.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a registry fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1370.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we talked about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1376.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it stops there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1377.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1379.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1385.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An additional $400 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1389.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, he's a young man, works very hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1392.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully, he can recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1395.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1406.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Kelly, what are we hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1407.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2025, you're gonna get the sales data for 2023, because the peak of the real estate market will pass your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1419.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1421.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have we heard any of that in their homework?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1424.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1426.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's only $400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1428.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's go a step further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1432.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A minimum $200 million renovated high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1437.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who fits that bill?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1439.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1441.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1443.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1444.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take it down to one new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1446.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looking at $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1449.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You people don't understand what that number equates to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1454.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1456.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary and it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1460.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1465.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group never wanted to say no to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1469.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1476.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1488.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1494.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't build something just to check a box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1498.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1501.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1503.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if they're saying it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1506.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've spelt it out for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1509.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very simple process right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1514.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fix the budget with $5 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1518.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1521.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1526.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something we haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1527.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I lying, Ricky?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1531.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many 40B jobs did we lose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1533.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1538.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1539.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tax revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1541.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done the homework on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1542.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $16 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1544.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these aren't lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1546.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are true numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1547.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, you wish you had a platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1562.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've been shut up way too easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1565.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in this forum, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1566.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're my voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1567.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're helping us spread the message now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1570.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1572.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1576.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1580.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have captains that are going to be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1586.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1591.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1598.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1610.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1613.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If a school kid member knocks on your door, it's a shame on you beyond that you have the information right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1620.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: beyond that you know the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1626.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1636.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's going to hurt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1645.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1652.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1655.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect, and we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1663.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1670.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They pay $2,400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pretty cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1676.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1677.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He will not raise that rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1680.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1689.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be passed down to the tenants, and renters are going to go through the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1696.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1700.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did I miss anything, Rick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1701.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1702.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1703.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick's going to tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1705.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, again, I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1707.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got great people working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1709.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for the energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1712.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1716.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Steve's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1717.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1723.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1730.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And show your neighbors and just give us a call, just so people know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1735.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1737.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you vote for an override and we give the mayor $6 million, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1753.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1758.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so again, there's a reason why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1763.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $9 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1768.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1770.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that want to know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1784.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1790.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1792.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1798.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring them out, have them know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1801.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1807.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Formell Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1814.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1818.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1820.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1828.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1841.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you all for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1843.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have a safe ride home and we'll talk to you soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=65.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=124.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=253.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=255.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=256.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there anybody from the administration available to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=262.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff or someone else from the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=276.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=277.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one question that I was informed by another city department that they were told that they needed to stop their negotiations because of fear of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=292.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the outcome of the override so they didn't want to commit, I believe, to move forward with any issues with funding moving forward until they know what happens in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=306.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm a little curious if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=310.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we should look at, I know there are some issues that we see that are on here now that I wouldn't object to because I know it's time sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=322.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's something that's really needed, I think we should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=325.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if there are concerns with the override vote and funding moving forward, that they're holding off negotiations, then I think it's something we need to talk about, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=340.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1384.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1386.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Randazzo again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1387.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1389.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh, you are your, um, history and saving money for our community is second to none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1397.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that everyone should realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1400.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my question is, along with this, I've I've gotten many phone calls from the business district, and I know what some of the changes in parking in Medford Square that the discussion has been that there's going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1414.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the parking for the business community, um, on, um, on Salem Street next to that parking lot next to the I believe it's a national grid building their substation building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1428.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the concerns that the businesses has that there is no lighting in that lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1434.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that been discussed by any chance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1436.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we are office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1476.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1624.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1627.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A question on that topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1632.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the elevator still currently out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1654.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I bring this up because last night we had a very important meeting and I think everybody unanimously decided that having a community meeting with our senior citizens that we're having some confusion on what the debt exclusion and the override questions were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1672.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I get had a few phone calls today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1675.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh from uh representing people that are representing that uh our senior citizens and they were very concerned that uh will the elevators be functioning on october 15th and if not i think we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1690.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: seriously consider moving that committee to the whole meeting to a location where senior citizens can attend that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1699.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it defeats the purpose of what we agreed on yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1703.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have people that can't climb stairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1706.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the 15th something that can work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1740.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we can, if we just have the clerk, if we can, as soon as Mr. Riggi gets us an update, if we can update the council with that, that'd be greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1751.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1892.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Forgive me, that's a late hand Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1990.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1993.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's not the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1997.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was, uh, was talking to someone from the negotiating team from our method police department and they were told during negotiations, I believe that negotiations will be delayed, um, for the fact that the override, um, might be in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2013.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So because of that fact that we need to, um, hold off until we get more understanding or, or see what the vote would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2022.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2025.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in November to move forward with their negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2028.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, the second part of that question is that if that is an issue, um, I'm under the impression that, uh, there's a negotiating line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2039.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if if that's not the case, could you educate me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2043.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there is a case that that it is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2047.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if you can let us know what we are with that as well because in my in my capacity when there's negotiations there's understanding that most municipalities have a negotiated line item that has funding already set aside and if we're holding that out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2068.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because of fear that the override will not move forward and needing that funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2075.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be construed of maybe as a fair tactic if the administration is moving in a for yes vote or it then leaves me a little befuddled if we don't have a line item when we negotiate with our union members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2092.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2144.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2147.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, just with that, though, I just, I think it is a direct correlation of what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2153.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2154.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that is, and we do find that until until we get to our next regular meeting, where we will vote on these, these initiatives, I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2164.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding that if we're looking at, and this is the case, if you do find research and they do come back and says, no, we did mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2175.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that's the case, then it's relevant for tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2181.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that if we do have questions about our financial question marks after the override and where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2191.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're talking we're we're discussing this with a negotiating team then i think that everything has to be on the table when the mayor presents any sort of funding for anything right now um like i said there are things that are presented today that when it comes to a vote i i don't think i can hesitate because i think it's needed but there are some other things that we can look at and say hey i would like i would motion to sever and then look at the different options because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2218.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh the need of funding if that's the case moving forward so i think there's a direct correlation of what i was told and what is on the agenda tonight so thank you mr president and thank you chief of staff nazarian thank you and thank you for being here councillor Leming um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2267.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: yeah i apologize i just want to make sure if it's if i'm confusing councillor uh Leming i can clarify if he wants um the confusion is if there is an issue that's dealing with our city financial concerns and and one group or one situation is being um frozen for uh the the fear of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2291.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: lack of funding later on in November, then this would be a concern moving any money doctor to the next level, considering if there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2305.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some fear and I appreciate the chief of staff looking into it and hoping it's just a rumor, but I got it from a credible source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2314.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's actually part of the negotiating team that said that that did happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2318.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to see maybe, maybe there's some misunderstanding there and get some corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2323.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you're confused with that, I can clear it up if you have any questions for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2397.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2401.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I understand that we have, we have, we, we can, we can respect, excuse me, we can, we can agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2411.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think it's important that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2415.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if it does come to a climate when we need to petition to move funding around from different accounts, there are mechanisms that we could do that depending on what accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2426.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would say everything would be open until we understand the true financial picture on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2433.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2646.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you have, I just got a text message, Mr. Clerk, that maybe I'm out of line, but there's people trying to get on the Zoom that had questions with that response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2657.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like I said, I will move this forward and with a yes vote until we get more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2665.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2667.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2668.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, oh yeah, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2673.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no, it's Harold McGilvrey, the negotiating from the police department wanted to get on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2680.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2681.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it would be yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2741.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. Clerk, did you call my name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2745.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, I'd say no, I wanna hear more of what Council President is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2751.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't worry about his percentages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=61.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=64.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, I was talking to Councilor Villes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=70.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked knows my fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=72.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, is that Mr?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=75.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=77.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we just recently lost another pillar of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=82.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A gentleman that, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=84.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: gave to the youth of Medford as a hockey coach and always happened to go to his services the other days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=94.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's Mr. John Garrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=96.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Garrity was one of my favorite parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=101.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His son Jay was my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=102.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His son Chris played for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=107.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was always willing to help, never a negative word, whether he thought I played his kid too much or too little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=114.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just a good sounding boy, a Method legend in his own right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=120.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listened to some stories the other day and hearing the stories on the playground and on the ice and playing pond hockey really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=133.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: summed it up what kind of person Mr. Garrity was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=135.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was a tenacious individual who loved life, loved Medford, and loved his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=142.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that with the passing of his son, Jay, I know it was very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=149.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Jay was a very big piece in a lot of people's lives, but I'm sure when a dad loses his first son, I think it must have played,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=159.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very big part in who he was after that and I know that he was a rock for his wife and I know that Mrs. Garrity is one of the leaders in our community in making sure that we don't forget the issues of drug addiction and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=182.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Garrity family really keeps that on the front page and making sure that they're solid advocates for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=190.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we did unexpectedly lose Mr. Garrity a few weeks ago and just wanted to send our condolences to the Garrity family and he will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=203.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=382.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello and Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=384.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that another great family metric, not just a camera store, but Hunt Drug now, if you wanted lessons, if you wanted to do different trade shows, the farmers are always willing to even come into the community to run programs for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=405.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=406.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, with, you know, Gary and I coach, I was fortunate enough to coach a great athlete in Gary Fava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=413.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think he's missed a three point shot to this day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=416.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Larry Bird's the only person that rivals him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=419.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, it is an amazing story of a local family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=423.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that have done amazing things, but what I really am impressed about is how they always give back, whether it be the veterans or school programming, and it's something that they never forgot their roots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=436.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to congratulate them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=437.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1688.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1933.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As such, move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1936.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1987.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll present if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1991.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are projects that are already in place, and these are just the additions to finishing projects, something that's why we voted for the CPA, the great project, so move forward to approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3403.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Madam Mayor, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3407.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what you're doing is unbelievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3411.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're doing right now is a good example for the rest of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3414.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have to have a task force, just people caring about the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3417.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to hear that about, you know, Emory Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3419.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's people that are reaching out to us that unfortunately we don't have the court enforcement department we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3425.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3426.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5189.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a few different issues when it comes to our handicapped community and the lack of respect, whether they were having a city event and they're blocking handicap ramps or issues like what we're hearing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5204.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I know that the, I know that Neil Osborne used to have the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5217.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is so frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5218.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anybody can we actually make a motion to send that to Francis as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5222.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is an issue to with the Disability Act that it's not just the T issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5228.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not, you know, a situation with with, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5234.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, Todd Blake, but this is also something that legally that the city has to get involved in, and we can send, you know, our enforcement agency to look at that as soon as possible to see if something could be remedied sooner rather than later, because if we wait for the T, they'll be building a blue line going through Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5256.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could do that, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5260.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5815.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5819.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to say it, but I'm going to say it, but I told you so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5824.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an opportunity this budget season to hold the mayor's feet to the fire, and we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5830.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The answer to Councilor Tseng's resolution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5833.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called a city solicitor, an assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5839.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's unheard of in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5842.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city of this size, not having a team of city solicitors representing the residents, the council, of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5856.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're finally getting some redacted bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5860.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was last month, maybe you can correct me, I believe it was over $100,000 K.P.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5866.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5866.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe this month, last month that we just got, a slow month,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5871.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was another $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5872.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5876.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is money we're paying to a law firm that doesn't have to answer to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5885.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5886.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are basic necessities we need that every city needs to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5895.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even tonight, some of the resolutions we're going through, we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5898.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm afraid to open my mouth because we have no legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5903.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because one one of our residents came up and said, Well, you're starting to pick on people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5908.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't disagree with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5910.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that we don't have legal guidance to say careful how you say this, because you could be sued, because that's happened to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5919.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we not forget that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5922.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're still in court with it with the BJ situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5926.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5930.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5932.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, for the neighbors, what's going on in that neighborhood is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5937.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, again, the fact that we don't have code enforcement officers is another big issue, but we wouldn't know that because we couldn't discuss these issues at the budget hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5955.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the mayor got what she needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5958.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She got her four votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5961.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now here we are again, bringing up these same things and sounding like a broken record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5966.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I will tell you, I, on the school committee, we realized we had the toughest mayor that negotiates in years, and Mike McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5978.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we needed things done for our school department, the school committee stood together and would not vote a budget until we got what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5990.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know people don't like to hear this, but that's politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5994.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the whole gamut of why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6000.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This mayor is doing whatever she wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6004.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see any benefit for our community, whether it's neighbors with Airbnbs, or whether it's a simple question that people, no one's picking up the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6017.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm frustrated, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6019.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not as animated, because I think I'm getting tired of being so animated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6023.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is a very simple issue, very simple solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6028.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hire a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6032.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hire an assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6038.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In most communities, that's like saying, breathe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6044.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7035.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7037.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's time to maybe make a motion that we become a little creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7042.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that working with the building department, the inspectional service department, maybe working with the unions, maybe we ask the city administration and the mayor to sit down with those unions like they do with the police department and bring in retired police officers and maybe pay them to actively<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7063.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to go out and do, you know, assist with the code enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7069.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, especially with our retired police officers, I think that might be an opportunity that we can think outside the box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7077.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, other communities use grant writers, bringing in grant writers and use grants that they would write to bring in money to our community and pay them through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7089.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe there's an avenue there that they, you know, having some incentive that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7093.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can, you know, do a few things at once where we're sending more people out, qualified people out, to understand our code enforcement and start, like our neighbor said, is start policing it better and giving them the avenues that we haven't given them at budget time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7118.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to make that form of motion that we ask the mayor administration to look into that process to try to immediately enhance the code enforcement office, both with the health department and the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7549.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, I think anybody that can be trained for that, Councilor Knight, that works with the union and the code enforcement department right now that can do something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7560.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can assist with these concerns and issues so we get ahead of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7981.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could amend that too, Councilor Knight brought up a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7985.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Per diem payments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7990.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to assist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7993.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, if you can add that to that amendment to that B paper that add that or either word it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8003.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8003.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8007.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As she's been doing, as the mayor has been doing multiple times in multiple positions in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8012.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8950.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President, I appreciate bringing this forward as a strong union supporter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8956.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support anything dealing with unions, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8962.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would be remiss if I didn't bring up the fact that we're talking about, we're talking about RAs from Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8969.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I recall back, we talked about our own unions being affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8975.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and Councilors that are sitting here talking about the effect that it had, you know, on the process of moving forward on a nonunion contract is because maybe we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8988.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to help things going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8990.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember those conversations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8992.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a fire department that hasn't had a contract in almost 800 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8997.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have secretaries that didn't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9000.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a contract for six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9001.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about the RAs at Tufts University, a contact at Tufts University today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9006.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boy, I tell you what, correct me if I'm wrong, free room and board, free meals plan, stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9016.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I talked today with the representative of Tufts University, that's what they told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9020.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to say, I'm just sharing to you what they've told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9024.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just, and you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9026.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'm saying is this, understanding that, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna vote for this because I think any union, any person that wants to work together as a union and have representation, you can never deny it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9042.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just want you to realize and understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9044.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a good point to bring it forward that we have unions right now in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9049.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My father always told me, don't worry about your neighbor's backyard till you clean your own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9054.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 800 days, 800 days without a contract for a firemen and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9059.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They sat through the pandemic, the first ones they applauded how great they were, how amazing what they've done for our community, going into the homes where people are dying and putting their lives first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9072.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm using this, yes, I'm using it as a platform that I hope you understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9077.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's for the fact that we have unions in our own community right now in Medford, hardworking men and women residents that live here all year round that haven't been treated fairly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9091.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, two wrongs don't make a right, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9093.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9095.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a very important paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9097.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I share what the representative from Tufts University told me today, so we can all understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9104.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the difficult part about negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9106.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You hear what you want to hear, what they want to say, to make it sound good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9110.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But who's affected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9111.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the employee, the worker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9114.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I think we need to look at our firefighters, because I think, listen, unified message next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9121.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can this mayor do to support our firefighters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9126.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Update us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9128.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the negotiations now are now in arbitration, it's out of our hands, but what else can we do for our firefighters that we're showing them the unity, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9140.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That they're standing together and saying, what are you gonna do for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9145.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=32.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=614.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=615.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=616.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what my sentiments were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=618.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the biggest concern we had when this came in front of this body is that, especially at the time during the pandemic, we were seeing the effects, the negative effects with what was happening in our country affecting our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=636.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we continue to work out of the pandemic, and here we are, we're finally safe, hopefully,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=645.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing businesses thriving, especially in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=648.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the number one goal is not to allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=654.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the food trucks other than what we stipulated in the guidelines that Council Bears expressed that it was for special events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=664.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, but the concern was that there are special events that come up and sometimes the council won't meet and it leaves organizations in limbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=674.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's giving the right to city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=678.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the Board of Health to give that permission and take it off the City Council plate for those purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=687.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want anybody to miss out on an opportunity, but at the same time, my number one goal from the beginning was protecting our brick and mortar businesses, especially in the climate that we're in right now here in Medford, where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=703.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we have, we need to keep and what we need to grow on the brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=710.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're bringing in food trucks from outside the city and allowing these organizations to roll up, we're going to really taint what we're looking for, and especially most of our squares and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=729.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and bringing more solid businesses to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=734.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I agree with Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=736.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we agreed on a good plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=740.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for their purposes of making sure that no one is left behind, but at the same time, still protecting the brick and mortar businesses and not allowing the full-time or a specialized area that some communities do have that maybe their businesses thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=756.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until I see our brick and mortar businesses thriving and people rushing to come to Medford and opening restaurants, I would hate to give a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=766.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a food truck provision to come and go as they may please and take business away from what we need to grow in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=774.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=942.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I know other communities use, I can understand that too, but so leaving the permitting process with the health department to make sure that we follow those guidelines, but taking it away from the council to make sure that it's a more streamlined process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=960.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=962.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: communities use the communications department that does all the special events for the city, or even the parks and recreations director, and allowing that purview under the guidelines that we've given them, that's pretty simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=981.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=984.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Board of Health doesn't want to do that because it's out of their purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=986.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=988.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have other departments in the city that perform permitting processes that, given the guidelines of our ordinance, I think this shouldn't be a heavy lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=999.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have multiple departments here that we can delegate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1005.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the permanent process to if that's the only issue, I don't see why we can't just put that on the city administration to appoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1015.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the best practice that they follow, because they run road races, they run special events, they do parades, they do walks around City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1024.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't perform those permits, someone that does that in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1028.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend, Madam President, that this question be given to the administration to pinpoint the department and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1040.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: allow that department to follow through with the permitting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1044.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1045.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1152.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1155.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can this, we're making this very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1158.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one day special permits for special events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1161.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1163.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not special events four days in a row, unless<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1166.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city that allows a permit if they had, let's say per se, a carnival in the city that lasted two or three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1173.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're just protecting the long-term permitting process of a food truck anywhere in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1183.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already decided we're against that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1185.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're protecting our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1187.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know, this isn't a heavy lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1190.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To me, it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1192.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The permitting process goes to the administration to assign someone to do that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1196.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Health department assigns that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1198.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's something that we didn't put in the ordinance that says that it has to be in a private, in a public way, then we can adjust that, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1208.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other than that, I think it's that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1211.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want food trucks in a designated area anywhere, at least for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1217.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at least this council does, I'm speaking for myself, but until we have security and growth in our business community, allowing food trucks is only gonna hurt that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1231.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my philosophy, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1992.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1995.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just as a resolution, I think, can we, I'll be asking this moving forward, that can we also have a report of the billable hours from KP Law to address situations like this to the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2012.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to be asking that moving forward until we have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2021.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This this is a type of ordinance that is done within days in the in city halls all over this Commonwealth with the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2031.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2033.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: nothing personal, I just need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2036.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Moving on, this is gonna be a common cry from Councilor Scarpelli till we see a city solicitor, that we get a report back of how many billable hours it'll take KP Law to address these concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2049.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2072.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, here's what I've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2074.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, the council, the health director, the interim economic development director, any departments, the administration, if necessary, come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2556.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Baird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2589.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=673.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=673.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Dasch, I know that one of the questions that was brought forth was the turnaround for the fire truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=678.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a big issue, but that was resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=680.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=681.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think the biggest issue is really moving this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=684.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that I believe what the family had mentioned at the beginning, that it was a hardship due to a family member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=691.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=692.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=695.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my fellow counsel is going to table it, so he allowed me to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=700.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move it on the vote, but obviously I don't think it will have the vote, so I just think that we have a new council coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=710.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we can bring them up to speed and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=715.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hope for the first meeting in January we get this passed, because this is, I still don't, I don't see why it's an issue that we can't move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=723.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it seems like in good faith, we're, we're, we're going above and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=727.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I look at this in a sense that we're kind of holding the Alps hostage here, in a sense that we're, you know, what we're asking them to do, we're going above and beyond right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=738.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like the city has really, really just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=743.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: waste a lot of people's time not getting the answers to the right people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=747.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To hear the fact the mayor hasn't even seen this yet is a little bothersome to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=751.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That to me is just, you know, no disrespect in any way, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=756.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: attorneys are expensive, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=758.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everybody has to make a living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=761.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're talking about amount of time that's being spent by the Alice family to try to get this push forward for a good reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=767.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in even having the open dialogue and doing something that I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't, you know, allow myself to sort of be bullied to try to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=779.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This should be something our community should be looking to assist each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=783.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=785.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, I just I'm a little confused why we can't move this forward in the sense of a time sensitive situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=791.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but I'll leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=794.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1614.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1615.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Council Vice President would entertain, could we add something to the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1624.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to get the attendance record for all of the members on the Election Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1629.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1630.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1632.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, from what I gather, we don't have too many members that are actually committed to that commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1638.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think we're taking it as serious as we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1641.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My biggest piece with this situation is accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1645.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen very, very good people be marched out that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1649.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But not even a quarter of the concerns that we've we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1658.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or understand any process that has gone on is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1665.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard from one commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1667.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard from anybody except for the coordinator who sent us a message saying that the election is now certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1679.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like Councilor Caraviello said, my biggest problem is when I was a young man, when I was in high school, everybody had a mandatory class called civics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1693.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you learned about our government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1694.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You learned about the respect you should give this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1702.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still remember my son just left a minute ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1704.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about how Mrs. Lasky ran the fourth grade presidential election in her classroom and how important everything was and how organized everything should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1716.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish Mrs. Lasky ran this last election because Councilor Caraviello again is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1722.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When people don't want to vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1724.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: good people, good hardworking people that took pride in coming to that ballot box every municipal election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1733.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've looked me in the eye and said, they'll never vote again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1736.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have no faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1738.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I truly thought that maybe coming out ahead of this could have helped that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1744.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But instead, we just fed into the rhetoric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1747.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said it the day that we had the first issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1749.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1750.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1752.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because perception is reality and it's exactly what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1759.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So moving forward, I know that we'll have a new council, but I think as this council looks to move people forward and look at our budgetary processes, we have to start looking for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1773.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the city administration is not going to hold people accountable, then we're going to have to make sure that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1778.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they know that this council is going to be strong enough to make sure they hold their people to the feet of the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1784.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this has been an absolute laughingstock across the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1790.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact, I'll be honest with you, I'm disgusted with the Secretary of State's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1797.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Reached out to them, haven't heard anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1802.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what they're all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1804.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is what the Secretary of State and our governor sees that that's appropriate, look what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1812.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a trickle-down effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1813.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, who knows how many people aren't going to come out for the next elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1819.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1820.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told us anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1821.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's even talked to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1823.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a bunch of fluffy, I'm getting a lot of emails, fluffy emails, you know, wishing me luck, a happy birthday, a congratulations, but no one is still from that commission's talked to me about, George, this is what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1838.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1842.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then for the recount, I know I wasn't there, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1847.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to a few people that came here, gave their time to help with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1853.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I heard our coordinator, our elections coordinator was verbally getting in people's faces and disrespecting people to the point where the attorney from the from the candidate side had to step in and say, Please do not address any of our people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1872.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Talk to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1874.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1878.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot more that's going to go on in that meeting when they come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1882.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my biggest thing right now is, and a lot of people that have talked to him on every side, every side, this isn't just, you know, the George Scarpelli side, this is every side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1893.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's watching to see where the accountability pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1898.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what everybody's waiting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1901.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you want to give them benefit of the doubt until the January 29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1904.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1907.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you're gonna come up to that podium on January 29th and give us fluff, be prepared, because this one Councilor is gonna ask some serious questions, and I'm gonna be calling people out directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1922.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President, and I rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2615.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says, temporary shelter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2616.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hello, representatives, senators, members of Medford City Council, Medford School Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2620.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to give you all a heads up on an ever-evolving matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2624.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the end of last week, I was informed that 400 Riverside Ave was being explored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2629.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a possible temporary winter emergency shelter for migrant families on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2634.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state was only going to pick one site from my recollection on a phone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2640.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The families would only each stay a few nights before they would be transitioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2645.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The shelter was going to run through April and start with those families currently staying at 10 Park Plaza and may build up to no more than 75 families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2656.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state, excuse me, 75, the state asked for a walkthrough today, and at the time, the Commissioner Rice relayed different terms to us, all regarding capacity and length of stay through June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2669.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He also said that this was the site they plan to try to move forward with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2674.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have another call with the state tomorrow to try to get more clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2679.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is 110,000 square foot site that meets the needs of the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2684.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm worried about the burden it will cause with city staff, the school department, and et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2690.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It reaches the capacity that we are unable to handle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2694.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will follow up with you when we have more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2697.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was on 12-5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2699.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is, I thought this was public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2702.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2703.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know that no one else knew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2705.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the first time that I heard that no one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2706.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I'm sorry, I don't have Facebook, but yeah, this isn't Facebook, but I would assume diagonally across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2711.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I would assume we should have a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2714.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should call for a community meeting immediately, maybe somewhere in that area that we can let our neighbors know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2721.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because from what I gather, it doesn't sound like the mayor's supporting this either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2726.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if this is something on the state level, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2730.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the biggest thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2732.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I heard this, I talked to a couple of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2736.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they were confused because they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2739.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the increase in numbers in the elementary school, especially kindergarten level, I guess they've added an extra kindergarten to every single school already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2747.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there was some thought that we've already let families in, and that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2753.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if that isn't the issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2754.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fear from our educators that any influx, now remember, anybody that moves into our community as a child, they have every right to go to school in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2766.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is gonna put a huge burden, a burden that I don't think that can meet the capacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2771.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we offer right now, both at the McGlynn and the Roberts for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2775.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if the other schools have space from what I was told that there aren't many places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2781.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, the other issue we heard was with the closure of the Salem Street Fire Station back in our area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2789.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say our area because we grew up in North Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2791.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The idea of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2793.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: any more an influx of this magnitude with only one true station that's on that side, really, other than coming from the main station and then the heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2804.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really going to play an impact with public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2807.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of issues here that I appreciate you bringing this forward today because I think that it's scary at many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2815.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, like I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2818.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when I gather the mayor is really confused with this whole situation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2822.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not to support her in any way and understanding it, but this is something that one thing we should do is have community meeting or something should go out saying what she just said in this email that I personally thought because this is a public record, I thought it was already out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2840.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2841.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2842.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish I knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2911.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why it's an issue, because I took that as that they changed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2918.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The original phone call was for temporary, and then it was extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2922.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm looking at it totally different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2924.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's why, I think having some clarity, I think that's why really just having some clarity from the main office I think would be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3285.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3287.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's difficult for me because when you spend so much time in people, it's not just every other Tuesday now, or it was every Tuesday, but my first two phone calls on the way to work every morning was to Councilor Caraviello, then to Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3310.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I want to applaud you, Rick, is for teaching all of us to understand why we do what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3319.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think people have forgotten that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3321.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think last meeting was a pretty good indication of where we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3327.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick Caraviello, the Rick Caraviello I know, no one understands how much you've done for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3337.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's great about a person that does things, hey, listen, it's great when the camera's in your face, people taking pictures of people talking about you, and you're standing up and shaking hands and cutting ribbon, because I know a lot of people that do that and love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3349.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's all ego-driven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3351.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the Rick Caraviello I know, that I'm honored to call my friend, has always done things behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3358.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've always admired that about you, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3361.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've tried to emulate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3363.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very difficult to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3366.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: while running a family and running a business and taking care of dad that's in a home and understanding everything that goes on in a person's life, you still have time to feed the hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3383.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You still have time to build a deck for a person that can't afford a handicap ramp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3391.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When a veteran needs something, it's Rick Caraviello they call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3397.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I used to be, to be honest, I was so jealous of how you did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3402.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, but it also made me proud that I've learned from the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3408.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've sat behind this rail with some amazing people, some amazing people that when I sit and talk about all these different people than our lifetimes that have lost, we've lost, and they've moved on to the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3422.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the big Mustang land in the sky, I look at it and I say, who's going to take that place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3429.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was fortunate because I see people like Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco and Councilor Knight and you being the Mount Rushmore of that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3451.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to get emotional because I think that this is more than just you've given enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3456.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Zach is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3458.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it came, when you saw the city falling, no one else had the guts to stand up and you stood up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3466.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You stood up taller than any man I've ever seen in my life other than my dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3474.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't hide from anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3475.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You fought every single day to make things right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3482.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm honored to be your friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3484.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope I can make those phone calls in the morning still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3490.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sometimes I think Dina gets jealous because I don't pick up her call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3495.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'd say, I'm on the phone with Carvey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3499.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But she knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3500.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for your family, people that I love, Carol, you've been amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3507.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure Rick is here with us, and I don't think he's ever missed a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3512.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I missed a meeting, I'd always get an email, a text message right away saying, where are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3517.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I felt guilty to say, my God, Rick, I'm stuck at work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3520.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no matter what, even after the election, he was still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3523.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even after the election, people are still calling him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3525.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was at the door the other day, and I was like, after the election, and I said, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3533.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He had a truck full of turkeys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3535.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, do you know anybody who needs a turkey, any family that needs a turkey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3540.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3541.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're going to miss in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3543.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People don't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3544.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that when I see your grandchildren, I make sure they know how proud they should be of their papa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3552.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Rick, you've done an amazing job to set a standard for the Caraviello family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3557.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my friend, all I can say to you is I wish one day George Scarpelli leaves a legacy like Rick Caraviello, because it's not Armin anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3568.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Armin did was win a few football games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3571.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick Caraviello is what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3575.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we should all aspire to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3577.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will miss you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3579.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everything you've taught me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3581.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've appreciated you, the phone calls that you've, you've called me and set me straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3586.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was going to go stray, you pulled me back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3589.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope I still get those phone calls because we know it's not going to be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3594.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Zach Beers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3596.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine Ricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3602.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Joking, of course, but I love you, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3605.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm proud that this journey in our lives made us brothers and I thank you and I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3614.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3615.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5406.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think that it's tough when it's one person that leaves, but when it's two, it's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5419.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5419.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5421.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Someone that I've worked with, I mean, for a long time now, so I apologize, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5428.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Believe me, I have your speech ready, so I hope you have tissues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5434.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love listening to kid laugh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5437.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you ever notice that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5438.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's my mission in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5440.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it's my mission in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5441.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just want everybody to realize, I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5449.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might not agree with him a thousand percent of the time you might get irritated with him Sometimes he does it with a subtle rule or a law, but sometimes he does it with a kick in the face but he does it all for a reason and something that I admire and His passion and love for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5473.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's a common denominator tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5476.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5478.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello touched on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5482.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is probably the smartest person I've ever been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5486.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would call him so giddy about something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5488.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5489.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd say, Adam, how about this rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5492.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or how about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5493.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he'd say, no, that's good, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5495.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But how about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5496.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, I was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5499.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he wouldn't tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5502.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or it would be like, I have to do this, Adam, could you, I sent over a speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5507.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And 15 minutes later, I'd get something back and say, wow, that's great, but that's nothing of what I sent you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5514.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's, when I first started running for school committee, one of the first phone calls I made was to a young man named Adam Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5524.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5527.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he helped,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5528.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mold that team that started my journey as an elected official more than 16 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5536.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I admire your passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5540.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I admire your, what people don't realize is your strong integrity and for what's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5548.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that we laugh about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5550.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to lie to you, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5552.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last couple of months, we've had a few jokes behind your back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5555.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, people don't realize, when he first got angry because somebody moved all of his paperwork, people don't realize that's years, years of organizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5570.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if Adam needed anything, if I said something, and I'm like, geez, I don't know where to look for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5573.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd look at Adam, and he would know exactly out of a mound of pile of paperwork that he knew exactly where to go to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5580.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he probably still has it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5584.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5585.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that knowing the Knight family, and I was fortunate to know his dad and know his beautiful wife and his kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5595.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think this is good for Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5597.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the last year that he had has been very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5601.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's been true to what you're supposed to be and what we should all admire too as a family man that supported his brother through probably his most difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5611.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, you know, I wish people would know what you've gone through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5618.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, but as a friend, like I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5622.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my first phone call, then my second phone call to get whether your approval or your understanding or you correcting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5631.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5632.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, there's a common denominator tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5637.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sad because I'm not going to see you on a regular basis, that we're going to be mandated to see each other at least every other Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5644.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm proud that we're friends and I'm proud that my kids<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5651.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: get to be around Adam Knight because he's a great role model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5655.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my daughter Gianna loves him and his family and I know John is at Merrimack and he's following Adam's footsteps out of Merrimack and I know how much Dina loves both you and Rick and what you guys have done for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5674.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna miss you my friend and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5677.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank this opportunity because I have a good friend that I feel I can count on for the rest of my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5685.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5738.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, all right, kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5757.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Buy the coffee, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7258.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I, uh, Councilor Morelle, I just, Council President, um, I'm honored to call you president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7266.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I've reached out to you some tough meetings and I wanted to, you know, publicly say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7274.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you've handled yourself with grace and honor, and I think you've been a true leader to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7279.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caraviello said, it's not easy when your community is viewed as divided, you know, the new metric, the old metric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7289.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would get phone calls, imagine this Morell, I said, imagine this Morell, imagine Nicole Morell would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7299.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: take an opportunity to stand up and run for an office that's not traditionally for an independent, strong woman, and come in and do what you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7310.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you because you give my daughter the understanding that you can reach for anything you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7319.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we haven't seen eye to eye to everything, but it was always out of respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7324.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what people don't understand is that it's for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7330.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Nicole Morell doesn't go home at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7332.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They tell people, yeah, but Nicole definitely goes home at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7335.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How can I destroy that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7338.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It became comical at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7340.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think you've stood up and you have taken the leadership with honor, with grace, with distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7350.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm proud that I've served with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7354.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the most honorable thing in life, I think I've, in my life that I've ever seen, is watch my wife raise our two amazing kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7364.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And tonight, it like kicked me like a mule watching you with your baby and understand the huge sacrifices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7373.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember the nights that you'd have to run out of here for 20 minutes and run back and people didn't know why, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7380.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your mom first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7382.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you taking this hiatus, I know that when everything moves forward like we expect and have a positive growth with your beautiful son, that you'll be back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7399.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we appreciate the four years that you've given us, and I appreciate you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7407.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being our leader and I think that I hope that we do see you around still and I'm sure that if you see me go the wrong way that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7418.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing people don't realize, I don't think, is how tough you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7421.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And George Scott Pell likes to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7425.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People think I yell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7426.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm yelling at people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7427.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't yell at people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7428.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how I speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7430.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ask my wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7430.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just talk loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7433.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's great because you give it right back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7436.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there was some things me and you would talk about right here, and you'd say, oh yeah?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7440.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you forget two years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7441.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, oh wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7443.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, ooh, ooh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7445.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's out of respect, and I appreciate that, because I think that's what this council is so great about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7452.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done some great things, and we've respected each other enough to agree to disagree, but not cross the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7461.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I thank you, and I wish you much luck and happiness at home, and enjoying your beautiful son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7472.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I'm sure we'll see you around, so I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7474.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=448.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=450.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what Amy's talking about is these positions were all voted by members of this council, not unanimously, but it was voted by members of this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=458.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what she's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1027.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Amy Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1029.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand your frustration, and but again this is the fundamental issues we're having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1035.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and society, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1036.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody wants to talk about supporting the union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1039.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds good, it looks good on your paraphernalia you're gonna mail out that you're supported or you're whatever for this, but I want you to realize, and I want my fellow councils to realize, this is something I've been saying from the beginning, any money paper that's come, unless it was urgent, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1058.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any vote for raises for non-union employees, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1062.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implored, I expressed that to my fellow Councilors and they passed, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1068.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1070.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I will tell you is the other issue that I see, it's pretty damaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1074.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look behind you, I don't see one male.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1078.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see one male employee that hasn't got when they need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1082.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this council in the past have talked about the rights of women and making sure there's equality here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1088.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see that either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1090.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's the thing, I'm not afraid either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1092.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived in this community my whole life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1095.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been an elected official since I left teaching in 2008.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1100.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not afraid to say what I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1103.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm sad for you is you're being used as a pawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1108.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unions are being used as a pawn, whether it's the lieutenant governor, whether it's the governor's office, whether it's state representatives or whether it's this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1117.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what can I tell you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1119.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't tell you anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1120.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going through horrible negotiations because nobody is standing up for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1124.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1125.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, I thought today, when I came here, I said, well, this is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1130.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about a council that have worked together pretty closely in the past year, making sure good initiatives get passed, even without any of the tools that were promised us last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1141.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the time, when we vote later, you're going to realize where you should focus on, where the city should focus on, where unions should focus on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1151.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'll be honest with you, if you keep giving and you keep giving, what is she gonna do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1158.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's gonna keep taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1159.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1161.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You say stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1163.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last year we said stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1165.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at least we were heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1169.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least we were heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1171.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the presentation later with the budget, I know Councilor Caraviello has worked extensively in putting some numbers together, that when I think that people hear it, and if anybody would vote for this budget after you hear these numbers, it'll be appalling for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1187.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I could tell you and your fellow colleagues that are getting the short end of the stick again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1195.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is all I could do is apologize from one city councilor to one department in the city that keeps us running every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1201.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize that you haven't even have to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1204.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1207.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is sad for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1272.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You wouldn't know what compound is because you weren't given a raise for six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1275.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that actually explained to you later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1276.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You wouldn't know that, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2307.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, I appreciate the time and I would just tell you know, everybody has their own opinions of what they have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2314.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too was a member of the negotiating team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2317.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a union members in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2319.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then battled for contracts for teachers as a city school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2326.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm on the negotiating team municipality, neighbor community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2329.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a union member, my parents have been union members their whole lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2333.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing we've always learned and we saw it play out right in front of us when the country was going to close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2339.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2340.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Each party stood strong until they figured out what was best for what their needs were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2345.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2347.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've all agreed behind this rail, that making sure fair labor practices, making sure that there's equitable, equitable pay when it comes to our non union or union employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2358.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said that every single time a vote came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2363.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we stood strong, Amy, my belief, if we stood strong on the no's all the way through,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2371.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then it comes to the position where we have to do the right thing for everybody or nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2375.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, this is why the city is so divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2378.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why morale, someone told me the other day when I mentioned it after I've talked to many different department heads, believe it or not, that morale here is terrible, and I can see why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2387.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all I can say is this, what my fellow councilors saying, they're not wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2393.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2394.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2396.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the power that we have today to vote yes and no for the contract, for the budget, just like we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2405.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just like we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2407.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we thought we won last year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2409.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We thought we finally got what we needed to make this body work better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2413.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2415.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one promise was fulfilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2416.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2419.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than what you're going through so this is going to be a very interesting evening tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2423.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the community will see where we stand as a, as a council, where we stand and where we want the city to go, because if it's, if it's going to be, you know, pick and choose, like, it's being done on the city side with non union and dividing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2439.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're gonna see that here, then we're in a bad state for the next few years here, if that's gonna be the case, that stays the trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2446.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize and I told you that, and I appreciate you for coming up, I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2452.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know what, they have to see the people that it hurts, because I don't think people see, that's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2458.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a newspaper, people don't see it every day, what they see is fluff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2463.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of people like to see the fluff and the happiness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2465.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they don't like to see is what's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2468.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You standing up there and saying there are people, there are ladies, women behind you that work hard for the city that are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2474.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I just want you to know, I know the president has given us more than enough time to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2481.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2482.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's nothing else we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2483.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2484.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2486.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3308.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3310.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3311.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris, again, I want to take the time to I know we expressed it as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3316.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to thank the Football Association and the high school football team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3319.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But whenever you think you guys are done, what I saw, what I saw and what I heard with the Kiwanians and feeding the, helping with the food insecurities and working together with Chelsea and making sure that again, Medford stood above it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3336.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I want to applaud the members of your team and the coach and staff for really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3344.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really looking at what being a high school athlete is truly all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3347.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, you know, if we looked at the wins and losses, that's, that's pretty small way of looking at this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3354.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the way that this football team, our football team brings so much pride to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3360.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for me personally, um, I just have to applaud the association coach Curly and his staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3366.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most importantly, the kids in that team, cause they, they really, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3372.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really standing above and showing what true superstars they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3376.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you very much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3581.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3583.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some tragic news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3586.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, when Chris brings up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3588.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people that have given to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3590.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a gentleman who kids grew up in Medford, coached his youngest son, watched Freddy Rita give back to the kids in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3606.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when people weren't supposed to give to this much time and effort for certain type of kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3615.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Freddie would go and find the kids that couldn't afford a pair of cleats, or a pair of shin guards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3621.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he would make sure that he would buy those cleats and buy those shin guards, and then he'd put them on a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3627.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when at the time there was, you know, this infighting with method you soccer, and some people thought that kids in need really weren't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3636.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: getting the attention they deserve, Freddie and some others, dedicated members of the community, decided to start a new league called Method United.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3645.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they did that, not because of ego, but to make sure every kid was represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3652.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3654.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened after a few years, that group then became, came together again as a true Method youth soccer organization that we see today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3663.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A true vision of what the demographic of what Method truly looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3672.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The canvas that is Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3674.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Freddie's love for the game of soccer and Freddie's passion to help kids was evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3683.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Freddie's a great story because I saw him a few weeks ago at a baseball game and we were talking and I didn't realize Freddie was an orphan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3693.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, there's no way that an orphan has the ability to raise such an amazing family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3699.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what he did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3700.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He raised amazing children and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3704.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His wife, Adele, is just one of the best people that I've ever met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3708.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, Freddy lost his life mowing his lawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3715.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that I know my family, myself, we're gonna miss Freddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3721.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was very special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3723.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we send our condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3725.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was one of the great ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3727.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4378.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4379.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4380.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4381.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Daniel, thank you for being a tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4383.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How was the participation with the, uh, in these meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4387.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have a lot of community input?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4389.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, is that something that's that was that that was different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4394.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, it was not as normal as usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4423.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not a big turnout of negatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7208.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I just have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7210.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7210.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know we can answer these questions, Miss Desmond, but I think that the points that were brought up that I want to bring forth as we move on, I think that we're, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7226.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: any community that has a reputable establishment like raising canes to come into community I think it's a plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7234.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also think that the most important pieces is understanding what the neighbors that really about that location, and how that affects them and I think that that's why these are the questions that I have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7247.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I've gone back and forth with different neighbors, and they've called me back and forth, and the talk of using Dunkin' Donuts as an example, being open, having the drive-through, and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7259.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that what's different with this is when they bought their homes, it was always an establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7264.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was Mr. Donut, Dunkin' Donuts, there was something always there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7267.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is an establishment that's coming in with established families and homes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7271.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to just express what neighbors have called me about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7277.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One being, you know, the issues are going to have a noise, adding patrons at one in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7284.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: usually they're not the quietest people in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7286.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, you look at other takeout locations, you look at, for instance, Wendy's or Burger King, really don't about a neighborhood in that sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7297.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but we've also had issues with noise in those locations, but now coming into a neighborhood and understanding that and presenting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7306.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece is the actual air conditioning units and the nerve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7314.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's been mentioned before being on the on the subcommittee and chairperson for lighting and signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7318.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7340.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a very tough time and making sure we abide by these certain issues and blinking lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7345.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's great that we did these traffic mediations and all this stuff, but all you did now is we've added more lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7352.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've added more lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7354.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understanding how that is going to work with the neighbors and the people that have maybe a bedroom that abuts it maybe even 100 feet away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7364.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7365.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7367.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know the traffic issues, the way the design shows I, I don't, I don't see a real issue with that with the flow that it shows really directed people away so I think that that isn't a big issue I don't I don't think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7381.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then I don't know if people have told you in that area we have a huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7385.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: huge rodent issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7386.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now they're nervous that holy cow, we've had this rodent issue in this community and no one's responded to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7393.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one has come back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7395.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they looked at different, they looked at stop and shop and different, you know, facilities that have food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7401.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're bringing that 100 feet, 100 yards away from their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7404.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an eating establishment so now the nerves are heightened, and I just wanted to bring that up as, as we proceed through this process that these are really the contacts of information I got from from residents in that area so, and I know you know, I'm sure you agree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7420.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are very sensitive topics and they're very valuable but it's something as we move forward that I wanted to make sure I made after your presentation I brought that up because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7430.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the residents that reached out to me, I told him, listen and watch the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7435.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I asked previously to Danielle, if there was really public participation, her comments were well, here's today's public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7443.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that tells me we really didn't do much to really even though there were a couple of signs and we hit some of butters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7450.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The neighbors that I've talked to said they really weren't informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7453.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's neither here nor there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7455.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not your fault or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7456.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city clerk this other reasons, but I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7513.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that we've gone through this before with other facilities and other establishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7521.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's really aesthetic, it's not really set to hinder the decimal system, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7528.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Decimal level, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7542.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7543.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've had some studies in the past that have shown that if it's not made as a deterrent where the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7557.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the make of it isn't made to hinder the noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7561.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really, whether it's going up or down, this is, again, this is something new from the neighbors that live across the street on the other side, having, they don't know that until it's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7571.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why it's coming up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7573.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a way that something that's aesthetic that can also be, you know, protected by, you know, with the noise level that they could do both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7583.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7586.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something we can look at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7587.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know that this is these are things that the neighbors have asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10060.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council night, but the restriction with the trash pickup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12249.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's point of information question would be to my fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12252.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the beginning of that you said the leadership, how and when was this leadership taken, and we're all of this council privy to that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12265.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so the President and the Vice President met with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12270.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you saying you had you met with the mayor and you had the agenda that you and the president had to present to the mayor without the input of fellow councils, five other fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12281.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12289.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12292.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did this leadership team meet with this council person and say, we're going to the mayor as our leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12299.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did our leadership team come to this councilor that represents the people of the city and say, we have a plan that we want to present to the mayor as a councilor, do you agree?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12309.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you give me that opportunity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12312.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12313.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12314.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this agreement you have is fraudulent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12318.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't, it does not encompass what this, you can't put, you can't say, Madam President, that the leadership of this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12328.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: eliminating some Councilors in that decision and say that this isn't a fraudulent decision that you've made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12339.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it smells, if it walks like a duck, and it looks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12347.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I call into question for what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12350.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12351.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, the Councilor came into this chamber, looked at me and said to me and my fellow Councilor and said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12359.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk with the mayor and we have an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12363.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who is weak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12364.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm not weak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12368.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'm not weak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12369.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council to say that my leadership with YouTube, and you represent me one Councilor, I don't care about anybody else right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12376.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You represent this council, you never you to never talk told me about this presentation, you were going to give the mayor and what what negotiations you were going to have with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12387.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're telling me the mayor met with YouTube, and you had an agreement that you think that you were going to work out to give her the votes that she needs to pass this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12413.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12414.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because of open meeting, we're not allowed to have a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12417.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12419.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has the floor originally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12437.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, did the leadership talk to counter Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12442.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a question I have, did the leadership talk to Councilor Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12445.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership talk to Councilor Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12449.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership talk to Councilor Tseng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12451.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And did the leadership talk to Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12454.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership do those things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12455.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you did,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12457.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and without consulting maybe two or three or four and not all seven, then I'm going to have a problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12463.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to make sure that we look into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12465.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you did that, if you individually talk to each Councilor and presented a plan that went to the mayor to negotiate something without all of us together, I find it to be a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12485.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12486.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12487.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are you asking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12489.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just asked you the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12490.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you talk to Councilor- Did I violate the open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12493.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, did you meet, I never said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12495.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, I didn't say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12497.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, I said, did you individually, I didn't say violate an open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12502.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you individually meet with other councilors to present a plan that you were gonna bring to the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12509.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Be careful now, because there are ways to find things out now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12512.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the question I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12516.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you meet with other members of this council one on one didn't not saying you violate any open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12523.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you meet with other Councilors and present the plan that then went to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12530.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12531.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you talk to Councilman Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12534.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you count Scott's concept?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12547.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because why do you have a meeting with us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12548.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why did you put this up in a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12550.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These discussions occurred between other meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12553.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, it doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12556.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't make it that this council, all due respect, this council's worked hard to work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12561.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council has been standing side by side with all of these negative initiatives that we will follow through, we'll continue with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12569.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's a lot that's gonna be said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12571.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to go through that and then make a decision after talking to only three Councilors or two Councilors and then going to the mayor personally and negotiating something for what's best, the leadership for what's best for us in this city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12585.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12587.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody consulted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12587.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I gather, nobody consulted Councilor Caraviello or Councilor Knight or Councilor Collins, as you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12595.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find that a real problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12598.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12599.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12628.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I moved to table this meeting for another next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12632.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13335.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13336.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13338.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you're interested in... It's a question because I'm sure this point of information is simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13343.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question is this, does this body, the city council, are we not supposed to do what this council just said yes or no, what you just said, are we not supposed to be including what you just said, I'm bringing it to you as the first opportunity to you what I'm saying is, our duties as city Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13367.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: supposed to be given the respect of what you negotiated with as a normal process as a city councilor and that's what we want but you didn't do that that's exactly what we get we're gonna get that next budget we we get it anyway we don't by law we get it anyway obviously councilor collins was next to be recognized<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13781.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be nice if she was that was a question I was going to jump in if I can matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13784.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13786.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you tell us who's on the call as department heads?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13804.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent isn't on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14235.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, this council is gonna vote on a budget today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14239.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about, there was some changes that were made that really made you think of, this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14245.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I asked my fellow councilors to listen to what we just heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14250.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna take $500,000, $600,000 of ESSER money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14254.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna settle the budget on an election year to make everybody happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14259.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then next year, the teachers that you talk about, the kids that you talk about that you love,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14265.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be in such dire disrepair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14268.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how we're gonna dig out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14271.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14273.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand what we're doing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14275.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello presented the numbers that came out of the budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14278.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate the numbers you shared with me, because these are outstanding numbers that when we talk about funding for this community, of funding for a budget, of funding for a prop two and a half, of funding for these different projects, understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14295.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Planning and development $703,000 budgeted 226,000 was used 32% was the budget was spent 32% we spent police 14.3, we spent 7.4 51% of the budget wasn't spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14315.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW 12.9 spent 6.7, 52% of the budget wasn't spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14323.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fire department, excuse me, after DPW, these are the big five right now that we're bringing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14328.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the total expenditure is we're looking at, we're talking millions of dollars that have been mismanaged that we could have used<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14340.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we could have used to fix these gaps in the library, to fix the gaps in the school department, to fix the gaps on the streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14349.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, this council voted for bonds, 2.5 million, 2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14355.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We voted for bonds to do the work that was already in the budget, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14359.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are your numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14360.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the numbers that came from this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14364.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To see that we over-budgeted this much money is a gross, a gross mishandling of our city's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14373.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not yours, not mine, this community's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14378.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14380.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about millions and millions of dollars that we didn't use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14384.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So listen, I'm looking at apples to apples before we got this information, before we got to finally sit down, because when you get the budget book on the Friday or Father's Day weekend, it's really tough to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14396.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we get to this point and we talk about what are we doing, in most communities, as you brought up, Madam Chief of Staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14405.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In most communities, like tomorrow night, I'll be sitting in Somerville, it's called Cut Night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14410.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every department head will be here to support any questions at the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14413.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the respect they get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14416.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest budget line we have is education, and our superintendent isn't even here to answer a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14423.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I had other questions that was brought to my attention after looking at the capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14428.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, the neglected fields behind Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14433.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that have been out past this day over five years, that if we end up doing a study, which happens every year, it should, and it shows that that field is unsafe, we have to close two of the most important fields down the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14446.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see anything, which is a huge revenue generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14450.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I was going to ask the superintendent tonight, but she's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14455.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are serious issues that we don't have any department head in front of us that we can ask these questions, because I would love to talk to the department heads, because I'm gonna be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14466.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to some department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14468.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to people that are in the know, because believe it or not, there are still relationships here, and they're petrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14475.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, don't ever speak my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14477.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want you to understand that the confusion they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14483.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the way we run a budget, they're very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14486.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when they do their lines, and they then match up what's presented to them, they're totally confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14493.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bet you what, if I do a Freedom of Information Act, and I ask for any communications between department heads to a director of finance, we're gonna see some questions that department heads are very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14508.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about this budget, when we've been talking about this budget as a union, we've been talking about what the mismanagement has been with this council for months, if not a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14519.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For what we've been promised, what we weren't, remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14522.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, I'm gonna not say the council's name, but remember, I will never let that happen to me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14529.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor lied to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14530.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will never let it happen to me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14534.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She promises everything last year at one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14536.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We get nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14537.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here we are today to consider that you're going to vote for this budget with these questions befuddling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14548.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are serious issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14550.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are issues that this councilor, I'm going to reach out and find out on what avenues we can take to do a deep dive in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14558.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we do an audit, but this is something that frightens me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14562.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if Councilor Caraviello said it's a pattern, this is one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14565.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's a pattern for three years, what are we doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14568.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gross mismanagement of our city funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14572.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gross mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14574.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14576.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take a deep breath, go sit down with your budget book, because when I asked this question, if this was real or not, it's in your numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14584.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's in your book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14587.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are not just a couple of percent, because I've asked a couple of finance directors in neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14592.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rarely you look at an overage about two and a half to three and a half percent, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14595.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they look at, usually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14597.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the gap that other communities they say that they put into, about two and a half to three and a half percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14605.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 32, 51, 52, 57, 59, that's only five departments that we over budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14613.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if this council wants to vote for this budget, when you hear these facts and say, this is better for our community, think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14622.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it, no matter what was said or what was negotiated, think about what the numbers in front of you say before you vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14628.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, if you support this with this information in front of you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14634.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody's watching, because remember, you vote, and you represent every member of this community, and you're their fiscal watchdog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14644.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I appreciate your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14646.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we talked and you gave me this, I couldn't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14648.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I went back and I looked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14649.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not a really numbers guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14652.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I went and sat with a few people that I can talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14656.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they couldn't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14667.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is gonna be, if tonight's gonna be a gotcha game or you win or we win, we all lose if this budget passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14672.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14673.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14676.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just if they have a response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15199.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can, so we have other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15230.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was that we have something public that the mayor is agreed with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15235.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did she not publicly give us other issues last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15239.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we not have other public issues last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15240.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this what you're going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15319.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15321.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you point of information point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15326.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, with this information you just gave us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15329.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just openly told us that the numbers we have aren't true, how can we go to this budget should we vote on this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15403.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Councilor Tseng-Wook done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15448.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry very, very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15452.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it that it's in doubt that we have a software that the finance director has concerns with and would presented a budget that I find that it's on a slippery slope right now to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15465.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also think that my fellow councils are making a decision because publicly things were promised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15473.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As if we weren't remember when we were promised the city solicitor, we didn't get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15478.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: last year when we were given a city solicitor, and we were given the other options that we sat here for and waited for and we got, we never came through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15485.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want you to forget that I want to make sure it's on the public record that I said that, because the reason why my fellow council said they were in favor of this budget because whatever was whatever was discussed and agreed on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15500.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's discussed in open, and it's been, it's public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15504.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15506.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we've never been lied to before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15511.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, the reason why I say this, and I know, listen, we still have questions that still haven't been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15521.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked for a copy of the consultant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15526.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who put the safety of our kids in the high school on the forefront of his report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15533.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've yet to see that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15535.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we know- The Welsh report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15537.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it hasn't been discussed in the budget that even though we haven't, the $900,000 was asked because of the report coming from the school committee, the $900,000 was asked in that report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15552.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make Medford High School safe and efficient moving forward, like the addition of principals, like the addition of more paraprofessionals, like the addition of monitors, like the addition of security systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15568.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we're gonna vote on something without taking that consultant and not honor what they've said and agree that we'll let ESSER funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15581.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fix the deficit that we all so strongly were negatively against because of this factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15587.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all we're doing is pushing this down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15590.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And openly, Madam Mayor, Madam President, this looks like, as long as it gets through this budget season, because November is a very important season, that let's not worry about that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15601.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's just get through the season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15602.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get through the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15606.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15607.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to share that with my fellow Councilors, and I would yield now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15623.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but the report, we want to see the report, because what I will tell you- I didn't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15627.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, but what I will tell you too is when I talked to the teachers that were actually interviewed, they were so impressed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15635.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by the consultant and they had they they finally felt like they were listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15640.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after the meeting that I missed on Wednesday, unfortunately, what I found out from some of these teachers that who, by the way, who are now gone, teachers that have been in the system for years who left, they've had enough, they moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15651.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's speaking freely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15653.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when they tell me that come September, if these things aren't in place, we're going to be in the same situation of fear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15664.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and safety concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15666.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what they've shared with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15667.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna share that with you because I haven't seen anything about increase in principals and assistant principals, and we're talking about whatever, and if it is done the way it's funded right now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15680.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Chief of Staff, the way it's funded, we're looking at $600,000 right off the top next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15686.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever we're gonna implement, it might be good for a year, but then it's all gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15691.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just don't think that's a sound<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15695.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fiscal responsible decision we can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15697.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15699.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15702.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if you can, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=19.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=312.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=313.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna speak more of a personal level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=317.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've known Henry a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=318.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Henry and my dad were very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=321.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember many a night in Boston Ave in West Medford with Henry, my dad, and Mr. Caggiano just hanging out and drinking homemade wine and telling stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=333.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you just realize, I often talk about when great residents pass on, who steps up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=341.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's refreshing when you could talk about a resident like Henry Miller and his lovely wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=347.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what they've done for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=349.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's not someone that sits back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=351.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He sees an issue and he attacks it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=354.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's always there to lend his word, whether you want to hear it or not, whether you like it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=360.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate his friendship and we should all be honored to have residents like the Miller and family here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=369.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=390.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found them in order and will approve, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=439.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I think that we've already, I think coming from Representative Dash, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=446.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would sum it up for us and give us a brief synopsis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=449.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've already gone through this, but I'd appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=516.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I make a recommendation that we table this until October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=521.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: until date certain, which would be the date of November 28th or meeting that close to that day, whether it's the 1st of December, if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=869.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=871.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears, for bringing this forward because, you know, listen to everybody's points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=876.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is a complicated situation, and I think that this brings me to my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=880.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a couple of business owners that people aren't realizing some of the traffic calming measures that we've implemented<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=890.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you an example, one of our local businesses had five delivery drivers that were always on the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=899.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they're finding right now is he had to let go of two delivery drivers, but the outside agencies, Grubhub, all the other automobile delivery services,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=912.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they've increased, he said, over 75%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=916.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they're doing is they don't care where they're parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=919.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're still parking in the bike lanes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=921.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're still parking, you know, we've lost control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=924.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason why I bring that up is because I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=927.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward to make these decisions, and I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this up, because I have neighbors calling me about that whole neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=934.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where it is a cut through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=935.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was no different than what a couple years ago was Fulton Street, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=938.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a Fulton Street area, the corridor, and people have just forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=941.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're so fed up with it that they're just living with it by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=945.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue I'm seeing is that it's good to do initial conversation with that traffic engineer, but I think we need to start involving the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=954.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that I got a few phone calls the other day with the whole idea of eliminating left-hand turns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=961.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, people calling me saying, well, where is that going to now lead the people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=965.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to lead them right into their right turns into their neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=969.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're, instead of going 50-50, their discussion is now you're flooding that area with 100% of the traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=977.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the truth of the matter is, there is no communication with the neighbors in those neighborhoods that are affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=985.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, but I think we need to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=989.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support Councilor Bears' initiative in getting our traffic engineer and working on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=995.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that corridor, but at the same time, I think that we should do this shockingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1001.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the word transparent because it's never used in this community, but bringing the neighborhood into the meetings, bringing the neighborhood into the meetings with the traffic engineer and say, okay, what would one solution that you think, how would that solution affect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1018.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: other situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1020.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're not seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1021.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know, just today to get emails and phone calls from from residents and business owners saying, you know, George, I know the sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1029.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know what it checks a certain box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1031.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, his business has increased automobile traffic that are parking, there's no enforcement use, we all see it, lift, whatever they are, whoever they are, they all they pull over wherever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1048.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they pull into bike lanes, they block driveways, and they do whatever, they are now dictating what happens on our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1056.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm gonna second Councilor Bears' initiative, but I would really like to see more community participation in these decisions so we can really get a true outlook, outline of what everybody sees, the people that live there every single day, and how one issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1076.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one solution can affect another and just at least vet that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1080.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1917.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1917.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to share with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1919.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've received multiple phone calls, especially Ward 6, that we did get an email from the chief of staff, and I'll read that if that's okay, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1930.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Dear President Morell and city councilors, we recently learned that some addresses who are requesting early voting ballots have received more than one ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1941.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A short while ago, Steve Smerti and I met with elections to better understand what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1948.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the uh...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1951.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, this process is not, it happened, there's still checks and balances that are in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1960.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, my email is breaking up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1962.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the system that would prevent someone from being able to physically cast multiple ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1967.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are fail-safes to make sure that you cannot vote twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1972.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Specifically, there is a unique identifier assigned to each voter and only allows them to cast a ballot once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1979.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we learn more about how this happened and steps that are going to be taken to avoid this from reoccurring, we will update the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1987.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that what I appreciate going forward with this resolution is the first thing is just to express that multiple phone calls that are very, very concerned with voter fraud, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2002.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the conspiracy theorists are going crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2005.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think my concern right now is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2009.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen some pretty drastic issues in the last month dealing with this election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2015.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One being that I believe the ballots, there were misspelled names and they had to redo ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2020.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2022.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now with these ballots, it's not a few people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2026.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I guess I got a phone call from one person that said they requested two, they got eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2031.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is scary for the sense that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2037.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's gotta be some people held accountable for this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2043.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this administration is fluffing this over like it's nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2049.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's costing the city a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2051.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's begin with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2052.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if they're giving away ballots, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2056.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the misspelling ballots and then the ballots have to redone in a rush order to make sure that we can have a true election, this is a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2066.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2070.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, I brought this up just to explain it, understand that I've talked to a very knowledgeable former elections coordinator that told me that George is no way that, you know, what people are saying on the streets, that that person is gonna take eight votes and they're gonna go to the ballot box, they're gonna mail eight votes for so-and-so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2092.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And rest assured, that's not the way it can happen that way because of the fail safes that are on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2098.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2099.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to make sure everybody knows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2101.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I think we have to realize something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2106.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're two weeks away from a very big election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2110.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've had two major flops with this election process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2116.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't look well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2118.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't look like it's being handled by a leader in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2125.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, we're moving forward for two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2127.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just pray that we're kept in the loop with everything that's happening because again, unfortunately, I was gonna bring this forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2135.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad we got the email beforehand because I believe it was only one district, one precinct that really-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2145.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2147.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, I think moving forward, we need to, we need to buckle down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2152.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, this is, this is, you know, you see what's going on in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2156.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every, the issue in this country is in what's inflammatory is voter fraud and everybody's going crazy about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2164.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing ourselves any favors in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2168.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just had to, I had to share my frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2172.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had to calm some people's nerves and understand publicly that there are fail safes in place, even though they're getting 10 ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2179.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sure I'm gonna get text message and emails later saying, oh, no way, they'll find a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2184.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there isn't a way that they can use all eight ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2190.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, moving forward, I think we really have to tighten this department up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2196.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it starts with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2198.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that it sounds political, but truly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2203.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's the CEO of this community, and this is happening under her watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2208.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2210.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2534.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2535.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council bears brings up a great point, not to be insensitive, but we're two weeks away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2540.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who else is supporting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2544.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have an elections coordinator who's not here two weeks before the election with these issues, who's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2553.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2553.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2554.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who's supporting that department right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2557.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have any information with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2567.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2569.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I didn't want but I appreciate because I think it is so sensitive right now, that it is heightened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2576.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that who's supporting, you know, I don't, you know, we were very fortunate under clerk, he, you know, we had a great team together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2587.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and Councilor Bears is right, that's something we talked about at budget time, of the reduction of staff, and situations happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2598.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every employee, they have the right, if they're injured, or sick, or hurt, that they need to take care of what they need to care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2604.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't wanna be insensitive to that at all, but the truth of the matter is, we're still two weeks away from a very important election, in my eyes, because I'm running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2615.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, I think it's important that I'd like to, if we can, I'd like to make a motion to see, can we ask the administration, are they supporting the staff, even if our director is on remotely, having people in the office is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2640.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, is this somebody that are they working with maybe getting someone in for the next two weeks and three weeks to try to make sure that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2647.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're, we're filling the gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2657.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you tell me what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2662.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to say she hasn't been in or I think it was just like, she couldn't attend tonight because I'm just, and I'm just saying, if this is something that's longterm, we really need to find a way that we have assisted, we get assistance to that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3742.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, and in a municipality, anytime there is any any pay that was that was distinguished during a certain time when a retiree was on duty, they would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3757.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's automatic, this is confusing me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3759.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's clerical error, but you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3763.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair labor, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3767.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's definitely a fair labor act issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3768.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you're talking about, again, our working men and women in our community, they're telling you that the money that everybody's getting, while you were there too, by the way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3781.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through the through the worst time of our hyperinflation, you were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3787.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3789.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if the President can reach out to the city administration to get an answer by as soon as they can to get us an email that the chief of staff can inform us why this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3801.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know if there's anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3803.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that how you're the only person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3813.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe anything that's negotiated... Right, I was active in negotiations, and I worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3818.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything that's negotiated during the time that any retiree was still in place, they would be... I didn't retire, I actually resigned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3826.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, or resigned, doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3827.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As long as you're working during that time, you are giving the same amount, same treatment, same incentives that they received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3842.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shockingly, we have another issue with our labor question with our working men and women here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3849.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shockingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3851.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, I think we need to get word on this and get get it back to us as soon as possible because if, if we haven't, if we have one that's one too many, it was city employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3873.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, well, we can see that, but, you know, rumor has it there's a great team somewhere in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3878.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3879.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I think that, I don't know who to ask because I don't know what department's in and out, but- I'll reach out to the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3884.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can go HR, chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3898.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, and then ask if there's any other employees, because I bet you there's other employees that just washed their hands of Medford and said, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3904.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Typical Medford, they walk away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3906.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if they earned it, they deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3913.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3914.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3915.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3916.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3916.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get some answers, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3918.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if we can, I'll put it on as a resolution for our next meeting to make sure that we follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3922.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3922.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good luck, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2140.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2141.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2148.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm listening and I appreciate that, you know, understanding this with clarity and making sure like we talked about, making sure that the information is out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2159.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this meeting is perfect because it is the information that will help us guide us for our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2164.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=123.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=262.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before we go on, can I just address my original question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=268.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=271.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pete, there are questions, um, that I know that, um, there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to, to, uh, meetings minutes and how long we could speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=283.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there are follow up questions, and if there's one question, I believe council bears explain the process that we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=290.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, as council president, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=298.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=306.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope we would do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=308.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other question that Councilor Bears did read, did speak about is that we all asked for information to be sent out to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=318.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's response, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=322.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or given, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=337.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sending this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=350.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=358.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=365.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=374.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got that, that response was today, correct, Council Beers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=376.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was 10 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=392.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=398.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=404.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Adam, did you forward this to everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=843.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the word transparent gets thrown around, Ted, and I hate for you to get dragged into this, but you weren't part of any financial task force for the override, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=859.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Normally, when communities put this into place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=863.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm told from different communities, different assessors, finance directors, that they usually line this up prior to any budget meetings, so we can help our most vulnerable people in our community understand what any impact it would make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=878.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this calculation that you're doing for us, and thank you so much for doing it, because I know there were so many questions with the calculations that have been public on the side that you had nothing to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=888.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it came out of a state website, but it didn't truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=894.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: calculate the newer assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=896.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's correct, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this and now we're doing it on the 11th hour, the question was normally in your experience, other professionals in your field, this is done usually during budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=913.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can prepare our residents that if there was an increase of 373 median price,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=922.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=923.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it sounds minimal to some people because it's only, that's all we keep hearing, it's only, but is it odd that we're doing this so late?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=945.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=947.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=950.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1135.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1136.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With just a couple more questions, I know that you mentioned that this doesn't have any impact on question six, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1143.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not in fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1145.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's not enough time to put everything in, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1148.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know the actual numbers, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1155.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but we still don't know how much for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1158.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an open-ended, as it said in the question, there's nothing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1169.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1170.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I realize the exemptions are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1173.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I know that there are options when you do this ahead of time is to really prepare your seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1179.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the exemptions sound good, but when you read them and you talk to actual people, there are a lot of senior citizens that really don't fit in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1187.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are no other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1190.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know the buzzwords easy to say, we do have exemptions, but when you put it apples to apples and you sit with the senior citizen and you go through their situation, I'm sure you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1200.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mrs. Jones bought her house with her husband 55 years ago for 50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1204.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the house is appraised at a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1208.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it really doesn't help what we're offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1211.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a funny number and there could be something done more if we had time for an exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1218.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1219.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if we had time, this is something we could petition to see if we can really truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1224.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1226.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that must be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1227.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the, the last piece to this, I think that when they look at this and because one question I have Ted is that a lot of people have asked, not just seniors, um, that the, this is like a one time tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1240.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1241.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see that 4% above your two and a half percent increase, that's going to be compounded year after year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1249.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that's going to go away like debt exclusion, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1257.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so that'll grow forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1259.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the other piece that people have to understand too, and it's a tough office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1264.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, when you hear the misconceptions, I just need your input to educate our residents and understanding that, again, I believe the mayor said her house is only $13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1275.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some others here said their house is $40 a month or whatever, and we can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1281.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That might be the first year, but again, we were told, I think someone from your office emailed us and said that we'll be reassessing again in 2025 for 2026 using the data for 2023, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1310.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1311.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1312.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for helping with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1314.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, when this tax goes in, it's now assessed again, the homes will be assessed again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1323.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but we're seeing that most assessments, because I could tell you, I'm dealing with my own family members that are looking at a $400 increase per month for his new assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1336.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1337.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that what people also have to understand is that it's not just the home tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1342.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've seen their cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1347.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motor vehicle excise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1348.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vehicle excise tax is going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1350.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see the CPA tax because your homes are going to be assessed higher now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1354.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now the CPA tax will also be taxed higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1357.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see that a little bit higher, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1360.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's yeah, that's generally correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1366.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1367.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you're seeing is, it's not just it's not just an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1374.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1375.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's compounded year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1377.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a tax that increases in the CPA as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1380.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the excise tax that increases as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1383.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so much more than just 13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1385.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my point I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1387.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's easy to look at a site that wasn't put forth by our office because we know that although it's correct, the numbers that my colleagues did put out there on a page, it does give the numbers that are true and factual, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1403.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't include the assessments that residents had, and I'll use my brother's example, because his house was appraised at, on the calculations, at $800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1413.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His house is now appraised at $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1415.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why we're seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1417.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1419.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is family-owned homes that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1422.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we passed on to generation to generation, just like most people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1426.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1427.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I'm monopolizing the time because I think it's important, because these are the questions the people that are sitting in this in this room right now and their friends have contacted me and said, we're very confused, Mr. Scappelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1438.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because even something simple as, Mr. Scarpelli, why are we fighting for $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1445.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, no, no, this has nothing to do with the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1447.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1448.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people understanding that, well, this is a fight between schools and kids and senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1455.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1456.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just want to make sure all the information's out so every resident understands the impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1462.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that, and we could talk about solutions as we go, because there are solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1466.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were solutions back in April, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1593.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the microphone on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1597.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Andrew, is the mic, turn the mic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2045.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me start off by first saying that unfortunately this administration has divided this community for the children in the schools and the seniors or the homeowners or renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2057.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say shame on this administration, shame on this council, shame on the financial task force, because the bottom line is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2065.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group knew that we were heading in some tough waters back in June 20th of 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2072.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you could see that in a city council budget meeting when council beers met with the mayor behind closed doors to set up some sort of deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2081.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't know what that deal was, but they created a financial task force and that financial task force put together a plan of an override without anybody's knowledge, anybody's input or any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2094.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or any community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2097.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no issues with our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2101.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a fair tactic and fair tactic only for the fact that we should remember this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2107.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Back in April, back in May, back in June, when the city had $25 million in free cash, it was my responsibility to bring forth that we take that $5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2119.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: levy that budget, make sure there were no cuts, understand the process, and then move forward to see if we truly need an override, which I never said that should never be an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2130.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to hear parents and teachers and friends and family say, George, explain this to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2138.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes knew that this was gonna be a devastating situation, but it could have been solved and still could be solved with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2147.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have plenty of free cash in the system not to turn the city upside down or divide the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2153.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, remember, I'll leave you with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2156.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're asking for in the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2159.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this override doesn't mean you'll get exactly what you think you're gonna get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2165.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all these cuts were made to set up this override as a fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2170.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli is not against the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2173.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just hope that people understand that this could be soft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2178.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2530.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2532.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I heard some similar situations with, I know what the assessor came up and gave us medium price homes, but we're seeing real people have told me that this is what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2544.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing the increase close to $60,000, most homes that you're seeing an increase at a higher percentage rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2551.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, on top of all of what we talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2554.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with this, so it's not the $13 a month, the $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2557.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the pieces that this gentleman just said is the understanding that I never thought that our home insurance now will now increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2568.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this isn't them against us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2572.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is understanding that we have viable options right now to fix this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2579.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with free cash and then work together to see how we can have an open process to really include all the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, that no one is hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2590.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2917.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2918.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I think my council is not understanding the free cash should be used now to fix a problem now, which we have, and I appreciate the clarification it's only $3 million accounts accounting and just said to fix the school budget, but the key issue isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2933.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't the process of getting this fixed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2936.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem that we've had, and we could use the pandemic and use the pandemic over and over again, but what neighboring communities are doing during the pandemic with the infrastructure money that was given through ARPA, that wasn't intended for, for the roads and sidewalks that you're asking for right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2951.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2952.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor had to balance our budget through ESSER and ARPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2957.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the easy way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2958.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's like paying your mortgage with a credit card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2961.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2962.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2963.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody hasn't said it, but the difference between why we're here and we're in trouble is because of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2970.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth is what pushes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2973.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our value, our income up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2975.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It gives us more tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2977.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It brings more money so we can do all the things we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2980.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This mayor has done nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2982.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had shovel in the ground in five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2985.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about, I know my council friends have gone out and told people that Massachusetts is the number one, Medford is the number one community new growth in permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2995.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong, I sat with the commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2997.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Permitting their fine, the biggest concerns we're having, look at the process that she lost fighting 40B projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3005.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One project alone was $3 to $5 million in permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3010.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then an additional $7 to $9 million that would have come in as new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3015.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one job that she fought in court, lost and appealed it, and this group had to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3021.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem isn't our tax base, because our assessments are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3025.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're paying more than anybody else in neighboring communities because our assessments are so high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3031.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will share my last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3034.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighbor communities per child, Malden, Arlington, Winchester, between 15 and 17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3042.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford, we pay $22,000 per student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3045.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it a management issue or is it really we don't have enough money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3049.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it because it's public. $22,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3530.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this financial task force was put together without any individual involved in that comment that a young lady put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3542.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3544.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3546.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't planned to educate our seniors, educate our residents, educate our renters, educate our landlords, so they could prepare themselves for what's being asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3557.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: within a vote that was presented, a discussion was presented on a Thursday, voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3564.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not one community meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3565.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, I will share this with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3569.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a FOIA request put out by a resident that asked a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3575.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They asked for all of the information, minutes for the meetings, any information, letters, any emails, any text messages, with this financial task force, with any building or any entity within the city to figure out if this is needed or how it will be used and how it can work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3593.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 150 pages later, all the information that was in that FOIA request were information about when we can meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3600.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing that's solid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3602.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would also share with these parents that are so concerned about what's happening, we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3608.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: saw the information back from the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3612.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school department communications director answered by saying, thank you for the FOIA request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3617.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We apologize for the tardy response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3620.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after investigating, there was no school department employee or member of the school department involved in any financial task force<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3630.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dealing with these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3631.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what again, what we're saying is we don't know if an override is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3636.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know one thing, we know we could fix this issue right now with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3641.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our students and teachers and families are fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3644.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we go back to the drawing board as a community together to see what we really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3650.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the mayor isn't gonna put new growth out there, she's not gonna work to bring in creatively, bring in funding for the city, then maybe we can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4026.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Financial director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4203.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, let me help you, Mr. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4206.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force was a farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4208.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a lack of transparency throughout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4211.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you speak on, I speak to this in where I worked in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4216.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we met in a possible override in a neighboring community, we talked about three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4221.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was how do we get here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4223.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we do to fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4224.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how does this happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4226.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those people brought in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4228.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mines from Tufts, Harvard, MIT, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4233.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They brought in their financial team, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4237.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had their assessor set the rate so people can understand, assessor was never involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4241.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look at how this was done, this was done in a bubble, this was presented on a Thursday, and then voted for in the budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4249.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look at the budget meetings, when I brought up the way to fix it, which is free cash, and I'll disagree with my fellow Councilor, because she's wrong 1,000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4261.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash for divisional local services, it's not recommended, but not against the law to use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4269.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 3 to 5% annual budget, FY24 method generated $9 million to add to a $25 million estimate, which means the city had around 16% of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4281.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, the solution was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4284.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have this financial task force present this to the community, because that's what I asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4289.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked my colleagues, when are we going to present what the findings were?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4293.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were no findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4294.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just given, we're going to do an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4296.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People came up, shared, the mayor was happy, and it was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4299.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4302.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was no one involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4304.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble to scare people, to come out and say, the schools, the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4310.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4311.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said this in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said it in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it today again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4314.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need an override, but if we do it right, with open and transparent government, we could do something great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4321.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now remember, with one override in every other community, there's two, three to follow, and don't forget, this council's gonna ask for a 200 to $400 million debt exclusion from New High School, which we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4332.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4334.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't be confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4336.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not telling you the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4337.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4339.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4854.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4855.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people should understand the mayor came out just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4858.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had 34 million, 34.5 million as of July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4863.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor, just so you know, what free cash is, it's your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4866.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we say we're going to fund 50 teachers and we don't pay those 50 teachers because they don't hire them, that money goes into free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4875.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our money, that's your tax money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4877.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then it could be used for what it needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4879.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's truly mismanagement of funds from our leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4884.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's taking what we sign off on our budget and not use correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4889.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we have right now, I believe I've said this, Councilor Leming said it over and over again, I'm not saying use free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4897.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a deficit right now, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4900.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we can correct right now and not put the schools and kids and teachers in fear and say let's level fund that budget using one time free cash one time and then look into what options we have later but let's listen to the mayor what she said 34.5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4916.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now she knows the override's gonna be a fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4918.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What does she do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4919.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom, she starts putting all these different monies in different accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4923.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from her words exactly in her video the other day, we have 18.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4928.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With that said, we can still take funding to level the school budget and still have 14, $15 million, which still leaves enough in there that would appease any bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4940.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, let's not get scared because that's a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4944.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see the bond rating so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4946.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, when we look at this situation, council, different communities, free cash, Arlington is 18 million, Framingham 14 million, bigger budget, Quincy 1.2 million, bigger budget, Andover 14 million, Newton, these communities are bigger than ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4964.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have this budget, they function with lower funding and free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4971.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand this, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4972.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can do this one-time cost to save the fare from our schools, take care of our seniors, our renters, our homeowners, so we can stop the fare in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4982.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, vote no on these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4987.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4988.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5219.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's 18.5 left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5226.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5438.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. Giglio, these are all scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5443.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, the financial task force didn't have the FOIA requests that shows that there were no documentations, no minutes, no information given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5453.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard the assessor, we know all the major parties, the school department, the assessor, the finance director, weren't involved in these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5462.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, it's not a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5464.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just said it, you heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5466.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Put 30 seconds back on for interrupting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5468.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the understanding that the sky is falling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5474.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of these projects that we need to fix, we need to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5477.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In normal communities, what we do is we bond these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5481.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we look at situations that we talked about earlier, when it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5486.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're trying, what we're seeing here right now, Mr. Joyo, it's the underfunding of local revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5496.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One second, I'll just, it's the focus of what we're seeing that our community has done for years here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5502.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's show lower meals tax and hotel tax and excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5507.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then when it comes higher, you can put that and use it for whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5511.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let that be known, the understanding what you're asking for, there are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5515.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem we hear right now, why the city's divided, why our seniors are scared, why our landlords are scared, why our homeowners and renters are afraid right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5523.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why our students and parents and teachers are afraid is because this group did something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5529.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They put it out there without any true information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5531.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5533.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't been educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5534.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why there's so much fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5536.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The firefighters aren't supporting a $30 million fire station, because again, there was no transparency there when it came to the final decision that had to be made for 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5544.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've decided to go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5546.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They decided to go public to say, let's not hurt our taxpayers with whatever, how many it's going to be, because we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5553.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be a $50 million fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5555.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the design was never put forth to the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5559.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you say totality, six, seven, and eight, we haven't been involved, Mr. Gileo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5564.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5565.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5566.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this group did it in the financial task force that presented it on a Thursday, voted on it on a Tuesday, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5574.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We find $9 million in free cash after that, that the man knew was certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5583.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, can I say one more thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5685.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wouldn't know that because it's literally in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6037.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the fair tactics, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6038.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6041.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's Councilor Leming said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6044.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we haven't done it, so let's do it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6047.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just because we haven't done it, let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6049.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the roads, now we hear the schools were built bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6054.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's all fair, this is all fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6056.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here's the thing, we're not saying that, let's not look at this properly and do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6064.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6065.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6067.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it so privately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6068.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it where it's gonna hurt so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6072.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the finger-pointing between teachers and finger-pointing between seniors and kids, and it's a shame what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6082.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can correct this right now with the free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6085.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they say, the truth of the matter is we have free cash to make sure that seven and eight are correctable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6092.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know question six is correctable by listening to our firefighters, who will tell you straightforward that the mayor's not telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6102.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they're building there is insufficient, and it's going to put us 30 years behind in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6108.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please understand this, Mr. Gervino, when you say all this information and how it gets out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6114.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though councils want to say we did, we haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6117.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our seniors for what's going to happen on January 1st of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6122.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once the new assessment, once the new tax bills come out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6126.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared up our, our, our landlords to how they're going to handle single parent, uh, renters in their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6132.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our renters when increase goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6135.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6136.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Somebody called me when I put a post out about a woman that called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6140.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She has two children, and the landlord said, I'm not going to hit you with the assessment raise, but I'm going to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6147.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got to tell you, I'm going to have to raise your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6151.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And someone asked me, well, are you going to support rent control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6154.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, there's another wrong that doesn't make a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6157.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, there's a system in place with this group that's telling you what you should do out of fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6163.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, again, we have the funds to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6167.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they're saying, it's absolutely above board to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6172.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand it was done with mismanagement throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6177.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6514.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6524.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6527.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6528.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6529.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And by law, you're supposed to take the letter of what the questions are and use those funding as closely as you can to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6538.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions as they're read are very vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6542.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it really doesn't mean it's gonna go directly to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6546.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be portions of that or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6548.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'll bring us back to the budget meeting when school committee member Jenny Graham was asked a question, if we were given $5 million, would everybody go back to those positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6559.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6561.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next evening, the school's financial director and the school superintendent, when I asked that question from the evening before, she said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6571.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money would go back into their fund and they would distribute it to what they think is best for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6577.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6580.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6581.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about all these different cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6583.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't filled, I believe now 29 teachers in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6589.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's funding we haven't, we paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6591.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have so many dire issues, so many, the fiscal crisis we've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6597.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same breath, we're asking to bring in shiny new programs that are new, that are costing the school department $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6606.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about a city council that during this financial crisis talked about, did what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6612.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We found $9 million of free cash when they looked at the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6616.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6617.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They voted themselves a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6619.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the SIKU committee now goes from $10,000 to $12,000 up to $22,000, $24,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6626.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor gets an increase three times, three different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6630.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore all of you who are open-minded thinkers, are you sure we're in a fiscal crisis or are we in a problem with this fiscal mismanagement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6726.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6951.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Councilor Bielsa, in question six, I think we have a firefighters union here that have been involved in the negotiation because there is no limit on question six, truly is no limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6962.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6964.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's wide open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that if we can maybe have a fire fighters that have been working on this, just to give us an idea of what the process was, the beginning, what we were looking at for a number and how, how much it's dropped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6978.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can understand truly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6984.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6985.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm sorry, hopefully the firefighters can have an opportunity to express why they want to vote no on this debt exclusion because I think what you asked, there is such fluctuation and what's true, what they needed and what was agreed upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7003.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before the mayor became very angry with the firefighters and then started cutting and cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7008.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we're left with an inferior product that our firemen and women, firefighter men and women said over and over again, that please do not hurt the residents of this community with an inferior station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7020.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7021.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wait, maybe down the line, we could rethink this and refocus on what we could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7025.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for now, we're saying, let's not hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have teachers that are saying, let's not hurt our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7031.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have firefighters saying, let's not hurt the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7034.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions you're asking should have been out there for you, Joan, months and months ago, so you could truly understand the impact that you're going to feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7043.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is where we talk about the lack of transparency and why this should be taken off the table and people should vote no, because the bottom line is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7053.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fear of children, that should be fixed with the $3 million from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7057.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor said it, we have 18.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7059.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could still take 3 million out and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7061.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll still have enough to keep our bond rating up and look to bond other projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7066.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or maybe we sit together again as a true financial working group, a task force, and say, how do we do this together as a community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7074.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not gonna look later because there's no guarantees that there won't be another override next year, I promise you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7080.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because every other community that's gone that way have asked for two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7626.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7629.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't this a total microcosm of what we're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7633.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what 678 is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7635.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so much confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7638.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, we have to understand the feasibility study that was done is what gets us the funding for through procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7645.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we know the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7647.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When my fellow council said that this is a city building and firefighters, I don't know what the comment was, that is so irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7654.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To understand that this fire department's gonna stand up and say, no, we don't want a new headquarters because it's insufficient and it will hurt our community funding-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7665.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we say the needs of the community, we mean proper safe staffing and department and ability to add technical rescue specialist services to our emergency response, which will bring better services to the citizens in every call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7678.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's wrong what they're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7679.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're asking for a fire stations adequate to help our community grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7685.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The proposed design does not adequately address the health and safety issues of the fire service regarding cancer exposure mitigations, the privacy concerns which have never been addressed properly by our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7697.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Adults deserve privacy regardless of the gender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7700.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't an issue which is female and men.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7703.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you understand the design that was presented has firefighters after a fire showering downstairs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7709.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: walking upstairs in a towel or a bathrobe, walking down a community hallway to get to their quarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7716.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, their quarters did not consist of a locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7721.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7722.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are issues that I can't even believe that we would entertain this with so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7728.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how six, seven, and eight were all done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7730.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were all done in a bubble that we're supposedly battled over on social media by a leader of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7739.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the former fire chief here, we have the leaders of our fire department that have openly said, we don't want to hurt our citizenry and putting $30 million, let alone $3 into this because we don't know what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8151.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate my fellow Councilor being in my mind to understand what my plan was, was to get the superintendent to say something she didn't wanna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8162.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate the resident who put all of the meetings out on social media because you could say whatever you want about George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8174.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say that he's a liar, but when there are video and documentations with it, simple question to the superintendent was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8182.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Will this money, will it be made whole like Councilor, School Committee Woman Graham mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8187.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her simple answer was no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8189.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't trying to have her say anything any different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8191.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, what we're seeing in the school system after that vote, there were many teachers and many programs that were dismissed and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8200.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had the band leader who left right away because there were promised things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8204.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, we had to believe a $200,000 line put in place for City Year, which is a great program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8210.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great program, but when you have so many fiscal crises in the city, why are we funding something that's just a shiny nickel right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8217.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues with this, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8220.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore you just to listen to the common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8224.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen to the understanding that you can use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8227.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former teacher, and a parent of public school kids, and a coach, I understand, I lived it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8235.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8237.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I also understand and how to move forward without hurting our whole community or without dividing our whole community, because this is what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8247.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These override questions are hurting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8250.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have the information that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8253.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not spelled out correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8255.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't truly know, although like Councilor Kelly had said, yeah, it goes to the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8260.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where that money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8263.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have teachers positions open with money in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8265.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, there's a lot of money that hasn't been used to date that we can still use, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8537.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we went over this again, just to reiterate to people that are new to the room, $37, that's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8544.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coming from people that truly don't understand the impact, because a lot of people here, imagine just $37 a month, what that would do to people sitting in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8552.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine the impact, because that's been overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8555.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8556.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the CPA increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8558.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8560.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8562.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear spins it easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8567.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'm gonna say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8569.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear, we talked about busing now, lead in the water, teacher cuts, roads and sidewalks, because $500,000 is gonna fix road and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8580.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the most important thing I wanna talk about is what's happening in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8584.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you watch what's happening in social media, the teachers union, the MTA, has never ever, as one person that was on the negotiating team and a former member, has never ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8599.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ruled on or endorsed a candidate or a question, because we knew as union members that our impact's not gonna hurt just, it's not gonna help us, but it's gonna hurt other unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8611.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they did the right thing by staying neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8616.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe they believe in it, maybe they don't, but they said, let's be, let's stay neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8620.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And shame on this community that have turned their backs on teachers saying, the comments I've been seeing, like this is the teacher's fault?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8628.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't the teacher's fault, this is the administration's fault to set up this fear tactic and set up this negativity to divide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8636.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8639.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I want everything we can get for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8642.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our students and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8646.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8649.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's options with new growth as we come down the line, but we can correct it right now without hurting renters, landlords, senior citizens, our people that are most vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8659.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use that free cash, make it whole and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8665.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore you, please, think about what you've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8669.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's concrete, common sense information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8672.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9184.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, Councilor, to clarify a little something, I think that what I've heard from residents is the chronic misrepresentation and the lack of true transparency<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9198.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is what causes the community to distrust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9203.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9205.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's truly what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9207.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you hear and see how we got to this point, this is what caused it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9214.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The misinformation, the confusion, the uncertainty for the people that are most vulnerable, our children, our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9226.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the issue that we should be focusing on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9229.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and thinking that an override is the answer, or, ready for this one, $500,000 are gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9237.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9239.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's look at, now I've heard that 20 times tonight, that $500,000 is gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9244.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the big picture of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9246.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW, the mayor is firing DPW workers hand over fist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9252.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have equipment at DPW that we have members that haven't been trained because they don't know how to be trained on new equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9261.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a mayor that's spending so much money on legal fees and legal settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9269.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're using, the mismanagement of funds in this community has hurt us to the point that here we are, that some council is saying, hey, since we haven't done it ever, let's do it, which is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9283.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'd love to see us do this the right way from the schools with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9290.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's go to the table and see what we truly need with a true financial team open to the public that it's shared with everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9299.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9456.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't understand her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9457.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't hear her question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9466.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9467.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9468.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we sat and talked at the meeting in April, May, and June, I came forth with the proposal of a resolution of using free cash of the $25 million that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9483.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was Councilor, when I brought it forth, it was Councilor Leming that used Rule 21, which froze<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9491.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the future discussions of that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9494.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as it went through and you could see in the videos, as we went through that process, they kept using tactics where we couldn't speak or have open forums before we went to a vote in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9506.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these are issues that when I say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9511.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we need to eliminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9512.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to sit together as a community and say, okay, what do we work with the state and work with our assessor and say, hey, let's understand the impact at an early enough stage so we can be prepared for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9524.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see if we can look at true exemptions that would help our landlords or senior citizens<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9529.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or our most vulnerable community members, then let's look at it and say, what do we really need and make sure that our children in our schools have everything that they're asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9539.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that with that process being open, I don't think we wouldn't be able to deny anything, but the way the process has come out and the way that's been spun saying, Councilor Scarpelling wants no because he doesn't want that, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9555.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is the way this process has gone about from 2023 in June till today has been a total farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9563.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9564.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9566.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council can say what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9568.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These fair tactics are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9570.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9571.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not making it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9572.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them all say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9574.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's whether it's whether it's streets falling in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9578.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, even the mayor said the other day was sitting on a 200 million dollar time bomb called our water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9584.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9585.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if we did our job with ARPA, that's what that money was made for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9590.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to save your key, sir, because you had no new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9593.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10069.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10070.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10071.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This councilor has not said once that we should use free cash year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10076.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I said right now is eliminate the fear for our senior citizens, our children, our teachers for one time to level fund this and look at other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know where this keeps coming back and forth and understand an override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10094.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was said by another financial director in another community, he said to me, George, remember, using an override to do what you're trying to do in Medford, it's like using your credit card to pay for your mortgage or pay for your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10105.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10107.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a right way to go through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10109.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different situations that we talk about and we said, okay, you know, Medford has drastically underfunded so many processes when you look at our receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10122.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10123.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see that our circuit breaker has increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10128.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen that we use the Fair Amendment Act for Chapter 70, our increase of $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10136.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a lot that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10138.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of money in the city that we're not using correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10144.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10145.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, just to have the fact that you have $9 million of free cash at the end of the year, your budget season, to get certified, that just speaks volumes of mismanagement of fiscal funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10159.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, when you sit there and you set that budget, that budget is set, let's say 100 million, and then you only spend 90 million, that means you didn't do something right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10173.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means you didn't use that money appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10176.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the city's taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10180.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I say free cash, of course it's not free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10183.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's our money that we've already paid the year before to balance our budget, to make our city run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10226.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simon, thank you for coming up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10229.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so impressed with you coming to this podium, because there are so many scaredy cat adults, but you have the guts to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10235.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you for that, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10237.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have family members that might be your teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10241.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have children that went through the schools just like you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10245.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's scary right now, because you're listening to grownups talk about, we're gonna cut positions, we're gonna hurt teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10252.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the intent, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10254.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a solution that's easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10257.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use money that the city has saved, that can fix it right now, instead of going to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10263.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that Mr. Scarpelli asked for years, months and months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10267.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you come to this point, my friend, you have to understand, we wanna make sure that every single one of your teachers are back next year, because you know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10276.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10278.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10950.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10952.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To your point, Mr. Rodriguez, I think that this is why question eight, again, this is why these questions are so vague, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10959.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That people are confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10960.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because the determination of this $4 million is so we can align the vocational school building with the high school building so we can increase the day, so we can provide programming for both levels, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10974.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10977.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10978.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10980.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where is the money gonna go when it's not even entertained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10986.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10988.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question that's $4 million, the state expert and former superintendent of Medford, Roy Belson, stated, if during negotiations, that's what we're looking for is to line those bells, then it's negotiations for the high school and vocational school teachers to increase their rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11013.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Realistically, you're looking at $600,000 when you're looking to do that group, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11018.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $4 million for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11021.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we've said, more arts programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11024.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have art programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11026.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue is aligning the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11028.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In programming, we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11029.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just gotta line the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11032.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's so wide open to say $4 million to do arts and to align this process with the vocational school and the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11042.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is so vague, how can we even entertain voting on it when we know the ramifications to the rest of the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11051.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11055.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hear what was being said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11057.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open-ended questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11059.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that people don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11063.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have FOIA requests that show that there was no proper discussions with school department members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11069.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the school department isn't part of this financial task force for an override, and then a question like question eight comes up, it's so vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11077.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11078.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure that we need an override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11184.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where does it say that though?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11185.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's eloquent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11187.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You would have to look at it if it was presented that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11190.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11191.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11192.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11737.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11741.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11743.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I missed most of the question, Bill, but again, like we're saying, we're hearing a systemic issue that's been happening for years, but the way the process, and I'll say again, the way the process has come forth, the way the process has come full circle right now, it's putting so many people, so many residents in flux and fear, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11765.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11767.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the way that we've moved forward, that this group has moved forward to present an out, that really isn't an out like they've said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11776.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not gonna really help, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11779.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where the money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11780.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things are still questioned for each question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11783.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not certainties, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11786.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already heard from everybody that hasn't been part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11790.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, why continue this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11794.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why keep moving forward and understanding that we're hurting real people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11797.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting real residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11800.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I said, I like, again, I'm talking about the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11803.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about the seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11804.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11805.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11807.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting a lot of people right now for something that quote unquote is so minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11814.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the truth of the matter is, this is so minimal and such cause such divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11819.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're now seeing is, are we truly gonna look at the next question when we really need it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11825.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or are we gonna look at it with caution and saying, I'm definitely gonna stand against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11833.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll use a $200 million, $400 million high school down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11838.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine if that process was done, how it would destroy homeowners right now, senior citizens, people on fixed incomes, it would destroy us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11847.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this process has to be done in a better way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11849.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It shouldn't be done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11852.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11926.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think if I can, Mr. President, I think when we've heard parents of the fear, right, that we're going to cut, I believe one school can remember saying it was 55 to 65 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11938.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it was now 35 and the pain, the fear is going to be spread all over, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11945.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's going to feel the pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11947.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the comment that's gone out publicly by that school committee remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11950.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11951.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what you're saying to this is saying that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11955.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we gonna cut, a teacher's gonna be cut in January, January 2025, if the override fails in November?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11963.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a question, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11964.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11966.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know because in these questions, these override questions, you didn't say to cover the cost of 55 to 65 teachers that will be cut, not a question seven or question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11977.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11979.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that again leads to another example of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11985.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure we know what we're voting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11987.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are we sure we need to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11991.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And was this transparent enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12003.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12004.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, everyone, where's Simon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12007.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your teachers aren't going to be cut this year, because that's the word going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12011.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word was at these meetings now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They will not be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be no cuts until next fiscal year, next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12017.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But next fiscal year, we'll have more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12018.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12019.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12020.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll give us time, because we had an opportunity, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12023.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an opportunity back in 2023, when we realized that we were using ARPA and ESSER funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12031.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to balance a budget of operations which you shouldn't that we know that but this council voted on a backroom deal that that's what happened and then they've moved forward with this financial task force so here we are right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12042.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 1.7 so all right so this is where we are right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12047.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh I apologize... so this is... Thank you, I apologize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12716.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12717.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let's start off by the teachers and compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12720.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A good way to make sure they go is scare them with layoffs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12726.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you have an avenue to save them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12729.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with this question, the truth of the matter is, in most communities, it's growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12734.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Growth, growth, growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12736.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth, smart development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12737.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12739.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened in neighboring communities like Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12741.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the pandemic, what happened in Everett, what happened in Malden, you saw new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12747.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard my council colleagues say that it'll take us five to seven years to see that wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12751.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had three 40B projects that not only would bring in valuable funding through permits and fees, and then the new tax base, but also open up an opportunity for what we lack here is affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12768.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this mayor has voided that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12770.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, just one project, and I'll say it over and over again, because we've talked to the owner of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12776.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He put in a place for 40B projects, 400 units at the old gold gym site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12781.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 to $5 million just in permits would have come right to us, right away, $3 to $5 million for one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12787.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you would see an increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12789.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once that's built, you would then have a tax base of more to $6 to $9 million coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12797.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now what you saw is the mayor fight that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12800.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is a 40B project, which you can't fight and win in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12803.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12804.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She takes it to court, they lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12806.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then she brings it back and she appeals it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12810.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we're paying lawyers, we lose the appeal, but at the same time, we now have these developers that have walked away to Medford because now they're in Watertown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12819.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're in other neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12821.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this gentleman just lost $5 million by sitting on a property, hoping he could develop Medford the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12827.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece we have right now, the mayor is, did everybody hear this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12830.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an RFP for five spots in Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12834.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12836.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12837.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is again, lack of transparency and openness in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12840.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13095.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if I can, I think there's more involved here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13101.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's very clear and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13103.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the communities can see that our firemen and women do not want this override or this debt exclusion because it hurts our citizenry because the design and the building that they're looking to build is not adequate for any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13117.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have a firefighter standing in front of us that, so we all understand why we're in fiscal crisis, why we're in fiscal issues, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13127.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Firefighter Masolino wrote a grant for 11 firefighters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13131.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through FEMA, so the FEMA would pay these 11 firefighters for three years, as long as you didn't vary from those 11 firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13142.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, at the end, the only caveat is you have to sustain those 11 firefighters to be at minimal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13150.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, no, we'll only fund five or seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13154.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just by doing that, guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13156.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It voided the 11 firefighters that would have been paid for FEMA for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13162.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council, the mayor had a outside member doing evaluation to come in, and we spent $10,000 to start with this firefighter evaluator to come in and look at the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13177.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have yet to hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13179.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I hear, that person's been gone now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13181.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No report, no nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13183.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we see, the mismanagement of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13186.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not that we don't have, in certain cases, enough funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13190.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's how you manage those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13192.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you for everything you do, and we should not vote support this override, because our firefighters are saying, let's not hurt our residents, especially if it's an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13206.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll stay where we are, even though it's disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13210.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14012.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate the question because I too have a stance on this and it's difficult when your kids are reading posts and saying, hey dad, why are they using you for supporting constituents and residents that feel like they're being not listened to, to racist or a member of KKK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14034.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's pretty sad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14036.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see these situations of division,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14039.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's because people feel they haven't been heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14043.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I welcome you to look at the videos from our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14046.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had viable questions in our meetings, and this is where the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14050.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you try to bring these questions forward and this council actively shut you down, as a member of this community and a city councilor, to be disrespected like that, opened up so many people's eyes to say, is this something that's been, is it needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14067.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's a group of people, my friend, that aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14071.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're afraid that no one's listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14075.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that could be corrected, I've said this a thousand times, I never said I didn't want a debt exclusion, or the side, even the All-Method group saying that they didn't want a debt exclusion, all they're saying is, let's have a more open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14087.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard so many questionable issues tonight, from the firefighters' designs, to question seven and eight, there's so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14094.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the problem right now is you have six councils that really look at something and an issue and they band together, but they leave a whole demographic out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14102.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They can say the fluffy words to say that, well, it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14106.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're saying it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14107.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Words that some people use is divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14109.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is if it's smell, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14114.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and people just watch and see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14116.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want division either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14118.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's too much division in this whole country, in this whole world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14121.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love for us to sit together, but as a councilor, when you're trying to share an opinion for a group of constituents that feel that they're not being listened to, that they feel like they're not being listened to, then you bring that forward, and then they actively shut you down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14137.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They use council rules against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14139.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They suspend council rules so you can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14142.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14144.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14146.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because people didn't feel like they were properly listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14149.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't feel like this financial task force was actually transparent and open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14152.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if they were, and the mayor presented all the facts, maybe we'd be in a different place right now, but we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14160.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we made a lot of mistakes on many sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14989.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that when you left, no one could say this publicly, but we wanna thank you because we know how difficult your job is anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14995.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand becoming a chief is very difficult because you have been thrown into the realm of politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15001.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's sad because I know who you are as a man and I know how much you love being a firefighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15006.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll be honest with you, I was sad to hear that you did step away because Medford is worse as a fire department because you're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15014.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna make sure publicly somebody said that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15016.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Danielle doesn't want to say it, but I've heard it over and over again through public, through social media, our leader of the community, through social media, bashing on you, bashing on other fire chiefs, saying it's all them, that they've been part of the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15032.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I need to know, when you left, were our firefighters involved in that design that we have today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15340.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15341.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15346.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Clarification, thank you with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15347.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also know that from what I've heard, it's 1,000 square feet smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15352.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you want to talk about unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15354.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about doing something correct as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15356.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking about firefighters, that their safety with carcinogens aren't being met, I think in unity, we should all say that we do not support this debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15367.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's inadequate for our men and women in the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15370.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I think we should say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15372.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to start in that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15374.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15375.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Chief, thank you so much for the clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15377.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that our firefighters aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16519.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16521.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So very simply put is, I've been saying this for months now, is that it's a one-time correction with the free cash to eliminate any fear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16532.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and disruption to our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16536.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been saying for years that in the last five years, we've had zero new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16542.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you talk about new growth, that is the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16546.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The solution to any community's investment in finances is their new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16552.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in the city of Medford to hang our hats on other than a beer hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16560.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen anything bring in true funding other than a beer haul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16566.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, I've been pretty consistent with what I've been saying, but although you don't wanna look at transparency, I think that's the major issue right now is because the word, the information is not getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16579.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're voting on something that we've shown so many different reasons why we shouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16585.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16586.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many people, actual people that are gonna get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16591.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that to have a solution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16593.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's using free cash once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16596.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People keep saying that I'm saying that we do this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16600.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do this once because this community had over $35 million, over $34 million of free cash that we could have used and then sat together in an open process to see what we can do together as a total community to see what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16619.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16620.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, new growth and development is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16625.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the way that our budget was underfunded in certain aspects, but underappreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16633.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have to look at so many different options in the future, but what we lacked and the reason why we're here is because our mayor and our administration use one-time funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16647.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to carry her water for the last five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16652.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=808.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=810.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Larry Lepore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=813.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: someone we should all celebrate to know and be honored that he was our friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=818.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a while since you take that ride down Main Street and you notice his car's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=826.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At Alexander's, one of his favorite spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=831.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or the knock on your door and just so he can pat my dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=835.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or sometimes he would sneak away because he knew Dina was coming with Biscotti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=844.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he would always be so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=847.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we hear over and over about Larry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=852.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He never let politics get in the way of anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=857.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just such a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=859.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if you had a bad day, he'd tell you, he'd lend you that word that you're doing the job that people elected you to do and made you feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=874.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whatever you felt in yourself that it was the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=878.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=882.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to miss him so much because I think a lot of us, even though if you didn't know Larry long, it's amazing how you captured his spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=895.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even a night like tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=898.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, he'd look at me and we'd make eye contact with some stupid comment I'd make and I'd feel, oh, I owe him something later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=907.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or when someone would come up and they'd say something silly and he'd look at me with this like, are you kidding me type of face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=915.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he never did it with disrespect or without honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=919.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was such a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=921.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know the cancer that he fought at the end was very tough, very painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=929.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=936.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2400.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2402.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you said that if this job, from what I gather, if this, if we don't find a resolution, National Grid walks away and there is ramifications, like you said, could you explain that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2418.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there is a power outage with this piece being, you know, non-functioning that, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2425.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What part of the community is going to be affected if that's the case?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2460.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so hypothetically, if we don't move forward with this, there's a power outage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2467.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Parts of South Medford are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2485.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that situation, does that then facilitate an emergency service?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2490.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2496.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and then, if, Mr. O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2503.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we pay then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2525.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then the rule is still up for interpretation, still have to hop the car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2531.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=587.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=588.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=590.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work, but I think that one of the questions that I've been, um, that I've, I've received from the constituents is that when we wrote this RFP, we're getting to the point where, um, the question is down to a rise that is, is that we need to be answered is that when we wrote the RFP and we asked for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=610.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, in this to be the that were awarded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=613.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were talking about the process of going into the neighborhoods that our zoning changes would be affected so we can have our citizenry be part of that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=624.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, are we planning on doing that before we go to a city council final vote as we move<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=631.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: forward because that's something that was um stressed pretty pretty strongly when we discussed it with the prior city council so uh again i appreciate the hard work but i've been waiting uh to ask this question for the simple fact that it's what was intended when we first started the process so thank you thank you so much Councilor i really appreciate that question um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=775.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor as a city council, I have a question and for you to deny that question for city staff is a serious issue, Madam Vice President, because I have a follow up to the question that you asked because I asked a specific question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=789.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The specific question I asked was when we asked to write the RFP and if I'll bring up the minutes, we will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=796.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we asked that we were going to take this directly to the neighborhoods and have an open discussion in those neighborhoods with open dialogue and meetings to get everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=807.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=808.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council is working on the transparency factor of what you think is correct, not what we decided on as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=818.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't disrespect me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=821.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't do that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=821.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done it three times tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=823.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=825.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=870.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=877.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=878.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's important as as make it make it to be clear that I've I've gone to listen to every meeting, gone to every meeting, and this is under the meeting preference that we're waiting on the process that was originally planned and the RFP that this will be taking to the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=897.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't answered that question yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=899.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=900.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that we've had open dialogue that we've done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=903.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=904.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I want to make it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=906.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Councilor hasn't brought this forward because I've been waiting for the process to walk through to see when is the plan and to go into the neighborhoods because that was the original discussion, Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=917.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=918.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1269.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to the election commissioners and they said that these rules are all posted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1275.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at City Hall and the election in the elections office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1277.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if anybody does need some clarity that the election office does have all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1283.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1731.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you like to read that first, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1930.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for Mrs. Tomaszczuk bringing forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1931.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've talked to a few of our friends in the audience and I think there was some confusion first that people seem to thought it was about the pop-up park, but it's not about the pop-up park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1943.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issues and concerns are something that we'll hear again later on tonight is that the way we're doing business in Medford is that we're really not getting the community involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1955.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they wanna say the community gets involved, but the truth of the matter is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1961.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me ask our seniors if we know that we have valuable land here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1966.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, I think there has to be an understanding that we need some growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1972.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if there was a partnership where we brought the process to the seniors and said, this is how we're going to look at the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1982.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wanna make sure that all of your concerns are taken care of and get your input so you can share what you're afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1991.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and making sure that we fill those gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1994.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure none of you have had that conversation with anybody from the city, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1997.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1999.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so this is what we're seeing right now in Medford, is that as we're going through our zoning changes, one thing we talked about was really going into the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2009.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We put that in the RFP actually, about when we rezone, when we look at projects like this, we go into those communities, just like neighbor communities do when they do big projects like Assembly Row,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2019.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and they do big projects like Union Square in Somerville, they actually bring city staff to the neighborhood where people come out and talk to you and you can share your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2029.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping moving forward by coming to this podium, there is an issue, there is a concern, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2037.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna say that we don't need new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2040.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna say that, I won't lie to you and tell you that I don't think that we need to use these parcels<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2046.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make a change to really invest in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2049.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, what we need is an understanding and a form of partnership where our seniors can say, okay, if you're going to take this lot, what lot are we going to build<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2064.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to make sure that it's similar vicinity that our seniors can park and walk across the street or walk next door so we can accommodate all of the programs that you said are so important to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2076.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think moving forward, I think that we have a, you know, I hear you loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2082.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm going to advocate to make sure that as we move forward, especially with this RFP and these five parcels I heard that I think it's three, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2090.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also told there was maybe five that are coming down the line that it's going to encompass the whole square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2095.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to see drastic changes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2098.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like we're forgetting the most vulnerable people in our community, mostly our seniors, and saying, well, let's just move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2106.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2108.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll share my information, my phone number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2110.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you feel fear in any way, give me a call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2113.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me at least try to be a voice as we go through this process, because unfortunately, it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that it could happen with a partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2123.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everybody's involved to make sure that all the concerns that you have are addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2129.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're not going to sleep thinking, are we going to lose the grieving program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2132.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to lose the knitting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2134.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to lose this program because there's nowhere to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2137.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2138.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to share that with you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2141.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that from what I've talked to a few of the seniors offline, and I think after this conversation I shared with them, they felt a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2151.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that we really need a buy-in from the city administration to work with our seniors, not just bring you cookies and pizza on election week, but really sit down with you and say, hey, what do you really need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2162.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And making sure that your needs are met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2164.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just just a point of information maybe some clarity for the planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3226.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the question that was reported back to me that part of the RP that the mentioned the mayor mentioned was that it was a looking at 40 spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3236.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the new developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3237.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that doesn't even come close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3239.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is why having this conversation is a beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3243.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's before it gets too late because we're down the line with other projects in the city that our community hasn't been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3252.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say community, it's having those meetings at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3258.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you set a vision of what you want this to look like, what you want Medford Square to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3262.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is where you bring in the business community, because some business members that were at that chamber meeting, really, they weren't very excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3269.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's some question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3270.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's why you have these meetings open to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3273.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you sit there with all the department heads, your planning department, your recreation department, your fire department, your police department, because there's so many things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3282.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you look at development that have to be considered, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3286.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we, if we build this many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3288.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we bring in this many people, are we going to have the infrastructure DPW can carry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3293.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we build it, bring in this many people, are we going to have enough police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3296.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we going to have fire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3298.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's so many, so many, and I only speak on this on as, as, as person who does this as a department head in the past, I worked for municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3307.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we do is before, before the city came out and just started giving out RFPs and getting the idea of the developers, because that's the problem with Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3317.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we bring the developers in to get their idea first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3319.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't that, that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3321.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the issue is in other communities what happens is you bring your stakeholders in first with the plans that were were derived that Medford has spent millions of dollars on that dust some of those off and say well these plans say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3335.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where do you feel and what do you fit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3337.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the first thing we see is our senior citizens have already come out and said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3340.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're scared that we're going to be overlooked and bypassed because one of the basic necessities we have is parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3348.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that could be something that you look at at a meeting like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3352.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping that the mayor really, really readjust and understand the process when it comes to the December proposals that come in, that we reassess again and look at the true process of true development and true input from our community, where we bring the meeting to you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3370.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not somewhere that you have to find one, you have to find where this meeting is and then go out and look for it and then not have the proper people in that can answer the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3378.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But neighboring communities, what they do is they bring everybody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3381.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So every question is answered right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3384.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then we could set up a comprehensive plan that involves all the stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3390.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that means that not everybody's gonna be happy with some of the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3395.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but at least they can look at outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3397.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one of the things we talked about in my neighboring community was it was affecting the process for one of our senior areas in Union Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3405.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So part of the deal was that we would have a shuttle system in place that would be built in with the developers that we don't need senior citizens who didn't need the parking in that area for it was identified for a small group, I think it was 50 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3420.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they looked at how they would shuttle the seniors in, and that was part of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3426.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's being creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3428.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's at least giving you an option to give you calm and understand that people are looking out for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3435.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a friend that came up to the podium said that our seniors are afraid that we're being forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3441.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3443.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard that in the last, especially three months in the process, we're seeing what's happening on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3449.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We hear you, at least I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3451.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to really put our money where our mouth is and really start opening up the dialogue with the most vulnerable members of our community, unfortunately, which are our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3460.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Bearsley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3512.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the concern with that response was that not everybody is getting informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3519.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I'm hearing from everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3521.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might just check a box and say, we're having a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3524.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I understand the comprehensive plans that have been going on for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3526.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We spend millions of dollars on it, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3528.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, especially firsthand from our seniors, is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3533.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people are getting surveyed that then they say there's a survey of people say they've been spoken to people said there were meetings, but no one really knows when it seems like just a certain group understands against this message, because the average person, and you can look at what we have here in the auditorium today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3549.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're not getting the message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3550.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if that's the case, Council President, we need to do a better job as a community and a leadership in the city is to educate all of our members of our community so they can get involved with these processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3562.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4591.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4591.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Council, let me bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4594.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this is the outside the box thinking that we need to protect that most vulnerable, especially when you talk about the times we're in today so I and I think that Council saying is correct I think that what might help some people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4606.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, there are some people out there that'll question everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4609.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the city assessor could really support us by showing how the tax levy is, how many, if we looked at how many veterans needed the support and what that would look like and who would carry the brunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4625.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think if you asked nine out of 10 residents that we can support our seniors, I mean, our veterans,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4635.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and helping them through this process, I think that it would be supported wholeheartedly, but I think it would be good just to see that number, because I don't think it'd be drastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4646.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4808.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4810.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed that our, um, the consultant that this body approved its funding, um, has finished their assessment and has presented to the chief and his leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4825.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing that I found, um, that really struck me is that back in September, um, maybe the fire, um, our partners from the method fight apartment can help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4838.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4839.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, I know the mayor spoke on a podcast that mentioned the consultant directly and stating some pretty damaging wordage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4852.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would imagine that that letter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4855.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is public and is part of this body's purview to overview and use that input to help our residents, especially when they come up to Tuesday's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4867.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the Chief's here, and I know that President Marcellino's here from the Firefighters Union, and I know that, I believe the mayor used the consultant's words, she said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4879.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If she didn't fix the culture dysfunction with the fire department that someone could get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4884.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something she used to support her efforts, moving against anything to deal with the fire department but I think that that's something that is alarming to me when I heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4894.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4896.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the consultant is completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4898.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest issues that we're hearing right now and discrepancies that we're hearing from both the fire, um, firefighters themselves, the fire union who have come out publicly and chief Freeman, who was here the other day that spoke openly about the design of the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4917.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4919.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how people want to look at the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4921.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's one side or the other, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4923.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there should be only one side, and that's what we need in our community for our fire station, the best design possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4930.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I would imagine that, and correct me if I'm wrong, maybe Chief Evans can come up, that the pot of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4939.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: discussion must have been around a new design of a headquarters and getting some information out to the public, whether it's a, I know we're very popular with press releases, but really sharing any information that's given through a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4955.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: third party per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4956.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the yes group, it's not the no group, it's a third party that's come into the city and done an evaluation that the mayor has requested that this council has paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4965.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would hope that we can get that information out before the election on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4970.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know a lot of people have already gone out and voted, but I think that understanding what a consultant might think of that design might play a huge factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4978.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, if it's the fact that there isn't any information in those documents about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4985.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the design, then I stand corrected and we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4990.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it would be interesting to see if that was part of that consultant's purview to share their opinion when it comes to our main street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5001.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fire department and it's designed for a new station because I know that a lot of people right now are in flux whether they're going to support it or not and if it's something that comes out and says no there are some design that he does support what the administration is saying that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5018.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All perfect and it's ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5020.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the chief supported it through the letter that the mayor read in her blog or her report that it's definitely that he supports the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5031.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that having a party that is an outside specialist, I'd like to see if maybe the chief or anybody from the union has heard anything that can help us get that word out to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5047.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5090.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it could be released, especially with the election coming up in November about support or not supporting the fire design of the project, that if the consultant had information that we can share before the election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5133.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's nothing in the design that consultants about their thought of the design?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5142.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I don't know what I'm just saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5144.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's not, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5144.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5146.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I would do if we can, um, as well as, uh, appreciate that, that eliminates any, um, any, any thought process of trying to answer some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5156.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that if we can, Mr. President, that we do motion that we have, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5162.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if the consultant can come out later on after this as soon as we can to really review all of the findings with this council and if it needs to be to go to executive session that we go to an executive session because I know we as a council had some questions about having the fire department and talking with them about some concerns and maybe opening up executive session for them as well so I would put that in a form of a motion and hopefully we can do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5190.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before before the new year if we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5192.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5204.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that the chief has answered that, that there's nothing in the report that, you know, I thought that that might be interesting to see if a third party had some initial thoughts on that in the report, but if they don't, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5217.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's now we know if they don't, if we could just rephrase that, Mr. President, that we call for a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5223.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um a meeting uh before the new year it doesn't have to be right away now with the fire department and um the consultant to review their findings thank you got it so i would amend the resolution to um remove the question about the fire headquarters and then change it to requesting to attend a future council meeting to explain the findings perfect thank you mr president got it do you have that amendment mr clerk<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5609.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council Collins for leading our zoning team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5613.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5615.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: agreed 1000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5617.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5618.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we've been looking, looking into this for so many years but I just again, I bring forth the understanding that of course we've had a lot of meetings, we can see that there's been plenty of meetings but one of the things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5631.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we made sure with the past council that we really made sure that we tried to incorporate the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5639.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you could say that we've had these meetings been open up to everybody and this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5644.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what we talked about when we started the RFP process back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5648.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: back many many years ago the conversation really was and I hope there's still time to do this is bringing the meetings to those neighborhoods and getting the input from our citizenry and with a comprehensive plan together with all the departments together and getting the vision of what everybody wants to do and making sure that all of the needs are going to be met in that neighborhood<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5672.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I revert to the RFP that was written and the scope of work that it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5681.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: public outreach the consultant will develop a public outreach strategy designed to inform the community stakeholders and the general public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5689.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The strategy and design was brought up into the fact that what we were doing in Somerville as a department leader that really shined the light and made everybody feel like stakeholders<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5704.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember these meetings specifically that we all understood and agreed that going into these meetings, sitting down as a team, looking to see what everybody wants in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5714.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about my process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5716.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about how recreation played a process when we wanted to look at Union Square and how that process was derived and how it was built together with stakeholders at those meetings in their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5728.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've had a thousand meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5730.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that people have been informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5732.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not what we asked for as a council a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5736.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what part of the RFP was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5738.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll state the comment that was made in a meeting when we were deciding this and we were talking about this in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5746.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli said, he thinks the most important thing in the community's input is community-based meetings, meaning in that zoning community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5755.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is something that I'm making up because I wanna be negative or I don't wanna do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5761.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna move forward with it, because I think we need to move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5764.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same vein, we have the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5767.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been talking with the people from Salem Street, and they feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5772.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's talked to them, no one sat with them in their backyard at the Roberts, like we did in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5778.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We go right in their yard, go to the Roberts Elementary School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5781.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You bring the neighbors there and say, okay, this is a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5783.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking to redevelop part of Salem Street to 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5788.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if you ask the people on Salem Street today, no one was really informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5792.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one really understood the process and no different what we're hearing on Mr. Cav.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5796.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5799.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5800.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we need the reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5802.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've supported this from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5804.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we do need is the truth of what hasn't been done, and that's what was written in the RFP, to have community-based meetings to involve the areas that are being rezoned to get their input and make them feel like they're part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5817.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not all of a sudden they come in and say, well, there's 12 stories coming up and we really weren't part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5824.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, no, we've had 36 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5825.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we've had 36 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5827.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm telling you again, when we talk about surveys, and I'll use Carr Park as an example, when they did Carr Park over, we talked to Alicia saying that everybody was surveyed in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5839.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I live a few streets away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5840.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5841.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I asked my neighbors, no, they weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5843.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing the same thing as we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5845.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, this is the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5846.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we could still catch this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5849.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But all I implore to my council colleagues<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5853.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to do what was asked in the RFP and I'll make a motion to revisit or ask for the plan that associates must have because it's part of the scope of work of what they viewed envisioned of what the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5868.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the community outreaches because to me, we're not reaching them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5872.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, like I said, I'm going to support this because I think it needs to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5876.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same vein, before it gets too into the process, we really need to start having these community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5882.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really need to start informing our residents more about being part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5888.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're not shocked two years down the line when all of a sudden their neighborhood has changed so drastically that they can't live there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5896.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6034.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for myself so I can share this with the community is what that breakdown really means for the community input one on ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6043.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think that that would be important to Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6045.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, I don't think it will be a concern or an issue or a violation to bring the meetings into neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6054.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done this in the past many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6056.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I think that that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6059.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that wouldn't be a hindrance at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6061.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate the words, but again, I do think that we should do more, like you said, and maybe outreaching and doing something in their communities, in those neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6073.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7730.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7732.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it me you're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7733.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7736.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, I know that recently I saw, I think it was a Stoneham truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7755.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's great with the fire department in your world that we can reach out to our brothers and sisters from neighboring communities to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7762.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that my thing is that I know that as we look forward to the capital plan that the mayor put out, we know we have two trucks coming, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7772.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that there were questions last year that we wanted to order two more, but if we didn't do it a certain time, it would be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7781.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: drastic, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7782.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what is I know the two are coming in 20 is it 2026?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7798.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so it looks like we need some band aids to get us through these first two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7803.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that do you know when the plan is for the other two was part of our 14 plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7809.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7810.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, that if we can, Mr. President, as part of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7814.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just get an update on the mayor's capital plan about the I know that we wanted to but waiting for two more fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7821.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think because if we keep we keep band aiding and keep it'll be no different than what we're seeing with the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7836.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's only so much bubble gum and duct tape that we can purchase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7840.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that these are serious issues and making sure our firefighters have, you know, it'd be funny if everybody jumps into Bobby's oil truck to go fight a fire because we don't have a truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7853.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think that I completely understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7859.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're going with this and it's if it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7863.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand but I have other questions but I yield to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8312.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8374.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Due to the situation with the override on November 5th, I would invoke rule 21<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8381.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to move this to the next meeting after the override for the fact that without understanding the true emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8398.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would invoke rule 21 and move this to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8401.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8548.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8549.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8551.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you define paper way so people can understand what that means, because a lot of people like where's paper way in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8558.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we can just explain that a little bit that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8635.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's out of necessity, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8637.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because of some structural issues to Joseph's way, is that what I'm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8683.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8686.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks pretty dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8687.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=938.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resolution stated that it go to governance committee to discuss COLA raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=945.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now it's that, so in essence, this is saying that the city council shouldn't be voting for their own raises and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=954.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=955.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1027.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if I can, because I received numerous calls, as you can imagine, because the way it read really alarmed a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1036.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been a very trying week, both on the national level and also in the local level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1043.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And part of the discussions and making sure that the residents know is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1049.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, after such a close vote and half of the community split over the override and so much contention still left in the community to divide the fact that we had elected officials, especially the mayor dancing in celebration that half of the community is going to be in pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1066.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, to add this, the next day was so, you know, for the next meeting was very, very touching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1072.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1073.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just I don't know where this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1075.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have our own ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1076.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have our own rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1078.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like the way I read it is someone maybe talked to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1082.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your friends might have talked to you and told you don't do this the day after an override vote because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1088.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this community needs a lot to heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1091.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in the process that we went through and the questions we had with the original raise, I don't even understand why this is on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1097.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would imagine you should rule it out of order, Mr. President, just for the fact that, as you already stated, these are things that we've already had in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1105.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, as as the senior member of this council and understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1110.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know historically why people join this council in the past is really being part of the community and looking at this position as a full-time position should never be looked at a full-time not Medford maybe in a major city but in the city of Medford to even look at a salary adjustment in any way to move forward I think it's totally disingenuine especially the week that we had last week so I would um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1135.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My I will know anyway, but I would hope that this would be ruled out of order and disperse because this doesn't say anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1144.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It said something early that really riled the whole community up and then looking for a cola when we have we have departments that haven't gotten a raise in years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1155.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1155.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have city departments that go three years without raises or colds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1160.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was something that just to let you know, this is what I'm saying this out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1164.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the people that are watching because they were very interested in what was being said tonight that to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1171.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to review this isn't, hopefully this isn't asking for any sort of Kohler adjustment like other communities or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1180.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until we take care of our own here, I think that we should stay away from this completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1184.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Stay away from any money paper when it's talking about funding this council a penny more after fiscal crisis and what we went through on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1192.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1602.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would you say that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1603.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not part of any group, I'm a member of many groups, but to say that you use my name in that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1611.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can use the best metrics in so many different ways that this person did, and just embarrass my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1624.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't send anything out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1626.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1629.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1631.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a meeting, tell them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1672.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The comments that have been said around this oval that we're talking about, these are conversations I've had with people that have reached out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1680.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what was said, what was written in the original may be changed after someone woke up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1685.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But whereas the Medford School Committee recently went 24 years without a cost of living adjustment, COLA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1692.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now this starts to think, well, what does it say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1695.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're looking for COLA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1696.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions they asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1698.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: be it resolved that the governance committee take up the ordinance to disallow the city council from passing salary change to affected city officials, and to encourage the city council to consider regular color adjustments for elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1710.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1713.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say it wasn't for next year, but what I'm saying is the phone calls I received and the understanding that I'm trying to explain to my people, and if those people are my people, the ones that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1725.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the 60,000 that live in this community, those are those people that had those questions after a very contentious election cycle on Tuesday night, and then put this forward the way it was written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1738.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could spin it any way you want today, but that's how it was written, and that's why there were questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1744.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So any organization to put on email that spun anything anyway, take it for what it's worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1750.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this councilor over and over again, whenever I brought anything forward, have backed it up with video or specific instances that all of you have witnessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1762.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are makeup things that have been going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1766.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5369.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, to follow up with Councilor Collins, these are the initiatives that really show the community that we're really looking out for the best interest to our most vulnerable and our veterans sure are vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5384.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2678.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Leming, I believe there's a resident that has their hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3397.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chair Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3398.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all the hard work we're doing, and I know that I sound like a broken record, but I know as we move forward with, I know Director Hunt's on as well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3409.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know I read what we tried to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3413.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We originally, when we first started this process with the RFP for, um, zoning consultants and making sure that we brought these, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3424.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these steps to the neighborhoods and to the communities that were rezoning step-by-step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3431.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something I thought the former council really stressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3435.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it would help with, we can see lately a lot of misinformation going out and making sure that the right information goes out and going into those neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3448.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest concerns that I keep hearing is that, you know, Salem Street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3453.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is being rezoned for 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3455.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now I know we're, um, you know, we're saying no, but you have people out there that are spinning a dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3463.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have to make sure that, um, you know, I know that one thing that we asked for in the RFP when, and it's, um, applied for it was a comprehensive plan for, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3474.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: meeting with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3476.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we've said that we've had multiple meetings with in this setting, and I don't disagree, but again, I really would recommend that we look at that process and bring it to the neighborhoods where the neighborhoods can really share what they want their neighborhood to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3497.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think like we've talked about when we rezoned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3501.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: many as a as a department head in Somerville I was directly involved in the rezoning of different areas in the community where we use this example back a few years ago why we thought it was so important um chair Leming that we had um different city departments like recreation police fire um dpw where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3527.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as you put these plans out and these zoning reforms out, that people really felt that they were part of the process and they were helping design what their neighborhoods wanted to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3539.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can tell me I'm wrong, but I really would stress that we could follow through with that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3546.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3640.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, that, that's, that's, uh, that's if I can, Mr. No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3665.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize that I missed the beginning of the meeting, but as a fitting city council play again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3672.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, my import is is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3675.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is, uh, a piece that's coming from our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3678.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate council beers, uh, for, uh, expanding on those efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3684.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a, that's a great effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3686.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that going back to those residents that have reached out to me and let them know that that's coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3692.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's going to be super helpful as we move forward to make sure everybody feels like that's part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3697.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you very much for your leadership on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3838.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3839.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great information to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3841.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's where my problem comes in, Commissioner Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3845.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, when we did the RFP, we we knew our limitations in your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3853.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why we asked to put that in the RFP to bring in the capable staff of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3861.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it's to come in and work with those communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3865.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find it disheartening that we knew that this isn't a secret that we don't have enough staff in your office, but this is why we asked to be put in, and this is why it's written in the RFP as a comprehensive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3881.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: comprehensive plan for outreach for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3884.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate everything you've done way more than what we talked about the last couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3891.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3892.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm going to implore that we find a way to go into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3899.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3902.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: everybody has to have an opportunity to get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3907.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, I appreciate what Councilor Beaz is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3909.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate what your response was and how we're trying to get the information out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3915.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But believe it or not, there's still a big gap between the people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3921.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that would make it that would make an effort to come into their community and to their neighborhoods to talk about what their visions are to share those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3928.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again I know our limitations but again I revert back to our RFP where it's it says that it was and we were pretty clear when we started talking about the RFP as a council that this is the vision why and to all due respect um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3948.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all agreed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3950.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't think one person didn't agree that this is the type of format that we need to go into the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3955.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize to be a Debbie Downer, especially with some of the good information that we've heard tonight to get the information out, but I'm sorry, I still think that's not, it's not what we asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3969.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=28.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2664.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4264.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4264.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I will not try to match what Councilor Marks has said, because I said this the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4272.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what a Councilor does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4275.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Marks was ahead of this before anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4278.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He did his homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4279.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was thorough, and when he went to the meeting the other night, I was on that meeting, and I think it would have done a major disservice if I jumped in with what he's already done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4290.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're lucky to have him spearhead this effort because there are concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4296.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Knight also has done his homework, and I wanna leave what he's done to be presented by his expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4306.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm really focused on right now is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4310.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the understanding that I support Councilor Marks and every syllable he mentioned this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4317.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there is such confusion out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4320.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's coming from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4323.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's coming from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4326.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different department heads that who can do what, this is the city council's privy, this is the mayor's privy, so we'll clear that up, I believe, this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4335.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I do want to, if I can, there were department heads that were there the other night, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4341.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know, unfortunately I can't tell, is Tim McGivern or Alicia Hunt on the call right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4355.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4356.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that as Dave Rodriguez, the chief of staff, is he eligible to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4361.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I asked him a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4373.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4379.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Marks already brought this up, but I wanted to make sure that we had someone on the call today that we can implore to them that the biggest call that one of the biggest bothersome issues that came about was something this council has worked hard to do, and that's making sure that everybody is represented, that everybody has a chance to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4399.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we can go all the way back to the budget hearings last year that we had enough concerns that we didn't show up to a meeting because we wanted to make sure that there was a forum for everybody to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4410.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We worked hard, the council president worked hard with the administration to make sure we have people here that I will bet you a dollar for everyone that they wouldn't have had an opportunity to get on Zoom to express their concerns to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4424.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're in a safe manner, they're socially distancing, they're following through all the rules,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4429.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that brings me to the biggest question, the biggest issue I had with this, is that a department head mentioned that this, we've heard enough community participation and no one else can speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4449.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna make sure that the chief of staff and the department heads understand they're running this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4455.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that'll be there on Thursday,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4458.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know listen, we've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4460.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been the marathon meetings that lasted to one two o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4464.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4465.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4467.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is this affects everybody's just because it might not follow the telephone pole in front of your house doesn't mean that you can't listen to every concern of every citizen in our community because it matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4480.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because today it's in front of one person's home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4484.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like we talked about, they're expecting another 40, 50 who knows how many more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4489.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this scares a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4491.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are a lot of questions out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4493.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you, it just tells you how great the city of Medford is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4496.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I heard some great dialogue from some brilliant people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4502.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, the only people that were answering those questions were scientists, or managers, or people involved with Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4510.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Either they work for the construction companies that'll be doing the installation, they weren't directly, one of the questions, do you work with Verizon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4519.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was, no, I work for this company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4523.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's the company that puts in the towers for Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4526.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So technically, he's telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4529.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the issues that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4532.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why do we know that when communication can either help or hurt, with the lack of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4539.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few years back, a gentleman named Bill Carr Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4543.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: started a committee to build new fields behind Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4547.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what he did was he went out and secured a cell phone tower of over a million dollars to pay for those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4556.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was given every single hurdle to jump over, every single route to run through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4562.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest questions those neighbors had in the area, because everybody knows around the Medford High School area, there's absolutely zero cell space there, that no one can pick up a call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4575.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one of the number one cell areas in the country, we were told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4581.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did is we brought in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4583.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Educators and scientists from MIT and Tufts that we didn't pay, they came in on their own, brought in by the community members because they worked at MIT or worked at Tufts, and they brought these professionals in that really helped all the neighbors understand what the scenarios were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4604.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that, to be honest with you, it calmed a lot of people down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4608.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now, what I'm hearing now with hundreds of emails and phone calls is the lack of representation of an independent person, an independent scientist that are gonna give us a little more insight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4622.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, we heard some great dialogue from people that have done their homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4625.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one gentleman, he had the study from Europe that they don't allow this at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4629.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not even a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4632.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, the Board of Health was a member of that committee who voted no, that should speak volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4638.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore the city administrators that will be running this meeting, whatever department it is, whether it's Alicia Hunt, whether it's Tim McGivern, that they do not stop the process of our residents being able to speak, because this is their forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4659.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4661.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, if that does happen Thursday night, I will do everything in my power to make sure they are punished in every way possible through the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4672.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Councilor Marks, I will not try to delve into what you've already said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4679.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it was stated perfectly, and I appreciate you standing strong, and I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4686.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna sue our own entity here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4690.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not afraid to stand up and make sure that our citizens are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4693.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=582.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as a coach for 32 years at the high school level, you really try to find inspirations for kids to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=589.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You, sir, are a true inspiration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=591.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this city is proud of you, Mustang Country's proud of you, and I wanna congratulate you on a job well done, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=597.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=598.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2402.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2404.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be redundant, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2405.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank Council Marks for bringing up such an important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2409.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the emails and the phone calls I received, I think the frustration goes more in depth than just what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2418.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The whole lack of information, the fear that's still out there that hasn't been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2424.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward, I wonder if we can put an amendment that we can have the Acton City Solicitor to see if we can extend that period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2436.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the 20th is the date, I believe, so- Yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2441.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yesterday, so if there's a way that we can put a hold, if there's a way that the city can freeze that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2447.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's some issues that if you have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2450.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some of the members in the audience where other communities have put a stop to this, there's something to be gained by understanding that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2459.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having our city solicitor find any loophole that can stop this ASAP until we get the answers that Council Marks has brought up, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2470.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to make that into an amendment if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5576.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5702.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5706.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For those who might look at the census as just an irritant piece of mailing that almost every family gets, every household, and then disregarded and thrown away, I assure to spread the main<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5725.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: issues with the census is making sure that Medford gets as due when it comes to funding from the federal government for education, police, fire, and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5739.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that as the process is now getting underway,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5744.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we get an idea of what our plan for our city administration is to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5752.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighbor communities I'm seeing are starting a ground roots effort where if you see what the census is doing, they're now offering $28 an hour for workers knowing that it's important to get these issues and these numbers verified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5769.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as you can see, Medford is now a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5773.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: diverse community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5775.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with that diverse community comes people of questionable residency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5785.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the concerns we have are those numbers count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5791.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those numbers are very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5793.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've met and I've talked to different census bureau members that have talked to me about this being a federal law and how this cannot hold against anybody whether their documentation is updated or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5808.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's something that we need to make sure that our administration has a plan in place that will reach all of our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5817.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have an opportunity that it's being sent out in a variety of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5826.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The important thing that I'm finding out is that the census now, seldom are we gonna see paper versions of the census.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5834.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can now do it on the telephone, you can do it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5838.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many different ways to get this information that's so needed in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5843.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to know, I know that from what I've heard that Neil Osborne is going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5851.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: spearheading this, but I'd really like to know his plan and what we can do as a council to make sure that they're doing everything possible to get the word out and the comfort level to all the residents of this community that this information is vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5867.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure we get everything that's due to us and from the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5872.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for hearing me out, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=260.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=261.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see that Mr. Miller has all of their paperwork in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=266.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will move forward after maybe a brief, just a summarization from our petitioner and any questions from our Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=313.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=315.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you could just give us a brief overview, Mr. Martin, so we can, and we see all your paperwork is in order, but do you want to just give a little few sentences of what this is to explain to the rest of the council what we're doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=393.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great, so thank you, Mr. Martin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=397.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I've put in the American Legion post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=402.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate everything you've done for our country and all the members, and I see that you've done everything that's required through our licensing department, so I move forward for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=414.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=415.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1023.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, is this line, I'm not seeing if it's illuminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1272.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1273.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, my question was answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1275.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that being consistent with the other signs, I think I would agree with my fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1281.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1529.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1530.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1531.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my concern also falls with the number of signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1537.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To have one sign that says free vacuums, I think we can all see, we all know the location, we all see the vacuums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1544.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to have 13 signs, I'm just a little nervous of what would be added after that on those awnings, or what's hung on those awnings and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1555.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to hear what my fellow councilors have to say, but I just think this might be a little excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1564.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5967.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5968.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, just to reiterate, I think that for what the Historical Commission has in front of them, it's a daunting task when you look at our community and its historical values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5977.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we all, like Councilman Mark said, I think all of us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5982.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the situation that we were put in with this situation had a lot to do with maybe the COVID and the opportunity for both parties to meet in a mutual and respectful manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5996.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think both the commission and the homeowner were great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5999.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate the opportunity to walk through the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6003.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That piece was glaring, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6005.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's important to me is to sit in front of a home, not behind these chambers, but with the people involved, all in front of each other, face to face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6014.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was something as simple as Council Marks' experience by working on this council for many, many years to just bring up a topic that maybe both parties can speak on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6029.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we're seeing, we're seeing the best of the worst case scenario avoided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6035.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I applaud my colleagues and both the historical commission and the homeowner to reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6044.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we've seen our share of greeted developers in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6050.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this homeowner was very open and honest with us and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6059.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll work now with our commission to make sure that we are going to keep as much as the historical preservation that we can on that site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6071.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank my colleagues and I believe that's a good example of good government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6076.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6740.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7762.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7764.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Mock said, I too supported this in 2016, but I will tell you, I think that because the process does take the time that it will take, unfortunately, this isn't something that this council created or this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7781.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council delayed, I think I was one of the four councils voted for that in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7785.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think Councilor Knight brings up a very important point that we started our subcommittee meeting with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7791.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so much going on right now in our community that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7796.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus has to be on the bigger things in our community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7800.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that needs to be done down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7803.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that hopefully as you see things turn and people are back in this chamber and we get to move things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7810.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids are back in school and city business is done a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7815.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'll go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7817.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as of tonight, I think there are too many variables and too many issues that our city is dealing with right now to even spend a minute focused on charter review, considering that, like I said, it is a two to three year process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7830.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And right now, I think we need to focus on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7835.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: issues that are in front of us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7837.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, I thank both Councilor Marks and Councilor Knights viewpoints on both, but I will not be supporting this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7846.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8046.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there's areas to agree and disagree, but this is something we agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8051.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what we don't agree on is a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8054.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as one council who voted for this in the past, and knowing that it's something that needs to be done, like our zoning and many other things, historical issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8065.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this is important, but I think right now, I think there's so much that supersedes it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8070.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That if it is offered sometime in the next fiscal year, it'll be something that I will totally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8075.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support again, so I thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9558.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9859.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilman Marks bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9861.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, what people don't see behind the scenes is the work that Councilman Knight puts in when the camera's not on him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9869.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that all the questions we had during those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9875.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those meetings and before those meetings, it was always Councilor Knight that was the go-to guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9880.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that he put in the hours and effort to really make us shine finally and get this through and moving it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9891.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of good reasons why we need this, whether you believe in it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9897.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, we appreciate your work, Councilor Knight, and thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11379.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11381.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I appreciate Councilor Ike bringing this forward and this is a great initiative moving forward because I think Councilor Caraviello is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11389.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing that we've talked about and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11393.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in most other communities, if not all of the communities, they have, I know Councilor Marks has mentioned a thousand times, a clerk of works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11402.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That when there is any type of job, it's up to the city to make sure when that job is completed that there is someone there that signs off and then rechecks that in six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11414.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we're lacking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11415.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're lacking that layer of follow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11419.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11422.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11424.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as we look as we move forward, and the tight budget's going to be even tighter, but I don't know if there's an avenue that our DPW director or our engineer can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11442.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: look into and find that person that's going to follow through with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11448.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I know with the short staff that we have, these things fall through the cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11455.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think that as we move forward looking for an effective way of having a clerk of the works that's going to follow through with these is going to be most effective, I think, than anything here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11467.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12373.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12375.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12375.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for my fellow council members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12378.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to send congratulations over to Richie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12380.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, again, whenever there's a fundraiser and there's a young child going through some horrible issue and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12390.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's going to be a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12392.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Richie's always the first one to call and donate and be there for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12396.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's why he's been around for 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12400.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why he'll be around for the next 15 years, because he's always there when people need him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12411.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not speaking from experience, but the product's not bad either, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12417.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing it forward, and congratulations, Rich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12724.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12725.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I appreciate my fellow councilors bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12728.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that everybody said a lot of great things, and I'd like to just reiterate those statements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12735.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know it's sad, but you know when a family lays and leaves a legacy behind, and that's what Teresa's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12742.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12744.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way they raise their children and how they conduct themselves in here in our city of Medford and the legacy that they're passing on is so important to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12754.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank them for sharing their mother with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12764.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Maloney was one of the best and I think that we send our condolences and prayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12770.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15862.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15951.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16035.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16036.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We reviewed Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16039.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Payne's paperwork, everything seemed in order, and has everything that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16046.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if you could just give us a brief synopsis, and then hear from our council colleagues and vote this through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16092.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're just turning the permit over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16097.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To the same location, same business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16102.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16103.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16104.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16106.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16231.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=469.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3143.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3146.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I just wanted to reiterate my thanks to our team at LMH and thank them for always being on the other end of the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3155.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'd be remiss to say the backbone of communications, Sam Tarabelski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3162.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to see Sam back and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3168.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just reiterate, we have bumpy roads and to have the commitment of a partnership with Lawrence Memorial and Hallmark Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3179.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully as we move forward to bigger projects, especially in our backyard up in the heights in the future, that this partnership stays strong and moves forward in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3190.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you everyone for all your hard work and we still have some more to go, so I look forward to our future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3196.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3674.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4264.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could you just clarify that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4266.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought last time we talked, Mary Ann, you corrected me and said we were in the green, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5202.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5203.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mary, could you just reiterate, I know that I don't want people getting nervous if they read this the wrong way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5209.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that the way it's read, that if you talk to two students, one is positive, one is negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5216.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the case, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5227.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so there's only 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5234.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5239.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so one in two students aren't tested positive, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5241.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5243.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5243.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, thanks Marion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5363.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5364.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5366.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5367.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much, Marion, with all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5369.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you just, so where do we stand with youth sports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5374.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are youth sports participating now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5378.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they been approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5441.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So LaConte rink is open then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5445.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaConte rink is open?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5465.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one parent is allowed in the rink at a time with a child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5477.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, and it looks like the kindergarten are back in school with their teachers, so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5485.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5489.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so what I'm getting at, you're seeing a positive trend here moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5495.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that I asked the last subcommittee, I mean the committee, the whole meeting we had to give me some bullet points that I can present to you as a guideline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5505.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a great conversation, thanks to you, with President Asak from the Brockton City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5512.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they enlighten me on some great avenues to take to open up the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5518.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She also enlightened me that the good news is we can use our COVID funding to help fund the opening for open meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5529.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: like our city council meeting, so that was great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5532.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that I have a question later to our city solicitor to answer some of those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5537.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now with the numbers that are increasing, I think that there's some pretty good strategies that I'd like to share with you down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5546.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can help me out with some of those bullets that I could share back with you to open the council chambers to a safe limit and open it to those people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5558.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: want to come to our meetings in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5561.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my last question is, I think that, where do we stand right now with Halloween?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5567.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that's going around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5569.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the mayor and the department talked about, as Halloween's coming soon, what protocols we're going to be reaching for or what that's looking like right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5579.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something being talked about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6895.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6898.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mary Ann, I know that when we do our programs and we have the same situations where we bring in large crowds and so are you telling me that it's the custodian?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6909.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm assuming that anybody that comes into our buildings for contact tracing, we have a log for everybody that comes in through that entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6920.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have a name, a phone number, and an email address, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6924.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6924.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6925.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So do we have those logs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6940.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our custodians have those locks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6943.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who has them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6956.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That frightens me, because we do that with our Board of Health next door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6964.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know how private and shaky some of these organizations are, that they sort of protect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6972.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it amazing that we don't have, as they walk through the doors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6976.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a simple check-in where we have clean pens, and then we have pens that are put into a separate area to be disinfected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6985.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everybody comes in and signs that, and we hold on to that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6991.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if anything comes back from that church organization, that we know that we're contacting those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7000.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it hard to believe that we trust outside organizations that want to keep that position in our facilities for future programming, that we would allow them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7014.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope we consider that, because that's frightening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7021.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7028.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if Councilmax is done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7104.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7108.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7108.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7109.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, again, I don't, I hope you don't take this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7112.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not, I appreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7124.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't take this the wrong way, but it seems like there's a double standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7127.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We met the other day, and you were so adamantly against opening up these chambers because of the fear of overcrowding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7136.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, what you just said with these outside organizations, as passive as, as long as they keep six feet apart for 15 minutes, that's acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7147.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So-.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7207.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, maybe you are, but I'm just, as I'm moving forward, because I'm trying to put two pieces together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7212.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked me to put a plan in place to find a way to open these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7217.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm trying to figure out, because I asked help from our office, because I'm not in a public health background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7223.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I asked for just bullet points that can help me with that, and I hope you can maybe sometime during this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7228.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm trying to get at is just, if I present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7235.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the president, the rest of the council, a plan in place that has these new guidelines that this now new phase is brought in with what I can Google the partners that we have and that are using our facilities that got approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7251.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't mean to sound as trivial as it's going to sound, but if it's that easy, then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7261.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds that easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7263.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not being disrespectful in a way just to let other organizations in and then limit this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7288.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7297.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7300.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, but that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7308.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7309.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll get to that later on in the meeting today, but that's a great answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7312.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7314.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's great, that's a great answer because I think that that piece of the public health side to open this chamber, that's one of the two components we had a crossroads with last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7323.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for enlightening me, and like I said, I'll go forward with Councilor Scanlon with the open meetings issues and concerns that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7334.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7773.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12000.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ken, the petitioner again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12003.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying you have these emails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12006.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12007.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12008.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying you have these emails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12023.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12026.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have any other emails saying that you were on an agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12059.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if I can, to our commission, are you familiar with this email that he's talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12065.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because to me, this is a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12068.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12098.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so, and your idea that it was never construed that unless demolition is off the table, you're not welcome at a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12112.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I'd like to see that email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12114.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13258.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Council President, and thank you, Councilor Marks, for co-sponsoring this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13265.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think those residents do a great job with their curb appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13270.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do the best they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13272.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every time I drive by, they're out there with their push brooms, knocking all the debris away from their front doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13279.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're very patient, and we know that our DPWs try valiantly to try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13285.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep up with those potholes and they fill them on a, I think it's a weekly basis, but I think Councilor Mock said it perfectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13295.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just, it's too far gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13297.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a huge stretch, but it does affect those homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13301.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And truly in a negative way, especially with the way they live their lives, which is very orderly and very neat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13308.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope that we could find a remedy for them and get that completely done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13314.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, like I said, it's not a big area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13318.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something we could just move in and move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13319.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13901.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13902.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13904.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the chair, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13905.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is Max Caraviellole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14805.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14811.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14812.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, Sam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14812.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I have two of Councilor Marks' three amendments, but I'm trying to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14819.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second one I have is that there needs to be discussion of more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14919.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Real quick, I know I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14922.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we do something, especially before the first snow falls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14926.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Councilor Marksby, I think we all bring up good points and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14930.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could, it's ironic that my neighbor knocked on my door today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14935.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And something if we can add that we didn't realize until about seven months ago, the importance of our first responders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14942.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was frantic thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14944.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is the way of the world, she might be gone four days out of a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14950.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that happens during a snowstorm, she could be penalized for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14953.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as you go through the subcommittee, I know I'm not on it, but just point of discussion is really look at that as an option too, because I know it's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14964.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to distinguish what homeowners are first responders, but I think they'll be negatively impacted with this too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14970.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not to say we don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14972.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that other communities have great programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14974.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the community that I work for, they have four sidewalk trucks and they send those out, like Councilman Mark said, all throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14983.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they open up every main thoroughway and every park and every school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14990.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to have to put our money where our mouth is again, and give our DPW the tools to put this to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14998.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, it is the safety of our pedestrians that we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15003.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15017.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, just be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15018.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I trust my colleagues to make that a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15643.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15666.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paper 20585 and 28586, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15742.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: make a motion to combine, Mr. President, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15744.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, they're all the same owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15848.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15849.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Mr. Kapoor president today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15875.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I apologize for the delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15880.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or shall I believe, it seems like all of these petitions, everything seems in order and all the paperwork is complete, but just a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15893.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are all these hours of business just transferring over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15900.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the owner, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15901.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a change of ownership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15904.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so everything else stays the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15906.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the hours on Middlesex is 9 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15912.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 8 p.m., then we have Salem Street, 5 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15917.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11, and then the Felsway site is open 24 hours, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15930.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15934.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Middlesex, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15937.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a 24-0.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15939.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's the one that's 9-8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15944.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15945.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, I find everything in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15949.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15959.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before I go, I know what I forgot, I thought I had a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15963.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we normally, for new owners, we put just a review, especially for the 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15970.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Councilor Knight can help me, is it a 60 day review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15973.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 90- We usually do a 30 and a 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15975.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 30 and a 60 day review if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15978.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are the only restrictions, if we can, just to revisit as they're new owners to check their standing as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15985.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15987.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Should I apologize?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15988.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15993.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, on the Felsway site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16116.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I guess what I'm saying is- Just an information point to the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16134.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does the petitioner understand that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16231.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16231.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16232.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16294.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16296.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a clarification, it's Dr. Menon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16299.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one of the partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16300.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I might have made a typo there for the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16305.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I went back and I watched a few of the Board of Health meetings and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16314.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it interesting that we do have a consortium of physicians that work with our Board of Health Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16323.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it would be nice, just like I said, simple as it is, just to get some ideas of what the health professionals that are working with our Board of Health Director in the process as we move forward and putting together a criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16337.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that will help, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16339.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Health Director asked me to put together the plan, so as they move forward, I'd just like their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16345.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16426.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16430.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to reiterate this council's energy to reopen the council chambers for the residents that have reached out, not to eliminate Zoom, but just to add another avenue for those people that want to be heard and want an opportunity to come to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16456.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Talking to my sister colleague from Brockton, one of the things that they asked for with their city solicitor was, as we do here in the chambers, we have a limit of capacity through fire codes during our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16478.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we relate it to the COVID crisis and we have a set number and posted such, that would be, from what I've been told, might be the avenue that we need to reopen City Hall and making sure we're not violating any open meeting violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16497.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I ask this to be sent to the city solicitor to get her opinion and, again, to help me put together this protocol that the Board of Health Director has asked me to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16508.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16606.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this is something that at one point I reached out to fellow colleagues that put this on the agenda as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16616.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very troublesome and I don't want to wait until it's too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16621.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you, we had another pedestrian death as you saw, not in Medford, but in neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16629.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And before we get to this horrifying scene, I'm shocked that we haven't been there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16636.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I want to see is our, it's a very simple ask, is just put those raised crosswalks out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16643.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Slow traffic calming measures that we talked about months ago, and I'll revisit this next week as I ask for a committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16650.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did get some great news today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16654.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As great as it is, I don't trust the speed of this outcome, but I'd like to share with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16661.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know everybody got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16662.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16664.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a call today from Mike So-and-so at MassDOT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16668.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have identified the intersection of Main Street and South Street as a priority intersection that they would like to partner with us to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16676.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The initial design intersection improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16680.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They would hire a consultant to do this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16682.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in consultation with the city and would like to know if there are any consultants that have been working with us on this intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16690.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we have previously been told that we would have to pay this initial design phase, they are willing to fund this initial because it is on the top 200 dangerous intersections in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16703.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because of this nexus with the shared use path, in particular the south method connector,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16709.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would intersect Main Street right on the other side, Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16714.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Therefore, they see it as an important mass trails connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16718.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mayor, please let me know, blah, blah, blah, Alicia Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16721.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank Alicia for doing her due diligence to secure this effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16730.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's sad that the reasons why aren't safety, it looks like it's connection, but we're looking at a dangerous intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16739.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still want to move forward to ask our traffic department and our city administration to put the portable raised crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16748.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on those intersections to slow things down and give some information back to the dot as we proceed with this consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16757.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And great news, I know council marks last night spent the evening with the ever source team on the south street project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16766.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they approved speed bumps, I believe in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16772.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wish it was that easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16773.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish it was ever source to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16777.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make something happen that quickly, because this has been monumental to try to get anything done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16781.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A sign, paint, raise crosswalk, and I don't know what it has to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16787.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe, sadly enough, maybe it takes a death to make something happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16793.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is something that we talked with with the last administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16796.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something we talked with the mayor as she was partnered with us here as councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16800.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now as our leader in our community, I impressed on her to please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16805.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put these out there, make this happen now, because I would hate to see something happen between now and the end of this consultant's report and changing that intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16815.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's finally been identified as a top 200 dangerous intersection in the state of Massachusetts, but we've all known that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16822.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16824.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16825.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16826.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I still move forward to make sure that we can do that, and I open to my colleagues, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16830.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16974.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Put it as a resolution next week that we call for subcommittee on D O D O T for this exact one, this exact reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16986.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can set up a schedule and meet with them, bring them face to face with us and our state delegates and, um, and have that instead of, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17012.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I amend that we call for a subcommittee with DOT, our state delegates, our traffic department, and our traffic engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17024.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Alicia Hunts, I think she was on the forefront of this, to set up a timeline with the DOT to make sure this comes to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17036.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll try to do that as soon as we can with the Council of Presidents hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17040.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17042.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17389.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, if Council March, if you could add one more line to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17394.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the question I've had is what steps is the city doing for our employees that were violated and are having issues with their personal information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17410.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are they doing to support them, if that's okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17415.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2806.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second that motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2899.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President and thank you for the I appreciate council marks bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2904.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that We've talked to many residents who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2908.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: felt a little slighted Tim with the taking of those parking spaces and We can understand the biggest the biggest draw for myself as well as the bike lane is the intersection of Ruben Street and High Street and having an identified crosswalk and a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2927.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh an area now that people are going to have to stop the way they're going to reconfigure that area so i think that is a huge plus it's a it's a to me a huge safety issue we have right now um and and with council mox's uh<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2942.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: remarks with the with the with the turn I think it's very important and I too was I to talk to a few of the neighbors and the Request I appreciate how it's a mark soon as homework and getting chief Buckley to read to consider the parking overnight I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2959.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Again, it's all the Brooks parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2961.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We we heard you loud and clear It wasn't at any point that we thought that you know, we don't want to move forward with such you know an initiative, but we also have to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2973.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had to know that we got into this game really late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2978.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, once you've clarified the hundred residents that have been informed and have an end product with the taking of the land,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2990.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the continuation of the bike lane to make it a true bike lane where I too shared Council Mark's concerns with the dangerous situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3000.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then looking into that evening parking and the configuration of the high movement, I think it's a no-brainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3008.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I too will support this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3011.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I thank all the Brooks parents that originally started this years ago, because I don't know if any of the parents that originally started this project are even in, you know, their children still go to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3024.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I applaud those parents and moving forward with this initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3028.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7238.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with Councilor Marksley and Councilor Naidoo, but I remember, you know, Councilor Falco, I remember the tradition, it was the Friday of Father's Day weekend and then the vote of the school committee was that Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7252.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was that's what the deal was and we didn't like it then and as this as the we started the process as city councilors We didn't like the process either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7261.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I I will tell you the reason why I would like to see this information from our department heads Because this is what other communities are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7269.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've sat with my department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7271.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've gone through a five percent ten percent twenty percent reduction With a level funded budget from last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7277.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it prepares us so we all know we're all frightened of what's going to happen or what could happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7282.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at least we're prepared as a department that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7287.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am the assistant running that department and getting prepared to, as the time runs out and the state is dragging their feet and the federal government hoping for a buyout, I think we need the opportunity to see what's in front of us, to see what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7303.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think, you know, the fear is there anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7306.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand what Councilman Mark's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7307.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think it's our privy to come out and say, okay, look at the budget fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7312.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to have to cut 20 people, God forbid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7315.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7318.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understanding what we're going to see in front of us, not at the 12th hour like we have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7325.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, I don't blame this administration at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7329.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work they're doing, getting the auditor in front of us and talking to us and giving us forecasts, but I don't see what it will hurt to get this information in front of us right now from all our department heads so we can understand what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7343.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school department's doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7344.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They understand the situation they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7346.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're meeting with their department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7348.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're understanding this situation ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7350.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why wouldn't we, as a city, be prepared in the same situation for the same situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7355.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, I know of other communities that are doing a 1-12 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7360.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've already announced that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7362.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know communities doing a quarterly budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7364.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've already announced that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7366.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're seeing is at least they're getting minimal information, maximum information that they can receive, so they're prepared to move forward with their thought process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7376.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this isn't going to be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7378.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7379.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that if this stays status quo, this is going to be a difficult, difficult time for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7386.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And being nervous,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7389.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, as a municipal employee, I'm nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7393.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I look at our numbers, I'm nervous that I might be losing my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7397.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it comes with the territory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7399.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think as city councillors, getting that information in front of us is going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7404.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why, you know, I understand, I don't want to put the fear on anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7407.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, sometimes understanding something maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7414.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When your back's against the wall, this is when people push to our state delegates and reach out to the governor and reach out to the federal government, reach out so the president can hear us and say, listen, we need maybe not a trillion dollar bailout package, but maybe some kind of a package that we're focusing on our state and local<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7434.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: local governments to support us and what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7437.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So sitting back, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7439.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think that that, I think we need, I don't think we need to go after it and help and scare people and the sky is falling mentality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7448.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we need to be prepared as a council to see what shortfalls are coming with each department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7453.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important to what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7455.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I support that initiative, Mr. Councilman Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7459.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7746.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7746.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7747.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Bears' initiative to try and think outside the box, but I too, I think using an analogy my dad told me is, you know, to pay off your car, remortgage your home, to look at the possibility to pay a $20,000 car loan over 30 years that now it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7768.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: piles on top of what your bills are, just doesn't, I can't see that this concerning us today, leaving this to our next generation to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7782.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So believe me, I appreciate that maybe there's some other ways that we can think of creating revenue sources and bringing money in and trying to focus on being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7795.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know being creative and gutsy to go out and do it, but I think bonding our way out of that I just I I can't support that so I just want to make sure I made it public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=173.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=174.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=175.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks for bringing this forward, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=178.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President, this is, this is a family that again you have to celebrate because although they owned a successful business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=186.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were always one of the first businesses get back to the youth of the community so often you go in there, and you'd see a new plaque.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=195.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: express those representing and sponsoring another youth team or activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=199.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I've had the pleasure to know a lot of this Salvato family, and I know that they've done so much for our community, and I would support and second Councilor Knight's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=213.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=473.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=475.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward and we're seeing the uptick with numbers and what we're hearing is that the state isn't really going to look going backwards at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=487.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward and we look at the issues of opening school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=494.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: opening of the city council for meetings that be interesting to know if there is money that's still needed to the school system and what type of money they've used moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=505.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, and to see if there's, if there's need that we need to address as a council to move some initiatives forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=512.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I put that out as a resolution and hopefully my colleagues agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=587.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=589.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we get closer, we see the unbelievable completion of that beautiful building, our police station, and something we should be very proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=599.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, it poses a bigger issue once that building is open and the crosswalk where we've been talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=612.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: between south and main issues now with the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=617.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be interesting to see what type of plan we have in place, or is there any part of discussion about putting in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=623.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that what was discussed in the past were the rhino lights, the temporary crossing lights that could be installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=630.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if that's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=631.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it was mentioned, and I know that we did call for a meeting, hopefully, talking to Representative Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=638.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to get something for next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=641.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for next Tuesday at 530 just to discuss the top, one of the top 200 most dangerous intersections in the Commonwealth, Maine and South.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=652.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that we have some money coming from the state and the state DOT now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=658.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: agrees that this is one of the most dangerous intersections, and we need to move forward as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=664.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, with that conversation, to reiterate what I talked about last week, putting in the raised crosswalks as soon as possible to see how that can slow that traffic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=675.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping we get some answers, and we move forward in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=684.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=701.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The hope is that the discussion tonight with this resolution, with the traffic engineer being part of that meeting next week, that'll be something we could draw out all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=709.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to delay anything else as we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=712.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=713.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1197.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have the traffic engineer on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1956.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1957.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let me thank Councilman Knight for bringing up a very major point, a very important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1962.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what we're hearing from the state and what's being talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1969.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fiscal damage that we're going to see in a year is going to be pretty damaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1975.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that the request that he put forth a while ago that we do meet and really understand where we are, especially with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1986.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the free cash and where we stand with that, and where we stand with our taxes and our collections and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1995.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that we have an idea of where we are as we move forward, because let's not make this a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2002.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things are going to get really, really, really tough soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2005.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're going to have to make some hard decisions if we're not going to get the support that we need, both in the state and the federal side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2012.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2015.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2020.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at the raised crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2023.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great question, and it's something that was a great solution for the Central Ave location with Morrison-Parkes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2033.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because before that pilot program, it was just a speedway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2038.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it made a huge difference, being on the school committee back then, that that was one of the huge concern with the kids in the neighborhood, and the bus stops, and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2051.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a huge concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2054.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you see in neighbor communities, I know Todd might be familiar with it, I know that on Powder House Boulevard, there was an awful accident and a pedestrian death there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2064.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they did there is they didn't put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2067.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a raised sidewalk, but they put a raised roadway with arrows depicting the rise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2074.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really slows that traffic down in front of that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2078.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't see that being a major cost where it's actually, it was put into place very, very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2087.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were no decorative blocks, but there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2091.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a clear rise that slows down that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2096.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we can look into that, Todd, I'd love to get an idea if we can even possibly do that in some of the locations, including South Street, Main Street, as we're waiting for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2109.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: get through and see what they can do, but I'm just afraid we're going to get to a situation where there's going to be a death in one of these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2116.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're going to be telling each other, we told you so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2121.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2122.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if there's a way that we can look into that and look at some of this money because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2127.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need some clarity on what we're seeing around the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2131.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it might be like the 3,000, the 4,000, 5,000 hits with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2137.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you do it 15 times in the community, it's $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2145.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that looks temporary all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2148.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have light white paint around intersection streets with these white<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2159.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not cones, they're just sticks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2161.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within the first week that I saw them, especially in South Medford, they were knocked over immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2168.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you explain, is that temporary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2170.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that, how are we going to deal with that when it comes to, the question I had with the raised sidewalk at South and Main during the winter was, well, with plowing, we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2179.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, with all these sticks all over the place, how are we going to manage that area in that situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2233.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2339.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2340.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really think something like that, where that's more cost efficient, but more importantly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2349.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's long lasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2352.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're looking at something that's $10,000, putting in that what they've done on Grove Street and add that to what you can do at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2362.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at Central Ave, using that example, that would drastically slow down that dangerous roadway by putting those cheaper, more efficient hurdles to slow that traffic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2377.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, not looking at, because I'll tell you the truth, Todd, I appreciate everything you guys are doing, and I appreciate trying these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2383.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you're looking at putting in ten different areas with this temporary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2391.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $4,000 hits here and there, to me, I just think that it's not worth doing it right now until we're doing the full-time piece and using that money to something like the raised roadway in Central and other locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2410.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's my preference, but that's my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2414.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I look at equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2420.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been talking about Riverside Ave, Todd, for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2423.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see anything here with Riverside Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2426.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a major complex with two of the biggest schools in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2432.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's been some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2434.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had some issues there with both lack of cross lights, with traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2441.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And did we entertain anything on Riverside Ave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2536.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this- And I just want you to know, Todd, you came into a very difficult position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2544.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I'm not, this is just conversation that I've talked to constituents about, and just to share comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2550.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you're doing a great job, and we are seeing a drastic difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2554.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think people in our community see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2557.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've committed to traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2561.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And other than South and Main, I'm going to be honest with you, throughout the rest of the city, I think we've seen a huge support by your office in this community to say, let's try to find ways to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2573.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2575.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to, I'm not, if it sounds negative, I don't, I'm just looking at other avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2658.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=195.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh Chair, still in doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=196.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, is the legal representation, is Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=201.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Scanlon on or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=202.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Mulkey on tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=206.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because unfortunately I hate to hold our petition up again, but it is a valid question that we needed answered for tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=214.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we actually put in the resolution that it was date determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=220.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was, you know, we were pretty strict about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=223.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're under the assumption that would the chief of staff know any way to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=232.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: find a way to contact either the city solicitor or Mr. Mulkey to get on the call later on this evening so we don't have to do another night and just table this for later on in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=245.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=254.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=255.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm in total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=256.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a way to reach out to the city solicitor to see if they can answer that question or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=269.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll do that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=271.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate to waste the petitioners another week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=274.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that it's a question that's a legitimate question that we need before we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=284.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=287.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the table until we get communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=290.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you could just ask the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=299.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, just so the petitioner knows, we're just waiting for what we're asking for from the legal department to let us know that we're taking the proper course so that doesn't affect you moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=313.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're just waiting for someone if they can call us before the end of the meeting tonight, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=317.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=398.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=399.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I honestly, I thought that if he doesn't mind me adding my name to this resolution, I thought I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=404.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very close friends, graduated with the sun common.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=408.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and friends with his daughter, Fran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=411.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Palmisano was bigger than life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=413.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was that type of life of the party that worked for years for the Duck Tours and was a legend there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=421.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Always a person to make other people laugh and make other people feel comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=427.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another member of our community that had a battle of devastating illness and unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=437.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: passed on that with the major suffering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=445.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that, you know, you wish you could take away, but I know that he's not in pain anymore and he's in a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=452.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for his family, you know, Method residents who grew up and loved our community and, you know, raised by his wonderful parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=464.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their wonderful parents and Mr. Parmigiano was definitely the anchor of that family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=469.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So some of that will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=471.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I condolences to the Parmigiano family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=896.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=902.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=903.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=906.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'd like to thank, I know there's a group of residents that are actively taking a role in making sure that this is presented the right way so it's sent to the state in the most positive light moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=929.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was first elected, one of my first<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=934.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of my first initiatives was looking at the charter view and making sure that we could revisit something that we haven't seen in so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=940.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that had changed with me last time we voted, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=947.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reasons were very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=951.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was so simple that what was asked for was yes or no and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=958.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that as you talk about a commission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=962.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest things I think needs some debate is the understanding of ward and precinct representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=969.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that sounds so easy for everybody and there are definitely some pros in that aspect of making sure that each ward are represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=983.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: speaking for myself, working in a municipality in a community that has ward and precinct representation, I see a lot of negative affects of that situation where it becomes a special interest option, special interest groups around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1001.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I see is a lot of negativity in the sense that you have one community member and one part of the community holding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1011.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their colleagues hostage in for what they want their initiatives to move forward not what's greater for their community as a whole, but for their small piece of the community and you could, I saw negative effects, a few times that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1027.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It didn't, it didn't help the community, and, and that's because of that and you know some other options that when you know you get a phone call from someone from South Medford or get a phone call from someone from West Medford or someone from the Walton Glenwood area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1046.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I work just as hard as if it was someone in my own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1050.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it gives people the opportunities to call seven different Councilors to really push an initiative, or a concern that they're not following so I see the benefits there I know that there are benefits to go through with it to look at that but again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1067.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it was first presented as charter change or charter review, it was cut and dry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1073.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a great discussion with some members of the committee and talking about having a forum where we could discuss these options, where it's more of a thought process that it's discussed, it's understood, and maybe moving forward, it could be something that as you go forward with the initiative,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1095.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what you're looking for for charter review, at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1099.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: every piece is broken down and discussed and then thought upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1106.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but I do think these, as we move forward with this initiative, I think that I would support it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1116.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward, I think, but it's also a lot of questions that I think that we should really meet together with the administration and the committee members that are looking to form this commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1129.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um meet in the community the whole meeting and iron out any concerns and issues and then bring this forth with the with the solid base so we can move forward with the vote of seven zero to go to um the state house so we have no issues or concerns because i think that was the biggest thing as we move forward in the past it was unanimous<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1150.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support from a council to the State House saying we all support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1154.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, making sure that we have all of our questions answered and all of our I's dotted and T's crossed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1163.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think moving this to a committee of the whole in a relatively short period of time that we can get all the stakeholders in this room to discuss all the questions and then put this forth to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1176.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And later on they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1177.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: next meeting so we can find a way to move forward in a seven zero vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1182.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would, I would recommend that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1184.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's an emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2603.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, they're tied up with the family situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2607.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't wanna waste, I don't wanna have you sitting here wasting the rest of your evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2611.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can ask the clerk to have the answer reported back to the council and have someone from the city solicitor's office on the meeting for next week so we can get this taken care of and the answer that Councilor Knight can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2628.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can come forward if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2630.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2656.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, but it's a way that the permit process, the way it goes through, it has to be asked the proper way, and the way that it was asked leaves doubt, and not anything that you did, it was- I mean, I'm just an immigrant from Albania coming to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2669.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, I know, and we wanna-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2672.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't, we don't want...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2675.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're out of line right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2676.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're way out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2678.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's what you want, you're voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2679.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You won't win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2680.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll tell you what, you're out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2682.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to be kind to have you understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2684.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has nothing about you or race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2686.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For you to say that, you're out of line, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2693.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move to continue this until next meeting, have a representative from the law department to answer this question that has something simple to do with the process, has nothing to do with you or the permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2708.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has the process that leaves it in doubt, the way it was presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2712.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all it was, has nothing to do with the existing permit or anything moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2716.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To tell you the truth, I don't think anybody in this, including the question from the council who asked that we're not going to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2723.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've always supported our business owners, whether you were Italian or Irish or whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2729.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, there's a question that if we proceed with this, Mr. Abazi, and later we found out we made a mistake, that could affect your business and stop it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2739.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2740.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2741.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2751.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I completely understand, but like I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2777.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2779.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2783.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we're saying that, listen, when we put this out for you last week, we asked the administration to have that answer to us so we can just let you move forward today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2791.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we don't know where that where that dropped and we're going to as a council, we'll look into that because these are the issues we have, we've been fighting with this council to have legal representation at every single night for issues like this because this puts us in a bad way Mr. Bosley, and it's not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2806.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So and I apologize for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2809.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you I understand you want to work but I also don't want to approve something then come down the line that we have to then hold your permit and someone comes in from another department the city and say hey wait a second, you can't proceed, and then that affects your business in a way negative in a manner that will hurt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2825.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more than you think you're being hurt right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2827.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize if you think you're being singled out or attacked in any way, but this is just a policy procedure that we have to correct that someone made a mistake on, not you, not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2839.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's somebody that should have answered this question and you should have been gone an hour ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2844.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we're gonna we're gonna take care of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2846.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you, you don't need to be in next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2848.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2849.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2850.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to be in next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3403.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3409.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3414.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, I worked the storm in Somerville, and I think that I'm one of the first people people talk to when their cars are being towed and ticketed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3424.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as an administrator there, that's one of my duties while the administrators are on the road working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3431.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the signage you're talking about really is put in place after the storms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3436.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when they're going to remove the snow mounds up and down the street, the snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3442.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some of them luckily has the blinking lights at all the all the the storm alerts that are all the blinking lights, all the street lights that are blinking white light that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3453.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That calls for snow emergency for people to look at what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3457.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do a reverse 911.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3460.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do a, an email blast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3463.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the last thing they do before they get told is actually the police officers actually traverse the streets with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3470.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the tow trucks saying, please move your cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3473.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's under snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3474.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, but I think having the signs out there, if there's a way to keep it, I think that poses a couple of different concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3483.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One that we're going to have DPW workers that are going to possibly working, if it's a big storm like that, that are going to be possibly working 24 to 36 hours and having them go out hours early to put up signs or hours after to put up signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3496.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it really takes away from what we really need them to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3500.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, maybe working with the communications department to find a way to reach those citizens that reach out to you, that are not getting the notifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3516.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, you know, I think the signs might, I don't think they'll work in our community for that fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3523.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think we have the manpower to actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3528.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put those signs out and then if you're talking big snow, they're probably covered within an hour anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3535.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just think that there is a way that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3541.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: doing reverse 911 letting everybody know that there's a snow emergency, and what the policy is and which side to park on posting it on on public access television on the loop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3553.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, you know, sending out city wide emails that that people that aren't on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3560.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think a lot of people that don't get notifications, it's just because they haven't been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3565.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't been put on the list with communications and we've had thousands of people asked me, and all they really need to do is contact communications department and have their names and phone numbers added to that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3576.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that if there is a snow emergency, they'll get taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3581.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, one of the biggest things I have, being that I work in Somerville, I get the same notifications that residents get in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3588.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll get an email, I'll get a robo call, and I'll get a text message, you know, throughout the day before a snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3596.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once a snow emergency is gonna be declared, letting me know, and I live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3601.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't think this is a difficult ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3603.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that it should be, you know, maybe a little coordinated with the communications director moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3609.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, a little winded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3611.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3612.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing it forward, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3701.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but maybe looking at the portable digital sign posted in strategic areas that don't really get the information they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3709.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the sign itself, I just don't see that working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3715.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I agree with you, every which way we can to help to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=192.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=193.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Brennan, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=195.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do see your paperwork is all in order and it's acceptable in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=202.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=205.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The location being one, I know there's some confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=207.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says 177 College Ave, Mr. Brennan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=210.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that located inside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=213.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=223.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, and it obviously will be open for the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=228.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And not students that was a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=233.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are the what are the hours of operations you're planning on having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=254.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, and there's, I see everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=257.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest issues in that area is traffic and that has been approved with no hindrances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=263.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=267.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I open the floor to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=269.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=341.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=397.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=399.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=517.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1616.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1616.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, there were some concerns earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1620.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there are some limitations, we do have limitations of the information we can give about the person that has already been diagnosed and found to have the virus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1632.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it safe to say or could we say that it has nothing to do with the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1635.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that was one of the concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1636.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think the kids right now, they're feeling anxiety probably more than anybody right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1643.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just making sure if we could just say it has no one to do with the schools and we're safe from the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1673.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3421.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a suspension in communications from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3563.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3565.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3566.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you coming up, I know that it's a little nerve wracking when you're coming up to speak, but you did a great job in presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3574.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've had some of your student body here before, some of your friends, and they've brought up some great initiatives, and we're so excited that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3584.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: here again, and our goal is really to make Medford beautiful and share what we're truly about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3592.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the four categories you chose for Duggar Park, I think it's a great<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3600.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: way to spread that love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3602.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think you guys have done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3603.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a great initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3605.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my son John is also doing some great things with a great historian, Mr. Ken Krause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3614.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everything is nonstop and it's so exciting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3617.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I fully support this paper and move forward for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4008.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4009.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4011.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4013.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm requesting a table till next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4017.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Table till next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4018.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4511.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, through the chair, to Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4514.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In layman's terms, if people can understand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4517.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This resolution is really to have the voice of the people heard and not stifled, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4541.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in recent, as we can see, we had some discussions about open meeting laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4549.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I applaud my fellow Councilor to look at these concerns under transparency to make sure that the people are heard and we're giving them the proper forum where we're not stifled and they're not stifled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4565.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you with this resolution and I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4570.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5289.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I too applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5293.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as a municipal worker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5296.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who's someone who doesn't take sick days, people that are out there might question even with this intent, you know, that this is compromising city funding, but what they make sure they understand the way that it works is when people retire with the bank of sick days, they're then bought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5317.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you could look at, we're going through that right now where we have a custodian that is battling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5324.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: cancer, and he has a family of four, and he looks like, thank God, he's going to pull through, but without the sick bank process that we have in the community that I work in, that individual would have lost his home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5338.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are real issues, and this is what I think what Medford's all about, in helping your neighbor and your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5346.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm actually shocked that I didn't know that we didn't have it in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5351.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud Councilor Knight and I second the resolve, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6052.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I understand Councilor Marks' hesitation, but I think the meeting we just had in the subcommittee that outlined the limitations we have as a council now that limits our residents to come up and speak, I support this for the fact that being sponsored and having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6073.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an avenue to make sure that the constituent has a voice and is on the agenda as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6081.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I think this is going to be a huge culture change in understanding what we can talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6088.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as Councilman Mark said, I know that the biggest issue we had in subcommittees where in the past a resident would come up, have a concern, a serious concern, but we would support that by having a dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6104.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by the rule now, that violating the open meeting law, that limits that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6112.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It eliminates that completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6114.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't talk about it, so Mrs. Jones comes up and talks about some serious issue that we need the police involved in, something that I believe was emergency or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6126.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: natural disaster that we can speak on at the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6129.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it limits different speaking points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6132.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with this, I support it for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6136.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there's an issue, we have a constituent that has a problem, we assign the number to it, we sponsor it as a council, and make sure that that issue is presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6145.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I feel that it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6148.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's all in the same breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6149.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're all looking at making sure that our constituents are heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6155.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And understand again that this is going to be a big change for what we're used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6161.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when doing business, when people come to that podium, because what we were told by ruling of the attorney general is that we can't talk to you as a council in fear of violating the open meeting law on concerns and issues that are brought to that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6178.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whether we like it or not, this is the reason why I support Councilor Knight's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6184.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7992.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, being close friends with both, um, the Morse brothers and understanding that, uh, what Mr. and Mrs. Morse have done left, uh, with, uh, teaching their children, uh, that community is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8008.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to lose her was a great loss to Dennis and Hank, but I know that we wish them well and share our support with their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8020.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8925.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I can understand Councilor Knight's presentation, the understanding that we've had some recent, uh, recent concerns, but I, I too, with Council Marks, I know that the Felsway has turned into, um, you know, front yard, um, parking areas and it does take away the appearance of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8948.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, um, although in good intention, I don't think I can support this either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8953.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9043.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9045.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The motion to suspend the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9058.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9059.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9062.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've had a petitioner here waiting patiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9064.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 20-100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9065.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9066.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9120.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and forgive us for...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9125.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having you sit so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9126.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that all the paperwork is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9130.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9131.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this is a Lambert Street location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9136.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you worked in the field before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9138.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you been in the business before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9139.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9140.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9141.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9142.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what type of food do you bring to this location?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9148.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it just pizza or is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9153.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9154.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9155.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many people will be working for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9159.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9160.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hours of operation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9166.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9167.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that falls on the premise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9168.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I have no other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9169.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9363.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9365.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just public for the viewing public, I know that I've received some emails from constituents that are totally against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9372.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, to their understandings that this is something that was voted on in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9378.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we are required as a city council and a city to provide, I believe, at least three licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9388.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you're for it or against it, I just wanted to reiterate that this is a mandate after the vote that was taken and moving forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9399.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that Councilor Knight has already contacted us to move forward quickly and get a resolve and move this petition forward, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1188.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1190.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1191.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is such a welcoming addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1196.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that especially when you hear some of the bantering of the negativity of the pop-up park and the parking lot where there's no shade, there's nothing that really attracts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1208.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: families to that area in the concept that we're seeing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1212.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this really fills a gap in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1216.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something I'll support 1,000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1220.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question I had is I know that we've had residents that made that the chess hub of the world, it seemed, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1228.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know one resident worked very hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1233.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the tables there, the chest tables and those coverings going to be able to shade those areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1265.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, if you can, just if you can reach out to the resident, I'll share his information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1269.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1270.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1270.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you can just, you know, even maybe get him involved in saying, okay, as you kind of built this area and really made it when people didn't know what it was going to be used for, he kind of made it a home for families and kids that really needed an area to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1287.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it was, it was a great vision and great opportunity for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1291.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate all your hard work and I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1293.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1294.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2478.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know, you know, this is such a great gesture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2481.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's exactly your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2482.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we appreciate that because you know what it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2486.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we'll ever forget Larry, but just a little symbol to keep Larry's light alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2492.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a great fitting tribute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2493.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2495.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that if there is something that if we need to make sure that happens and look for some other alternative funding, I think that we as a council should try to find some other avenues to make sure that that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2507.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that'd be a great gesture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1588.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1673.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1674.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I appreciate all the hard work everybody's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1678.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this has been a long time coming, and there's just a couple of concerns that residents have reached out to me about that couldn't make it to this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1685.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that Commissioner McGiven helped with a lot of those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1691.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as honorable and as lucky as we are to have a committee of dedicated members of our community, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1703.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really that there is some fear that having a community group making decisions that affect homeowners left some questions with our residents, but I appreciate the clear questions and definitions from Commissioner McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1721.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2387.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilors, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2388.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And please forgive me, I was hoping, I know that we might, I guess we had a glitch early in the meeting, so I have to pop out again in a few minutes to shut down a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2401.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to, if I can jump in a little bit early, just to give some comments, if that's okay, President Bez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2406.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2409.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Commissioner McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2411.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's kind of the questions that I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2414.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Also with former Commissioner Forte, we really had some in-depth conversation with him and his vision with what he saw as the enforcement piece as we moved, especially to the private protection piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2430.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that in my situation, I do think that this is a lot of work and there's a lot of work that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2438.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were so many changes that I hope that we do move on to another meeting with our city department heads because I think it's important that we do do a cost analysis and especially moving into the next budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2451.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with all the new money we have looking into bringing qualified professionals into departments that can handle such a task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2461.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what I'm hearing is, and I won't speak for Commissioner McGiven, but it sounds like this will really overwhelm our existing team in comparison to what they're already doing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2475.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2477.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I had a brief discussion with the building commission today was great and he's ready to do everything and anything possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2484.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as you look at the private tree protection, I think 1 of the biggest concerns that we had starting a few years ago is really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2494.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um, having government come in and tell residents what they can do on their own property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2500.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, and this isn't this, this doesn't affect thousands of trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2504.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this affects many trees, but I think it does affect the quality of life and the expectations of homeowners that might want to, um, you know, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2516.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have some I have to be very careful with my ethics when we talk about solar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2521.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to leave that to the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2523.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's some questions the other residents had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2526.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I think Attorney Stein did put in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2531.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, some legal pieces when it came into the opinion of subject of challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2536.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, if we wrote in an ordinance and making some of these changes to the private, uh, tree protection plan, I think that, uh, that that might be again, that's something we talked about in the past and many, many meetings about being a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2550.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the former commissioner, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2555.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, uh, Forte really had a plan in place that he was willing to share with us that is used in neighboring communities that really didn't affect most members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2565.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I fully support when we talk about new development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2569.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, I fully support when we have people coming in and flipping houses and taking down trees to, to, uh, find a way to mitigate that with the tree fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2579.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a superb idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2580.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's something that will really benefit moving forward with, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2585.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: taking care of our tree canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2586.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2587.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, um, again, I think there are still so many questions when it comes to the price, especially the private piece and the implementation pieces with either the DPW and their tree service team and, um, the building commissioner and his team when it comes to, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2608.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: moving forward with any of these added duties with the tree process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2614.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I apologize for leaving early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2619.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you allowing me, Council President, to share the concerns that was offered to me from some residents and historically what we've been talking about for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2630.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do wanna see this move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2633.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, in any way, try to hold this back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2635.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have so many great ideas, and I think that, uh, our volunteers did a great job to help design and and craft an ordinance that really has some meat on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2649.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think with a lot of these red line changes, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2653.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of people were confused as well in what was happening and we're a little nervous about there'll be a vote tonight, but I do think this is a good piece to, you know, my recommendation, move this to another meeting and bring all the city staff with some, after they've revisited all of these changes and put together a plan on how we could really make this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2674.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank everybody and I apologize for my dismissal, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2717.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I thank you and I now leave the meeting so you can speed up your half and not waiting on roll calls, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2724.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1743.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Ted, for you and your team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1746.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you guys have been super busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1749.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that questions people ask, usually this is later in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1753.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would assume that this is tied into what's gonna happen in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1758.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is the increase of the override to people's taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1762.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the phone calls I received, should we come to these meetings, can we stop it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1767.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tried to explain to residents that, you know, so they can understand in layman terms that this is a tax rate that we are not going to put forth and whatever this council decides, plus what the override is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1783.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So someone that's a million dollar home, you'll see, you know, that 7,800, 7,500 a year tax now then increased another, I know one resident<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1794.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was quoted about $800 for their home for an addition on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1799.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is why people are asking, why are we doing this meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1803.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's, you know, I want to make sure it's clear that we're doing this so we can, that we give your team enough time to set this rate, then we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1812.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in January, everything will be in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1814.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just to let everybody know, it is happening in January that the override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1820.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: increase will be added in top of this, which the rates were, the new assessment, like was said, was assessed from the 2023 sales home sales, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1832.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1833.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one thing I wanted to make sure that everybody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1838.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that, again, to be clear, this is year after year that the override tax doesn't disappear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1845.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This just increases plus two and a half percent, if that so be it, every year to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1850.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what the questions were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1855.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other thing that's confusing people when you talk about new growth, when you hear new growth in communities that have a booming commercial base or you're seeing a new tax revenue coming from new development,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1872.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the new growth we haven't seen much in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1875.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want people to understand the new growth that we've been talking about during the override, it's new growth coming from increasing taxes that we see as the levy increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1888.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want people to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1889.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1892.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a question that's been brought up saying that, oh no, they've heard from some councils that said that Medford was number one in Massachusetts in new growth, which isn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1902.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure that those points were just brought up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1909.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a different new growth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1911.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we talk about new growth and development is very different than what you talked about tonight, and new growth and tax assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1918.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So am I correct with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1919.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to speak for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1946.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1947.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I think that the last piece is what everybody's asking for now is what Mr. Castagnetti has been saying for years is the owner occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1956.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's a slippery slope because it sounds so easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1958.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my neighbor who's 86 years old said, George, if this, if you vote in the tax exemption, I'm living a single family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1966.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I'm if the exemption goes through for homeowners and I get my taxes would be lower than what they were in the previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1974.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said that's true, but when you look at the way we look at the big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1979.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1981.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: majority of our residents in a negative way, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1984.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their tax will increase even higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2019.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the word is out that Somerville does it, Cambridge does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2022.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why is it beneficial for their communities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2023.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do they have that we don't that allows them to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2040.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So typically, communities like that will adopt it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2043.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2044.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2045.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: appreciate all the hard work you guys, your team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2048.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been, uh, I know it's been trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2050.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you were on the hot seat a month ago and I apologize for any, any, um, you know, um, uncomfortable questions that were asked, but I know it was, you stood there and did a wonderful job and, and, uh, we, you know, appreciate getting that out the Friday, the week before, so people can get a better understanding of what it looked like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2069.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2070.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why we had such a close vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2073.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was very close because of that fact that people started realizing the true numbers and the effects that we're gonna have on the homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2079.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2081.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3909.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing things that, unfortunately, your department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3914.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been tasked to do things way too late, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3919.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm glad to see my fellow colleagues are now realizing after they supported the override that how the vulnerable community is really gonna hurt now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3929.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3930.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something that I welcome the conversation starting earlier now to look at that homeowner exemption because of that demographic that I was screaming about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3944.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that bought their homes for $50,000, but now they're worth a million, and they're being priced out with additional override taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3952.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to hear that we're at least understanding it now, and that there's pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3959.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's going to be something that we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3961.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you'll be here in June to do that with us, but we really need to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3966.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3968.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have to be alarmed, as some residents have said when we talked about this issue, is that the burden falls on who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3975.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It falls on the homeowners that have rental properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3980.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are the ones that are going to pick up the burden if the exemption comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3984.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fear now is the talk that was started last year was rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3990.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this is something that this community should really pay close attention to because there's a machine that's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4000.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there's a system in place and people have to see what's happening with our council in the direction they've been moving to, whether it was, you know, transfer tax, whether it's fees for a registry, whether it's an override, whether it's a homeowner exemption now and looking at rent control possibly in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4020.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot that this city is gonna be moving to if people don't realize and get more involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4028.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This administration, like my colleague said has done a, at least from what I gather, she was saying she was saying that they've done a terrible job, really preparing this community, and what avenues we can take to give us the best choices possible, both in a, a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4047.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a speedy override discussion without the input and without the proper timing during the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4056.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now here we go with the assessment and the levy that we have to look at, look at homeowner exemption as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4065.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate what my colleagues have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4069.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that we can't do anything today, but it's something that we, I think, have to look at early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4078.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: earlier in the season now, when we get to the budget season to make sure we have enough money in the overlay to make sure that if we have that 49.9% of homeowners that apply for the exemption, that we can cover that cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4091.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4574.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4687.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=414.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=415.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for my fellow colleagues to add me to this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=419.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it speaks volumes for me as a school team member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=423.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was part of that group that was first initiated with the thought of, hey, there's a program that we really want to start here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=432.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=434.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we didn't have a slip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=436.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have any docks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=438.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have a boathouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=439.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=441.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were borrowing skulls from different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=444.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different colleges and they were donating them to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=447.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really started so and you know, it's just a fad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=451.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I what you realize is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=455.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: committed young people really drove this when we first started it to where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=460.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's so amazing that we have state champions in front of us right now with committed coaches and kids looking to go to the next level, colleges, universities, and participate in crew at that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=474.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's just amazing feet and see where we've gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=476.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know what, I'll say it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=477.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a bunch of parents that I work in recreation and one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=481.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the most attractive pieces of our puzzle in Somerville is our boathouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=490.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we can do, we have summer programs using rowing crew and the different avenues of community that crew really brings to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=501.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it publicly, I would love to see the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=507.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: use our CPA money to look down the line to building us a true boathouse over at home else stadium I think that, to me, would be full circle and look at something that you know we have an avenue, we have a funding mechanism in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=521.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now all we need is a reason for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=524.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you've given us this reason tenfold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=526.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to congratulate all of you coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=529.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Mr. Maloney was in the forefront years ago when people told him that this wasn't going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=534.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe if maybe some people remember, when we first started, they put a couple of rowing machines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=542.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in what's now the boys locker basketball locker room in the gym.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=546.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it still there do you guys still use that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=549.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was like that's all we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=550.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had four, and people were just taking turns, jumping in so we've gone a long way so I commend all of you for pushing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=559.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's amazing when you listen to other people from different communities, when they talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=565.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What Medford crew is doing at the regard is and what they're doing at different events, and how you're seeing sportsmanship and and pride in community and this is what it's all about, you know, in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=577.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Traditionally, it was what hockey, football, baseball, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=581.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're seeing lifetime sports where you're seeing people using crew to go to the next level in academia, and then taking that to the next level and really promoting something that's really healthy and positive in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=596.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know I'm winded, but I just wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=599.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had the vision when this came forth of when this started, when I was on the school committee and seeing where it is today, just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=608.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like so much pride with all the medals on our athletes and coaches standing there stoically and I appreciate all this hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=616.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=816.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Cullohan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1349.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1350.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It truly was the victory, the first time greater Boston League champion since the early 90s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1358.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First time announced tonight, first time we've had a greater Boston League MVP and Justin Marino.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1365.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So many kids now coach Curley and his coaching staff ascending off to play at the next level that you have, and you're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1374.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a group of kids that without football wouldn't have an opportunity to get to the next level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1378.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1381.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I really want to stress is how impressed I am with the football program for what they do for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1389.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you see the wins and Thanksgiving, that's great, touchdowns, and everybody's happy about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1394.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I find more amazing is what they did the week before when they went to the shelter and they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1402.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They prepared a couple of the, what am I thinking, Zach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1411.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The food, it wasn't the meals, they were doing the different community centers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1420.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so they really, the pantry, excuse me, thank you for helping me with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1424.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But they were setting up the food pantries and helping with stock and share and present that to the community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1433.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You'll see them this winter, delivering, shoveling seniors out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1440.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you're seeing right now is a true champion in the sense that, forget about the wins and losses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1447.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach for 32 years, you seldom remember those truly what they're going to remember is what they did as a team and as a family as being part of a community and really giving back to the community so I congratulate coach curly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1463.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris Murphy, who's the President of the Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1467.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: football program and what they do for our community and give them back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1471.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would love to invite them to our next meeting, if we can, Mr. President, to them and our next guests and the band and really celebrate what they've done, both on the field and off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1483.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's equally important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1484.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1830.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll share, I'll share, I'll share with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2161.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had some phone calls after and I think that the biggest concern was the private process of tree removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2170.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Residents were really concerned with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2172.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their freedoms and what they have control on their properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2175.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that at the time KP law did say that that could be viewed as taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2181.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that that's something that will be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2184.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that as people ask me, this is the process, it's gonna be vetted through the process and we'll get a clearer understanding as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2192.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2443.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2445.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see, is Mr. Silva here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2447.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2448.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2449.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2451.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe this is just a carry over from the previous owner who his family had owned it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2461.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Calais family owned the donut shop for many, many years, a fixture in the Mefford community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2470.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm so happy that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2473.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Silva stepped up and kept this location alive because it is something that I remember when I was a kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2485.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After church, dad would go over to Demet's and pick up the healthy donuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2492.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They weren't the bad ones at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2495.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2499.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looks like everything, Mr. President, is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2503.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think the only questions we have is, you know, the number of employees, the hours are staying the same, and that would be it on my end, but I don't see anything that would prohibit us to move this forward after my colleagues share any thoughts, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2596.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we just, honestly, if we have any other questions, this is a pretty straightforward petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2603.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2604.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2606.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Mr. Silva can add anything, maybe reach out to the clerk for a next meeting, but I don't want to hold this up any longer if it's something that's just technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2635.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2636.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seems like just a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2679.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Should ask for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2795.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question to the attorney while we have the hours of operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2800.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you continue those with us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2810.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2810.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that sometimes when they go outside that I just would like to remind the petitioner that if it's later that that had to go through the process as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2820.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. President, I see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2824.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm excited that we don't have an empty storefront and we see a responsible owner coming in and taking over and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2834.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2838.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2839.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My colleagues have any comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2277.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2281.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2285.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that presentation was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2287.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm going to be the person that people call because they're nervous about what they hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2293.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's good is that we're having meetings so we can express the rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2304.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2306.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being permitted, we're going to look at zoning for 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2310.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to see that's not going to happen on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2314.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate all your hard work with that and making sure that that message is out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2319.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we talk to residents from that corridor, the biggest concern they have, not just the people on the main drag, but on the budding streets, is making sure that we have parking, making sure that they're seeing different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2335.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different processes that are happening that are taking parking away from a business district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2341.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one of the things there, you know, the business owners that I've talked to this weekend, they were really concerned about that because they're all small businesses and it's very important that, although we can hope that it's just gonna be a walkable transit, public transit corridor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2360.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the truth of the matter is that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2363.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having an open mind when we look at what the total community looks for, I appreciate my colleagues doing a better job, I think, and getting the word out, but I will share with you that there is still the need to put that comprehensive plan that we asked for in the RFP to go into the Salem Street neighborhood and have those neighbors that can't come here or join us on Zoom<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2386.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that want to really get involved and understand what happens in that quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2391.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that you're seeing this, you're seeing fractions of the community right now where neighborhoods are rallying and creating neighborhood groups and getting attorneys and fighting zoning everywhere because the truth of the matter is there isn't enough, there is enough information that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2413.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to say that there are people getting it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2416.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there are a lot of people that aren't getting information on what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2419.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, I try to do my best and I'll share this information for the people that have reached out to me and said, George, we're concerned 12 stories on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2428.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, this is easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2429.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no such thing as 12 stories on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2432.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but you know, it's nice to see that looking at pieces like the MBTA area where maybe redeveloping that area where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2444.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it made Salem Street look like such an eyesore as a, you know, gateway to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2450.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that that's when you see successful zoning changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2454.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see neighbor communities really using the gateway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2457.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the communities is really enhancing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2459.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we have some limitations for businesses that are there, but I'm glad to see that we're looking at, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2471.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being responsible to our neighbors and our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2474.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm excited to see a change on Salem Street where we have mixed-use areas and we're seeing more storefronts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2482.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing more families walking that corridor and looking at, you know, having little pockets of, you know, sitting areas with fountains and, you know, but I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2493.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that we've seen it, and we know all the hard work that we put forward with this, is that really getting the true message out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2500.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's all I'm saying, because I'm saying that, you know, in other situations that we're seeing in the community, where there is concerns that they're going to an extreme, you're seeing some pretty extreme things happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2512.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is so good and so new that I think we really have to find other avenues to reach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2520.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more of our residents in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2523.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever we have to do, I know that, you know, I know Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2526.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt you've explained and it's tough that other communities have big, big departments and we have a small department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2532.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2533.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why when we talked with the last council, we really stressed the fact that no matter what it took in the mayor's office for the city to put that into the RFP where our zoning partners can come in and bring teams in just like neighboring communities have done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2548.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, as we're moving forward, I love the clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2552.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see it, but I think that there are a lot of people that don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2556.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest concern right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2559.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's great if everybody rallies around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2561.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It makes everything a lot smoother, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2565.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your work, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1605.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, uh, uh, gentlemen chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1608.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate first your assistance and these endeavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1612.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh, to be clear, I think that not to confuse everybody, but this is, this is what the conjunction with the, um, the charter committee that's been working so hard throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1623.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, I know that I had a question with, uh, just a text that the message text message saying, is this different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1629.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, it's, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1631.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all conjunction, so this is a big team effort and making sure that we're putting the best product out and making sure that we have the best information moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1640.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we send this off to the state house that we're all in 1 breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1644.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I just wanted to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1647.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and then, uh, if I can having the gentleman at the podium this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1653.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Frank Wright, one of the most well-respected city auditors that I've ever worked with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1658.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really appreciate his presence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1660.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then Frank, if you need a job, Method's looking for a city solicitor and we could do anything you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1667.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2599.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3191.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3193.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all the hard work and a lot of the questions that I really have is really based on just the information that I'm getting from residents and there are some that are very easy for me to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3208.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh explained to to eliminate some fear and and and and rumors that were going around and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3216.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was wondering if if our friends from Ennis can just have you ever been given a request because a resident asked and I said I I would reach out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3225.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh for for city councilors and for uh people that have been educated when it talks about zoning and it's it's easy to follow but have have you ever been requested from a community that you've worked with to try to maybe simplify some of these definitions and maybe a bullet point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3246.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: type of report where where this meeting when they we talk about parking and understanding the offsets when it you know the biggest fear i'm here i give you a good example is the situation that we're dealing with and with tufts university and a 10-story building and how it affects residential homes and it's it's it's clearly defined in this process when we see the the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3275.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the changes that we're looking at and how the residential area, we won't see those types of drastic changes where some residents are fearful for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3292.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have you ever been requested, and this would be my request, that after a report is given like we've put together tonight, very thorough, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3303.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to without embarrassing or disrespecting anyone, have you ever been asked to put together a bullet point that really simplifies what was discussed today so just the average person can read and understand the basic points that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3321.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have gone through because I, I think this is where it's overwhelming and this is where people I know council beers and council vice president and our director have put together an extensive plan to make sure that we're reaching our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3336.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've been standing on my soapbox and really saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3340.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, bringing our meetings to the neighborhoods where people can ask these simplified questions, because I think a lot of people that have reached out to me are a little intimidated by the language and this format, which I believe we can all agree to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3354.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, if there's any way that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3358.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some sort of a format that can be simplified so people can understand what the major changes are and what the processes are, I think would be super helpful if you can help with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3371.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3414.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the diagrams have been super helpful that because that's one thing that is really simplified that I hate to say it, but to show people pictures with what the changes will be made it very simple to explain to some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3429.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate that council vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3606.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>
