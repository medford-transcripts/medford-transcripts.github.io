    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1037.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1039.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1352.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1358.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1359.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1373.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1374.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the 200 feet that we were told that Winthrop street will now have sidewalk throughout the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1381.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's national grid is going to take care of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1383.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a national grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1384.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was ever source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1386.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was already set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1387.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1389.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll be, that'll be part of next week's meeting too, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1392.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can see this part of the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1394.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was in the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1395.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1396.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1396.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1397.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1400.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1580.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, for one, I know that this council has worked very hard with making sure that our, uh, our natural grid never source and other utilities do what they need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1592.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1594.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will be the first time I'll see that, that announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1596.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is something that we'll, we'll get on as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1600.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming out tonight and, uh, and sharing your opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1604.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1606.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we have a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1608.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have any other, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1609.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1610.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How's it going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1927.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1929.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think this is, we just had a Committee of the Whole meeting with the project being done with Eversource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1936.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things we talked about is, as we move forward with that before we approve it, is having more of community input and making sure we have community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1944.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this disheartening that this has happened again to this neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1948.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I know that you have champions behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1951.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to make sure that we can do what we can right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1954.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, Mr. Vice president, if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2149.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2149.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the motion, Vice President Mast, that we amend the paper that be forwarded, the mitigation, the Traffic Plan, and the Clerk of the Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2163.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighbor communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2164.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the four pieces I believe that we need to send to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2169.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2171.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2171.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So second, uh, Councilor Knight, all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2176.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2177.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2359.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2361.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember the resolution is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2363.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Consumers appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2365.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to, on the motion, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo that this go to subcommittee on economics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2373.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Business and economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2374.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Business and economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2376.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2379.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2451.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2452.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe at the end of the meeting, Mr. Cassin, if you could give us the name of that company that we can actually, not publicly, but ask the weights and measures director, Mr. Champoli, to look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2463.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what his job is, to make sure those ones<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2473.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Leave a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2505.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They also do the oil trucks and all our cabs too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2508.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2510.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On that, on that motion seconded by council dollar Russo to, uh, move this paper to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2517.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On economic development, all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2519.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2520.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2521.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2522.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can go to unfinished business, uh, 17-571, um, to dispose of its common vehicular license, City Bazaar, 466 Main Street, City Council since July 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2538.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's been tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2539.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, they're not coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2541.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have the motion to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2546.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2608.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took them from Councilor Moxley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2610.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Records were stolen by Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2612.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were tabled records of meeting October 17th were passed to Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2617.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mungo Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2618.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2619.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Records of the meeting, October 31st, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2621.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll pass to vice president marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2628.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2629.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the motion table, those records all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2632.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Opposed guys have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=618.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=619.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Billy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=620.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=622.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, Councilor Moxwell, reiterating what, I don't want to be redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=628.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You brought up the same points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=630.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that in today's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=637.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Studies have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=641.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=649.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're limiting them from using public transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=652.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I second the resolve from Council Marks and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=658.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can, and if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=685.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: information back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=692.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=696.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=701.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to put a picnic bench out there, it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=708.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, uh, what goes on in that area and a negative note when, um, when there is, when they, when they are waiting in between buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=722.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I second the resolve from, uh, council marks and, um, amended, uh, well, to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=736.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an answer back within two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1394.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1396.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Pelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1397.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1398.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, my colleague, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1400.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that months and months and months ago when we first were presented, I was one of the councils that voted against it because of the lack of information that went out to our constituencies, to our community, and with the opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1418.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in discussions with neighbors, where neighbors that have been very conscious about purchasing their own energy and they're valid in understanding what the situation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1432.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I did my homework in visiting a few communities, one of the biggest pluses were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1440.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The plan that was put in place once it was passed by each community, and the plan that notified our residents about the value of this process and the option of opting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1455.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So one other thing that I want to point out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1458.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: question that came about was who would fund the notifications, all of the work that needed to be done to let all of our residents know about the opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1469.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with our last meeting and having the director from Melrose who came in and spoke so well on this issue, we answered a lot of questions that were brought to my attention that people had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1483.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: asked me about and how would we find out who would pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1487.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it all comes under the company that would be awarded this project if and when it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1498.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my biggest concern wasn't the community aggregation plan because I think it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1508.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1513.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: constituent can use in bringing their electricity bill down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1517.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, not dramatically, but it does help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1520.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, the biggest piece was getting the notification out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1526.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic now in making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1533.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When that plan is released to the public, it's going to be very thorough and with as much information and time needed for our residents to opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1546.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, one of the issues we often hear is a lack of notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1551.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, with this plan, it falls back on the company that's awarded this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1558.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that in turn goes back out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1563.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this up, and I second her motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2789.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we tabled it because they didn't they couldn't complete all the questions we had and they didn't get to to explain their whole Communication plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2802.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a and then we're completing it next week So is there a way that we can get?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2809.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe the city engineer can give us some information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4531.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Pelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4532.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4533.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to be redundant, but I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4537.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the issues of having that master plan, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4544.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we wouldn't be true to this position if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4549.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: weren't looking at the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4551.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, as one person put it, to hold this valuable historic piece hostage, in a sense, would be frightening to me if we would lose it over the winter because we didn't fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4568.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we weren't part of those discussions years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4572.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the plan that was put in place, and with the CPA that's now in front of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4579.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we talked about last week, using the Brooks Estates as a viable revenue source, I think it's something that, as someone that worked very hard on the recreation piece over the past few years, and talking to our friends from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4600.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Brooks states and looking into different avenues that we can capture funding, I think it's a positive move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4607.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the thought of possibly losing the Carriage House to me is unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4612.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So one thing we did preach over the last few years is our support to our historical sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4621.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to, in my eyes, I feel that this Carriage House is one of the granddaddies of them all, so I'm going to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4630.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=824.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=826.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, George Scott Pele.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=829.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 27 Butler Street, Matthew, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=831.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, what I'm hearing on what we've seen today was horrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=840.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I hear and see from this committee is just as bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=845.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that we're looking at systemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=848.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something right now that's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=851.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=852.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter doesn't want to go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=856.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where is the urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=859.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where is your urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=862.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few weeks ago, we had parents up here talking about the fear they had about their daughter being beaten up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=869.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we had a consultant and I've asked teachers, I've asked students, have you seen the change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=875.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing, nothing, nothing has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=883.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to sit back, I'm gonna speak and then I'm gonna leave because I don't want it back and forth, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=891.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're seeing with my daughter, her friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=895.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I ran up to the high school just so I could be present for her, just so I could tell her her dad's outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=905.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see over and over again, I saw Madam Superintendent, this is not an isolated incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=911.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To write that this is an isolated incident and to say publicly this is an isolating incident is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=917.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=921.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=924.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm scared, and I'm disgusted, and I feel bad for my daughter and her friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=931.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this might be not the best thing a city council should do, coming up in front of a body and expressing themselves with this motion, but I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=943.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have principals and assistant principals that are running around that school with no support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=951.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for rules that have been implemented by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=955.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Give him back the tools, give them back the tools so they can run the school system the way they see fit to keep our kids safe, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=965.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then look at your studies and then look at your consultants and see what they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=975.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll be honest with tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=976.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for an emergency meeting didn't didn't go through only three members voted for an emergency meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=982.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a forum for people don't feel like they've been heard today to be up for the city council tomorrow and express their concerns and I will be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=990.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter will not be going to school and her friends are not going to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1050.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1051.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, as a parent, you're asking me to have a back and forth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1057.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a colleague, I haven't heard one word from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1060.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't had one word from anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1062.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've publicly put this out there because we haven't heard one word from any of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1067.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, one word, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1069.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, as a former member of this body, I worked diligently to make sure that we implemented a plan to keep our children safe from bullies, not the opposite, because that's what we're feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1081.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what our kids are feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1083.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you want to see it or not, our children are telling us that they feel that you're protecting the bullies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1090.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're allowing them to run the show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1094.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you ask any kid, any child up there, they're telling me that they feel unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1100.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're telling me that they don't have the structure that they felt in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1105.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to tell me that the tensions, suspensions, well guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1109.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're saying that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1111.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not happening, it's not getting to the ones that it's happening to, because the kids are saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1117.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids are telling me that there's no suspensions, that they're not gonna get detention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1123.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids are saying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1126.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe so, but let me ask you one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1130.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had assemblies for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1132.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After that incident with that young lady, did you bring that student body in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1136.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you bring that student body in and give them security to let them feel that they would be safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1141.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you, other than Go Mustangs or emails to people that if they get to them or not, did you sit in front of the student body yourselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1151.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After that incident, look them in the eye in the gymnasium, like you did when you were all there cheering them on for the football game, and look them in the eye and say, you're safe because of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1161.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're safe because we're going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1163.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1167.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1173.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't have to be a law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1184.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that, but that doesn't mean the tact and the professionalism that you have from your teachers and administrators up there to bring the rest of the student body in and to let them know that they're in a safe environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1198.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to disclose anything, any other news about what's legally can be said and what can't be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1204.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're all educated, very bright people to sit our student body down and look them in the eye and say, you're okay and this is why it's gonna happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1212.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not asking you to disclose any information about the perpetrator, the person who was injured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1219.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1221.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let the kids know that they're safe, because you haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1225.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7455.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7473.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to express that as a city counselor, you will see resolutions from this counselor that will ask you Madam Mayor, the resolution that if you came to our, our body for funding for licensed security guides to help our principals and assistant principals to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7491.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be a resolution, there'll be another resolution that the council would like to ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7496.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Members of the school committee, the police department, our teachers that we set up a team summit, so we can work with our children so they can tell us what they want, just like the brave young men and women that were here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7509.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that will be the dialogue that needs to be started, there'll be a few others, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7514.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As Mr. Puccio said earlier, we allow our parents to monitor lunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7521.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We allow our parents to monitor different various programs throughout the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7527.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's time that we ask those parents, and myself included, that we get more involved on a daily basis at Medford High School so the kids see our faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7537.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to be the policemen, not to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7546.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: express this, the communication that I've gotten back from students and parents over the last 24 hours and before, is the understanding that we are very fortunate to have a headmaster like Paul DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7562.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paul DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7566.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Paul DeLava will be very upset because someone's talking kindly about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7571.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Paul DeLava was part of that group that when I was a school committee member, he was a coach, he was a teacher, he loves Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7580.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever was implemented after that, whatever stigma that's out there that people are portraying what that administration can do or can't do, let's try to find a way to correct it and make sure we don't lose people like Paul DeLava and his staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7597.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if we lost him right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7599.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we would be going back years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7601.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GbhjYJ_J4oE&t=59.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=99.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=100.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed of this wonderful news that we have two amazing Method residents that are sharing their 70th wedding anniversary, and I wanted just to express our deepest happiness for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=117.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that they have three very proud children, Josie, Janet, and Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=123.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanted to make sure that their parents were recognized and just an amazing accomplishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=129.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And 70 years cheesy, that is something to really to applaud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=136.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=137.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=383.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=385.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=473.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1434.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1436.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1910.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you, Councilor Behrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1913.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, again, a very popular location and it looks like everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1920.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will move approval after we hear from any questions from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2061.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2064.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question the chair on the ruling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4573.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you councilor Beas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4574.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I will share the probably the only comment that I agree with the mayor is that an override should go to the community, but if it's done right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4589.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last meeting, I posed a question about using free cash and showing the process so everybody could see what it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4600.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just for the fact that the possibility, now maybe the mayor can answer this, in November, Madam Mayor, if the override happens to fail, what happens to our school department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4630.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You usually are, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4657.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4659.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we would take that gamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4661.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4663.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll revert back to June 20th of last year during the budget meeting, when I'm sure you remember the meeting that you had with both Councilor Beaz and President Morrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4675.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as Councilor Beaz stated before, it's in the minutes, it's in the video that Councilor Beaz met with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4684.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4686.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you came to an agreement and he's going to vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4691.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did was we sold you sold because what you did is I felt like Nostradamus because as I said that night, what you're doing is going to put our city and financial ruins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4705.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4706.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4707.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that when we look at where we are today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4710.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what we talked about back a year ago, we've had one year knowing that this was gonna happen and what was created to make this less harsh for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4724.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4727.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You started a financial task force of you, the chief of staff, Council President Viz, Councilor Collins,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4738.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe vice chair Graham and the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4743.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is our financial team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4748.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talked to neighbor communities as they lunged into these proposition two and a half, I talked to Mayor Carter Toney, who informed me back in 2009 when they faced the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4762.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what neighbor communities do for, I believe the word's been thrown out there, transparent, which I think is an absolute farce being used that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4772.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they did back in 2009 to that community, they set up a financial advisory committee provided with expert advice from both savings and revenue production measures designed to help the city maintain its financial strength and face this deepening economics recession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4789.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They looked at a committee which had Samuel Tyler, president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau of Free Assistance, Jonathan Sloan, the president and co-CEO of Century Bank, Jeffrey Hartigan, senior vice president investments of UBS Financial Services, the Chamber of Commerce and leadership team from their financial team, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4818.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Daniel Richards, Professor Daniel Richards at Tufts University and in the economics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4825.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I've been saying, that we might need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4830.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4832.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why divide the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4833.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why gamble our future, our kids' future, by not doing it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4838.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4840.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We met behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4841.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sat in the meeting since I believe Councilor Beas said September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4846.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've had meetings that we've had no updates, no minutes, no notes, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4850.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Beas stated that when we get closer, he will give us all the information possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4859.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we've got, we got a message from yourself that we are now going to just jump into an override, jump into debt exclusions, and jump into very, very scary times for a lot of very vulnerable residents in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4875.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course, when I asked for debt exclusion, I worked with the best financial mind in Alicia Nunley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4881.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You remember her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4882.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Alicia Nunley, who was an award-winning budget creator,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4889.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she was, and when she broke it down for us, we eliminated senior citizens, and we eliminated veterans to see what that exclusion looked like for new fire stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4901.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the numbers were drastically different, but we were making sure we were taking care of the most vulnerable members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4908.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I asked for the other day was, when I was unceremoniously ruled 21,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4915.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and made quiet again, because what I was saying made sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4920.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Taking that money, five to $7 million out of free cash, and balancing the budget, and then working together by being more transparent and open in the process of an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4931.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You mentioned that the process, that looking at the process, it's only $440 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4944.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that's minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4945.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, that sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4948.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what's scaring our residents, maybe you're not listening to them or even hearing them, especially our most vulnerable, when you're looking at a transfer tax that was mentioned, rent control that was mentioned, a registry fee that was mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4962.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about a debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4968.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's probably $250 million debt exclusion for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4972.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who does that fall on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4975.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are homeowners, and a lot of these homeowners that some of my colleagues think that are rich because they own a home of a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4984.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'll give you an example of a person I talked to today, and when she said, George, I'm gonna be honest, this scares me, because her and her husband bought their home in Medford 60 years ago for minimal money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4998.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now their home's worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5001.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that million dollars now, because of the tax rate, now these little add-ons, as you called it, they're just small, as they keep adding on, these most vulnerable members of our community are petrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5014.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They fear where we're going with this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5018.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I would have asked you, Madam Mayor, is looking at the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5023.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and where we've been in the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5026.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we done to create new growth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5028.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we truly done to create revenue to support our streets, our sidewalks, our schools, our fire, our police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5036.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5037.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've had 340B projects that you turned your nose to that they've all walked away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5042.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars, millions of dollars in revenue through tax and through permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5051.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5052.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just that alone in three projects that we know of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5056.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this process, this is a total farce when you look at what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5062.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different processes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5065.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I mentioned, here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5070.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was mentioned on Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5073.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is probably the biggest, biggest motion, resolution to come in front of this council ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5082.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5084.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have no meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5085.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about this as a council, community, and not once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5090.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've had five meetings on a newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5096.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you're talking about affecting thousands of people, thousands of homeowners, we haven't had any discussions, except for you and your financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5107.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't seem like a financial task force at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5110.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what it reads is what it reads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5112.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if it walks like a duck, it smells like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5115.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys went in the back room, and you found the easiest way so you could be let off the hook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5121.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that is by debt exclusion to override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5125.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5127.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5129.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I showed you what other communities do, what they've done in the past, and how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5135.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked to the superintendent who came up and talked to us about making it whole, and her saying that, no, it's not going to make it whole for what we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5143.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I believe Vice Chair Graham mentioned to one of the city council, I believe in Topper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5151.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When he asked the question, if we get to 79 million, will everything be put whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5155.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5157.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent sat in front of us and said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5161.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's gonna take more money, just like you will, and put it into a black hole that we don't know where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5169.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the proof is in the pudding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5172.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our numbers aren't very good, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5175.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we look at our education numbers, we don't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5179.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5180.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we provided more funding to the school department above all other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5187.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not to say we don't need more, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5190.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's how it's managed right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5192.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a weak question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5195.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the dog and pony show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5199.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everybody patting each other on the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5201.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this was a complete joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5203.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lack of transparency, lack of communication with all members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5209.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll say it again, I don't disagree that we might need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5215.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say that from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5217.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we haven't done is we haven't done this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5222.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you've done tonight, if you caused enough divide in our community, Madam Mayor, we are now divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5228.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, I've had hundreds of people call me on both ends, 100 people saying, George, we need an override, and having great discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5236.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've also had hundreds of phone calls from people that are saying, no, this isn't good, and we're gonna fight on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5244.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So instead of sitting there together as a group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5248.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and putting it together and figure out the best course transparently, what we can do for our community, we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5255.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On June 20th, you sold your soul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5261.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This task force was put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5266.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sat here doing nothing, because you knew this was going to be nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5268.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad you could smile, miss, because you're really affecting hundreds of people's lives here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5273.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you come out and come out out of all this work, not knowing what you did, for overrides, debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5283.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I will invoke Rule 21, which states<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5295.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dispositions of all items appearing on the city council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5299.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All items of business appearing upon council agenda shall be taken up in the order their parents and fully openly debates the disposal of by vote of council previous to the consideration of any other item of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5312.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No item of business shall be referred to committee except for the following reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5317.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the study and the report of subsequent meeting, for the purpose of drafting an ordinance, and the event that open discussions may prove damaging to the character and reputation of a person or persons, all matters referred to the committee shall reappear on the council agenda for the meeting for four weeks following the referral, unless sooner presented by the committee chair or a majority not exceeding two weeks is voted by the council upon request of the committee chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5344.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: majority committee memberships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5346.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5357.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you might've suspended the rules, but I want the community to realize you stifled me last time disrespectfully shutting down rule 21 because I made sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5370.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it was a viable way for us to slow things down and do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5375.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tonight, you suspend the motion for this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5379.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Will I invoke rule 21 this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5383.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I have to, I would look into contacting our attorney and looking for an injunction to see where this goes, because I think this is a fraudulent process by the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5394.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7005.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7008.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the dialogue back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7013.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick note to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7015.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The presentation you just gave was the same presentation we heard at the debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7021.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, no shovel in the ground, no money in our accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7026.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing at Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7028.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7032.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And councilor is saying immediate funding is available when you start these projects and permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7039.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my biggest issue I'm having here is not the fact that, because people are gonna leave tonight saying councilor Scott plays against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7048.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's not what I, I've said this a thousand times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7052.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And councilor Callahan said, democracy is so important, getting the vote out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7057.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7060.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why behind closed doors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7062.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why weren't we involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7065.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would you announce it on a Friday and then bring it to the floor on a Tuesday and then vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7073.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Especially when there are viable options that we know of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7077.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7080.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can use the five to seven to do everything you said to pull in the hot strings of all the parents and kids and teachers who, by the way, are my friends, my relatives, my family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7090.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand completely, but there's an option there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7093.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then maybe step back and say, well, instead of dividing this, instead of making this a contentious situation, let's sit together and say, well, did we look at the process of eliminating seniors to this process and how much would it cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7108.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we look at eliminating veterans from the process and see how much would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7112.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7115.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Democracy isn't saying that six people in one room say it's all right and that's the way we should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7122.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's democracy, no that isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7124.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Democracy is being open and honest and being truly transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7130.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about looking at where the funding was and where the funding's gonna go because when I say the black hole, I say we were given millions and millions of dollars from ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7143.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we do with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7144.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing to show for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7145.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Infrastructure needs, it was the airport, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7148.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could get angry all you want, Madam Mayor, and turn your head, but you made some pretty snide comments tonight, and it's pretty embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7154.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, I will tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7158.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You put on this paper, excuse me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7163.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, Madam, I believe you said it was that we needed to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7171.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that were getting jobs illegally or questionable, and you were cleaning up City Hall, you've used that comment a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7183.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I tell you what, I'd like to sit down at these meetings and say, well, look what they've done in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7188.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where did the funding go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7189.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7190.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how do we fix it moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7193.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used in consultants, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7195.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used for investigators, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7198.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we spent on for legal fees in the hundreds of thousands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7204.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used in settlements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7207.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are millions of dollars that we wasted because you put a cape on and thought that was your job, and that wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7214.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the courts, obviously now we're hearing it and we're seeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7218.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will be honest with you, again, it would have been nice to have some time to sit with the community and figure out, or at least all the council, because it seems like six people know what they're doing in the council, but there's one person sitting back saying, well, I had questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7236.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had things to offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7238.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I came out and started sharing that on the council floor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7244.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was pushed by asking me to put the amendment first, then I was asked to verify comments, and then when it started getting heavy and it started making sense, we sectioned 21-me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7258.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we get to tonight where I think we do need breathing room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7262.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need another week to look at this, to look at this and ask some questions and make sure people, through the democracy, the process of democracy, that people ask these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7274.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can pat yourselves on the back all you want of this task force, and you came to this agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7279.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to present all the information from this hardworking task force that was presented to the public on a Thursday or Friday, and then brought out for a vote tonight, is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7292.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really, this isn't the way democracy works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7296.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know if you, deep down inside, I think all of you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7301.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7305.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a lot of people do want to speak, and again, I'm just going to leave off with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7310.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a mechanism in place that could have taken care of our children, our teachers, our parents, all these coaches and teachers that you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7319.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through free cash, which we had millions because of the process that was mismanagement of finances in our community for the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7328.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And an abundance of that much money is just bringing it back to who deserves it, and that's the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7333.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, that's the taxpayers' money that weren't spent correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7338.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we have an option now to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7342.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of doing that, we're gonna rush through a vote tonight, which it's sad to say I will vote no, not for the fact that Councilor Scott Kelly doesn't think that we possibly could use an override, but we didn't do it the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7357.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did it behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7359.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you wanna say it was a great process, whether you wanna say it was transparent, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7366.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7419.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have no city solicitor, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7460.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever puts you to sleep, Madam Mayor, every night, that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7463.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I sat next to you for four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7467.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7467.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I respect you, then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7471.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7476.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I just want to remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7479.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want the mayor to remember that I remember that person that sat next to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7484.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she wouldn't deal with what's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7486.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7488.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever puts you to sleep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7827.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7830.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can point a personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7834.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7835.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say this to all due respect, whatever Mr. President makes my colleague feel good, but what he did was stifle the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7844.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7845.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked questions as the chair of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7849.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I answered your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7850.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did not rule it out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7852.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move forward with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7854.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it started getting uncomfortable, my colleague shut me down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7859.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7860.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why I shut it down tonight is because it just doesn't matter because the process is already through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7870.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're asking for, and what I was asking for, was never entertained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7875.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It couldn't have been entertained, Mr. Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7880.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if I said what I needed to say tonight, it would have needed time for the administration to look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7886.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7888.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking at an override and taking senior citizens out of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7893.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Councilor Collins has mentioned over and over again, that's transparent and there were notes and all due respect for the vice president, Mr. President, those not the questions that we had, or I had, or the people that I represent had out of those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7911.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what we had was the options of doing A, B, or C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7915.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with those options comes processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7918.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, we need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7922.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, were there any other options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7924.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if we did do an override, what would it look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7929.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what my questions were going to be driven through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7935.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8590.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, uh, counselor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8594.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I asked for debt exclusion, the finance director at the time, Alicia Nunley did a study that excluded our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8604.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my comment tonight would have been through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8609.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would have been interesting to see before we got to this point, if seniors could have been excluded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8617.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, but I, I believe there's council bears says it's, it's a mass law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8622.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe there is a process that you can work with the state to get that exempt by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8627.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14300.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you repeat that again, Council President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14301.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14332.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14366.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14372.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14422.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14545.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14595.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14747.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15185.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15189.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also appreciate the resolution because it definitely is something that we should understand and with a little compassion, but to what relates to the proposed site, I think it's also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15212.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: conversations I've had with former addicts and, um, and people that were once on methadone that really stressed to me that, uh, the location is, um, is something that should be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15226.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, to help the city find a location, um, that would be suitable, but, um, in the area that's being requested where it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15238.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a few blocks from the school, across the street from the dance studio, a park right down the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15245.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are some concerns there for the residents and the parents of the Roberts school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15254.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that has to come into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15257.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15259.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, like again, this isn't coming arbitrarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15262.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is coming from discussions that I've had with, uh, with addicts themselves and who've, who've told me that it should be in a place because, uh, there are some serious concerns there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15275.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, although I appreciate my fellow council bringing this forward and I feel for, uh, and respect, um, a resolution at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15286.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, in the same breath is understanding that, um, having the location in part of the community that could negatively affect so many, um, we have to look at their well being as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15301.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16944.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16946.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NkdSQu8o7Y4&t=91.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody was against the process of helping people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NkdSQu8o7Y4&t=96.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what everybody was looking for was making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential inhabitants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=677.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=680.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every community should have a Tom Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=682.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I admire Tom for his conviction of what he believes in, and Tom was the person that fought for what he believed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=691.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if anybody wants to know why the Brooks Estates is still standing and why it's still a great piece of our community, it's because of Tom Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=701.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't wait to see him and shake his hand and thank him because he put a lot of time and effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=708.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are many, many nights that we would butt heads and not agree, but we would always respect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=717.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I admire what he did for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=720.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully someone's ready to pick up that torch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=723.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=947.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say some nice things So we have known your family a long time and I just want to commend you and thank you and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=964.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's people like Sylvia that kept Medford moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=967.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know people think today's times might be a little difficult, but I remember some really tough times in Medford, and it's the people that made this building what it was and what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=980.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's people like yourself that I personally am gonna miss, and it's like, I think that it's a piece of history that'll be walking out the door, but at the same time, you left a legacy here that I hope<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=993.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: everybody would follow because you've done an amazing job for our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=998.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that this is going to sound bad, but I know you get paid every week and not a lot, but what you gave to us is priceless and we thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1008.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for everything you've done for the city and enjoy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1479.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1480.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Janice DePace, I've known Janice for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1485.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember her children participating in sports, and I remember teaching with Janice while she was at Medford High School, and now she's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1498.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on to bigger and better things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1500.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1501.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's just a great person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1502.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you know Janice DePace, she has a smile on her face and a special word for you just to keep, just to make sure you have a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1509.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was like that with her students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1511.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that everybody that crossed her path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1514.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So she'll be missing the clerk's office, but she's earned an amazing retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1520.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1837.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1839.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To the Babe Ruth and Willie Mays of the teaching profession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1846.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna thank Mrs. Lasky because I had the honor not only to be a parent of a child in her class, but also a colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1855.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were the pinnacle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1859.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were what everybody wanted to aspire to as colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1863.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you never, you never wavered in your emotions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1872.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were just a great teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1875.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were there for every single child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1877.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know the impact you made in my child's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1880.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, dad's an elected official, but my son could care less about politics until he ran for fourth grade president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1890.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he woke up one morning with a suit on and he says, dad, can you hold this behind me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1895.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1896.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He said, it's American flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1897.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1898.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, I'm going to give my speech with someone holding the American flag behind me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1902.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, how come you didn't carry it with what dad's doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1906.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, you weren't in Miss Lasky's class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1908.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to Justin's point, I remember when he came home one day, he met Mr. Lasky and he says, I know what I want to do for my future, dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1918.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, why, what do you want to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1919.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, I met Mr. Lasky, and I want to be the reason why we clean Mystic the lake so we can all swim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1927.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just those impacts that we made, the growth and respect to our environment, the little lessons that became huge lessons today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1941.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you from the bottom of my heart because it takes a village to raise your children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1944.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were very fortunate, the Scott Pelley household, to have you as one of our children's teachers and teaching them from right and wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1952.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1954.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You earned the retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1956.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's a huge void at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1958.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember when we started, that was the A-Team, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1961.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be in the same breath<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1963.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as you know, I think was by default with my position, but to be in the same breath as when they called the 18 and talk and stand side by side with Don Alaska gave me a sense of pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1973.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1974.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all your work and enjoy the retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1978.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2015.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would like, if we can, Mr. President, is bring Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2017.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lasky back, and we send her off with one of those wonderful citations that you draw up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be great if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2025.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2026.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe invite the whole Lasky family, because I know we haven't seen them for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2031.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2132.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2133.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We recently lost an amazing person from an amazing Medford family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2141.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had Lauren Kane passed away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2143.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that didn't know Lauren, Lauren was an unassuming but very powerful figure in our community for the fact when being a police officer, a female police officer, wasn't the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2161.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she took that job with such pride and such vigor that she started as a young person, as a teacher, and then moved on to be a police officer, and then moved on to hold<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2173.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to hold huge positions with the drug enforcement team and making sure that she played a huge impact in making sure that drugs weren't being distributed to our youth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2189.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she worked for the DEA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2191.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She worked for the city of Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2193.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most of all, she worked here for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2196.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's a sad day for, uh, the method police department that they lost one of their own and, uh, she will definitely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2205.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would ask that we send our condolences to the cane family for, um, for a person who really gave her life for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2214.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, we may she rest in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2217.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2556.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2837.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2838.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So first I want to commend the neighbors and the residents that really pulled together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2845.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you see in front of you is what happens when you see that something might affect our neighborhood in a negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2855.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I found amazing is I went to an organization, a group of neighbors put together a meeting at the Fireman's Club, and I think probably about 130 people showed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2866.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we heard from everybody there with respect and honor to every individual involved was that nobody was against the process of helping people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2879.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what everybody was looking for is making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2894.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amazing to see the community rally around this and really start a grassroots quick organization to really rally around and just educate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2906.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2908.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have, what I realized in those conversations, there were some people very angry at George Scapelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2915.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and deservedly so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2918.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something that we talked about with our leadership team here that when we did the recodification of our zoning and we implemented these type of facilities in the medical field, in the zoning process, that it was then going to go to a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2937.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We realized the impact it could have now legally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2942.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the facility like a methadone, and people keep saying clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2947.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what really brought a lot of people to their feet was it's not a clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2950.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There weren't people there to assist people that were addicted, but it was just a distribution site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2958.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2959.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had people that were involved that were both former recovering addicts, and we talked to administrators in the field, and they really shared an input that really educated a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2974.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, at the end of the discussion, it wasn't that, let's keep these people out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2980.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it was, if it's needed in Medford, let's find a location where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2986.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they can get their help and the support, but at the same time not affect a residential area that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2992.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Feeds away from a dance studio, a school, the lack of parking in that area affecting small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3001.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there were a lot of little intricacies that played a huge part in what that neighborhood, the effects it would have had in the Salem Street neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I had some issues because we wanted to make sure that without a city solicitor, I reached out to the mayor this weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3023.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She had an attorney that's well-versed in these topics to call me to make sure that we didn't say something that would get us in trouble later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3033.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that with this motion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3037.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as this process started moving forward, you saw that everybody was listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3042.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw that every department in the city was listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3045.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor was listening, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3047.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Appeals said, one of the biggest questions was, well, how do we make this a hybrid meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3053.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there are people that couldn't make a Zoom meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3056.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So making it, opening it up to everybody in the community so everybody had an input in this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3066.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion tonight would still be for a moratorium moving forward, but working directly with Mrs. Hunt and the mayor's office and making sure that we look at our zoning to make sure that any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3084.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any facilities under this criteria are moved into non-residential areas where it won't affect our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3093.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, there's still a process, but that would be my recommendation and my resolution if we can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3101.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the meetings are hybrid, so everybody can still attend those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3108.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3109.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I can't thank<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3114.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This sometimes is elected official, you look back and you say, geez, with this process, sometimes being a politician, you get, you know, your colleagues have one way of thinking, you have another way of thinking, and kind of get a little discouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3127.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing you do know is that you all love the city of Medford, and we're all fighting for the right reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3134.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I saw<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3136.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this past week with community members rallying together to make sure everybody was heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3143.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I loved, there was, you know, I'm getting phone calls from young people that have young children in the schools that just moved to Method a few years ago, but in the same breath, they were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3156.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: introducing me to their 88-year-old neighbor that they were making sure that they felt comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3161.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3163.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really took care of our neighbors with this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3166.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to say this again because we talked about this issue too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3171.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This wasn't to divide at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3172.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that people are looking at social media and saying, this part of the city is saying, suck it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3177.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This part of the city is saying this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3179.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These people are saying that, you know, shame on you for not wanting to take care of people that need support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3185.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3187.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With everybody I talked to, it was an open mind, but with the goal of making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3193.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These types of facilities are located in the community that doesn't affect our residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3201.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I give them all the respect and pats on the back that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3209.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate this company that realized that maybe this isn't the way to go and didn't want to continue with the fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3223.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For now, Salem Street is in a better place right now because there were a lot of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3230.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it wasn't just what people would think that with the methadone distribution site coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3237.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People were concerned about the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3239.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People were concerned about the small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3243.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people were concerned about that whole corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3245.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it was really expressed in a mature, responsible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3253.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: diplomatic and not divisional conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3258.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3259.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, I am so impressed with, and as I move forward, I'll put a motion through Mr. President later on, that we convene a community engagement committee that brings in the talent we have in our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3279.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, there are some amazing people that are in the field of addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3286.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are amazing people that are engineers, and there's amazing people that work with traffic studies, and there are doctors, and there are legal minds that really came out and shared their expertise for the greater good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3302.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to be negative, not to go one way or the other, but really to share an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3308.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend everybody here for being here and following through with something that they knew that was going to impact their neighborhood and this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3316.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to see that a wrong is righted and we'll be working hopefully after we pass this resolution that we work with the mayor's office and the community development team and really try to change that zoning so we're not in this position again that we're making sure that if it's needed then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3337.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we'll have a location where it's not gonna impact the community like it has in last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3341.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3343.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3951.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to clear clarity with the Council, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3957.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have the Council, we have a representative that the city had hired to work directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3965.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3967.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, what I put in as a motion is legally, um, you know, acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3973.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to put something in that's going to negatively affect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4129.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we could just move forward and send this to the subcommittee in zoning and we stop the process as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4148.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think we eliminate the moratorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4150.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've taken that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4151.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we restructure the motion to ask to refer this to the zoning, our subcommittee in zoning to draw up the legal and proper terminology to move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4165.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4222.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, can you give us some guidance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4223.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have residents that have worked very hard on this issue that want to be heard tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4228.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there's a possibility that they can express their input and their time and effort they put into this, I would recommend or ask that you would allow them to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4251.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so if you want to speak on this, you'll have to wait at the end now to public participation, and you can speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4589.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're in a good place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4592.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this is productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4593.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're in a recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4594.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8238.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10550.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to make that a point that was mentioned, questioned by a few residents via phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10561.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10571.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make the motion that we approve the special permit and with the 30, 60, 90 day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11184.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11186.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11188.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we are committed to support the CPA, I think that there's some clarity maybe you can help with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11194.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when we first voted for this, it was a matching number by the state, correct, at the time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11202.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It still is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11203.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we seen that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11204.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we getting that money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11205.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We receive it every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how much is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11242.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's 14% this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11249.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scrivner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12816.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all your work, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12817.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12818.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions that residents called me and they're just concerned that yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12823.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, and I appreciate the developers and having that control, but the conversations I had with a few neighbors that here are a few homes that aren't in the historical realm, and they would need approval to change the color of their house or a window frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12842.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they've told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12843.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe we can dispel those rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12883.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's, with developers, listen, I support this and I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12889.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what I'm hearing is just the neighbors that are saying, what's recommended for materials if they had to make a change in their home and they're living on a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12902.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how that could relate to their processes if they needed something to be remodeled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12907.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the biggest concern and where it falls in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12911.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that really hasn't been delineated for, okay, this home was built in 1974 and they want to replace some windows and the windows might not fit in the criteria that we might be looking at with the commission, but it's affordable for the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12931.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sure so i think that that's my biggest concern with this i don't think that i've heard that it we've been saying that it's been recommended but if they say no what are the ramifications um well i was gonna put this on the slide but but but um we've actually never said no okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12957.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But how long are you going to be there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12962.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12977.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12978.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like I said, I think that what you're doing and what we're doing that in that neighborhood for years, I mean, and I know that, you know, for my friend sharing music, who is a strong proponent and former former school commember with myself and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12993.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, I know the passion she had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12994.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not like I said, it's not, this isn't something that I would talk against because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12999.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that the biggest piece is that everyone has the neighbors that are concerned that many people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13044.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you and I appreciate who's here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13047.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear is if we're putting the disordinates in, it's the next group that comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13051.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they come in and they have a hard line and they're like, no, we're not gonna do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13054.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you get to control who.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13058.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, no, we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14808.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14810.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last week, I know we had a very informative meeting on the budget a few weeks ago when we talked about the processes and where this money is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14820.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we voted for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14826.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and an override that put forth the onus on the children in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14835.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I put forth a recommendation to look at free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14840.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We then noticed that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14845.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were informed that in this packet that we've now have $9 million added to that free cash to roughly $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14853.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm curious, when you went through this process, did the financial task force identify, did they know about that $9 million as it's going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14877.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that my fellow councils, we have five money papers in front of us, and they, I believe, what was it you implemented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14891.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the rules to avoid Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14896.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will do this with all the papers tonight, but as my right, I'm invoking state law under Chapter 43, Section 22, which reads, Section 22, any ordinance or order or resolution may be passed through all stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the Council objects thereto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14917.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14921.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to vote that right for the fact that we're pushing things through and we're not getting the information, at least this council is not getting the information they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14930.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a tactic that's very silly that we're going to try to get information that was passed, that was information that was given to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14939.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I made sure that we reached out to the state legal department and they said, any budget paper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14946.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is invoked, our ordinance is invoked, then I can supersede that with the state ordinance until I, as one city council, who finds this process so faulty, and so smelling with the lack of transparency, that we're so confused of where this money is coming from, and I've used this many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14973.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're all very bright people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14975.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying anybody's doing anything illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14979.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm telling you this is financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14981.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for a $7.5 million override on the fare of our families and children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14987.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to propose a $5 million free cash proposal that eliminate that fare, then the community can look to see whether we need an override or not, which I wouldn't oppose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14998.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But instead, we required it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15001.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was stifled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15003.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we moved to the next meeting, which was the budget meeting, and we had similar questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15009.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we move to the next meeting, we come up with $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15014.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have $34 million in free cash, with an override still hanging out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15021.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we still nervous about the kids in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15023.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I have the right to invoke this rule, and I do so, and I will do with all money papers tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15029.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15045.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been instructed by legal industry that this is a money paper that I can implement at my disposal, in my discretion, and I do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15055.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I question the chair, if you wanna stretch this out even longer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15067.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am opposing rule 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15085.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15086.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15087.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15089.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to play the game, so I'm playing the game with you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15092.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15093.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's kind of funny that when you want to talk about information, I've implemented my right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15157.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you want, I've questioned the chair, I've put in the rule moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15183.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15184.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The rule is not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15186.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15187.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15190.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you pulled this last week, I did my due diligence to make sure that the information is getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15195.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, we can have five meetings in subcommittee about a newsletter, but you wanna take these motions on money papers and force it down people's throat without giving it its due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15207.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15306.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll text you, Ken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15307.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15308.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15313.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you talked to the administration for $9 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15320.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 20, the July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15325.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You agree to call on Bob anytime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18136.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=110.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=111.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a sad day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=115.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we heard the passing of probably one of the finest teachers to ever grace the hallways in the Memphis Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=125.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Robin Irving was a very special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=129.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She made it her life's mission to take care of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=133.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's over 40 years of service, and Robin fought the fight against cancer and lost her battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=145.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's ironic that today's her 70th birthday, and I know that the family has put together a GoFundMe page to make sure her name carries on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=155.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in her name to scholarships for deserving children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=157.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanted to mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=160.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was an amazing person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=162.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had many friends that had Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=165.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving, and when they talked about Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=168.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving, as if they had a mother out of their home, someone that took care of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=173.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when I was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=177.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: awarded the position to be a McGlynn Elementary Phys Ed teacher, I was honored to work on the other side of the door of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=185.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=186.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you ever went by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=187.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving's room, you know that she was a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=194.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She had everything she needed for every kid with every single lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=200.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was tough, there was times she was tough, but everybody respected her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=205.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we heard the sad news, I'm not less of a man to say, but I cried in my truck because she was one of the good ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=215.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just wanted to reach out to her family, especially her nieces and nephews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=222.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know how much she loved them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=226.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And send our deepest condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=228.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a person that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=231.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you wanna name a library after, or you wanna name, leave someone's name to show their legacy, Robin Irving's the teacher that deserves that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=244.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So goodbye, my friend, happy birthday, my friend, and thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=734.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The point of my resolution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=738.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Councilman and I use the words transparency and accountability very often, and I do too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=743.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These words count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=747.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the count only if we not only talk the talk, but we walk the walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=752.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As this City Council is well aware, I submitted a letter to the Attorney General and the State Auditor's Office expressing my concerns over the way the City Council has used Rule 21 in Mass General Law, C-43, Section 22, unfairly and in a self-serving way to eliminate the discussion of resolutions that call for the expenditure of millions upon millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=780.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When papers from the mayor were before the city council on June 7th, the council suspended the rules and approved the motion that the council rule 21 not be allowed to be invoked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=792.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then on June 25th, my request to invoke Mass General Law C-43, section 22, which allows any one council to postpone consideration of a paper for one week was ruled out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=807.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At both of those meetings, my hope was that we could have an appropriate amount of time to discuss these significant issues and also receive input from our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=818.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the council leadership ruled my request out of order, I had no choice but to bring this to the attention of the proper state offices to receive their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=829.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state auditor's office responded to me quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=833.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and reviewed my requests and explained first the requirements of the majority of the city council and the agreement of the mayor to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=841.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's the simple part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=844.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this council feels confident that its actions of those two meetings were correct, then your confidence in your actions can be reflected in your yes vote to allow this review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=858.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be true transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=861.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If however, you're not confident that the council's action were correct, you should still vote yes for this review because then we will have guidance from the state as opposed to an opinion bought and paid for by attorneys hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=877.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be true transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=880.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: However, if you vote no on this resolution, it will show the residents of our city that this council uses the words transparency and accountability as a punchline that is empty and deceptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=896.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now is the time to stand up for what you say you believe in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=902.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let everyone know the only thing greater than your hollow words is your cowardice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=907.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, I will ask as a form of a motion that we vote to send this to be reviewed by the auditor, state auditor's office to look at our finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=920.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'll say it publicly again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=922.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have not one time mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=926.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that there is someone doing something illegal with the city's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=929.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My questions have been and stymied for one factor, one factor only, financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=939.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move that question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1213.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1639.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me make it very clear then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1643.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In both the letter and in the resolution, I asked for examination on everything possible, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1650.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I want the examination of our city finances, and I'll be meeting tomorrow with the Attorney General's office and talking about the legalities of the processes we have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1664.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, it's funny, Mr. President, that my fellow counselors mentioned some pretty outrageous comments, like as this was something that wouldn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1677.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1679.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last four meetings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1684.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe you don't have YouTube, but Councilor Lennon made sure everybody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1688.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our meetings are on YouTube now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1690.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Watch those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1692.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1694.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You tell me about working together and council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1699.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny that you talk about disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1703.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course we've had disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1705.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course we sat across an issue and one lost and one won.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1709.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1710.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But never, ever, ever has a sitting council been silenced the way this council has silenced me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1725.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no different than Councilor Callahan speaking about, it seems to fit the narrative whenever it suits your mission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1735.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I remember when we had an issue concerning a legality dealing with a newsletter, and I said something very simple in regards also to the letter that was sent out to the state regarding the transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1751.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1753.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made a motion that we ask for an opinion from our legal team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1757.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe you voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1759.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe all of you voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1762.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that stymied the talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1764.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That stymied the process that you yourself just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1770.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you sit back and you start talking and you're spewing to the public that this is divisive, that this isn't true, oh, these are all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1780.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These aren't made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1783.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You suspended the rules so rule 21 could not be invoked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1790.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were talking about millions and millions of dollars that this council got on a Friday and voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1799.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what you talk about transparency and accountability?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1802.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1803.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of walking it through with this open, deliberate conversation, as you just well stated, we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1811.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We shut it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1813.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We disrespected this councilor and my ability to work for not the 7,000 people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1822.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not for the 7,000 people that elected you when you knocked on their doors, but when I put my hand up and I swore to uphold the rules and regulations and laws of this city, I represent all 60,000 members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1843.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit back and spew this disingenuine dialogue that these are lies, that what I'm saying is mistruths, these are situations risen on the fact that you, as the leadership team of this council, you stymied the process of open discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1863.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1865.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You forced me to go out and ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1868.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In regards to my fellow counselor reaching out to the art of his office, great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1874.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I forwarded our city clerk the email that was sent, so I could share that with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1881.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When did you forward that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1882.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1882.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just got it, so I just forwarded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1884.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good morning, Councilor Scott Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1886.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for your correspondence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1888.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In order for our office to examine these issues, we would need the request for the city of Memphis itself, and then it broke down, which Councilor Callahan so eloquently said, it's the vote of the council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1901.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it's the vote of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1903.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yes, the city would have to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1906.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And oh, by the way, yes, the city does do an audit every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1914.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions that I would have brought up that evening and the previous meetings before that, that I was silenced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1920.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We looked at situations where we had millions of dollars in other avenues that we can make our school system whole to protect our students, our teachers, and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1930.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I was stunned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1932.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then the following week, we got the email, right, that we just found another $9 million, $9 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1943.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1945.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's an opportunity to openly discuss, transparently, with accountability, discuss this process and say, where did it come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1955.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did this happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1958.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why can't we use this to support the education process now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1962.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what has happened, maybe you stick with your 7,000 people you knock on their doors, but you've woken up this community to the fact that whether you believed in an override or you didn't, people are questioning this community's process of fiscal mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1981.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1990.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to call this, sorry, not Council President, to call these allegations, I think it's just disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1997.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These aren't allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1999.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're saying in actuality, what I put out there, what I've tried to say for the last four meetings were lies and I made them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2009.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's simply not true, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2011.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm ashamed that you even brought that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2013.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could go to every single meeting and watch it yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2017.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I had were questions that my constituents, our constituents in the city of Medford, were asking me for answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2027.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all it could have been, even that evening, when we questioned yours and Council President Bezos' signatures with your titles on that letter that supported a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2039.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All that could have been done was a simple yes vote, voted to legal, them telling me this is what it is, Councilor Scott Pelley, and we moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2048.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I have an answer for multiple constituents that called me about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2053.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than this situation or what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2058.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made it a mockery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2060.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The night of the budget was a mockery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2062.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about a disgrace in a Zoom, in a show?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2065.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2067.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mail with the snide comments and the linking back and forth, disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2072.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2073.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2074.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys look perplexed like this never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2077.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go back to YouTube and watch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2080.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead and watch it because it's disgusting and it's appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2083.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit back and call this, these allegations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2088.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I protested that vehemently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2091.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2093.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you forced me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2102.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2104.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We sent the letter to the attorney general and the auditor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2108.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The attorney general hasn't gotten back to me yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2109.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll meet him tomorrow, we hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2113.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor's office responded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2117.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The response that I got that I shared explained the hows and the what to dos with this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2127.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this motion has come up that we vote on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2132.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: passing this over to the mayor, having the mayor make a decision, sending it to the auditor's office, and then having them come in to look and see, not what the audit that we're seeing done when everything is prepared, but at the end of the year, when we find $9 million of mismanagement funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2152.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's unheard of, because as most people in this administration love to do, they contact neighborhood communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2159.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They love to put these charts up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2161.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2163.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The average increase in free cash in neighboring communities are no more than $4 to $5 million, and that's excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2171.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2176.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you people stifled me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2178.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You shut me down that we couldn't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2182.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those aren't allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2184.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2185.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2186.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2188.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know when this comes out, I know that it hurts me, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2193.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hurts me because I was voted just like all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2197.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was voted, but when I took the seat, I made sure whether a person agreed with me or not, that I made a decision what I think was best for the whole community, all 60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2210.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But from what we hear from my fellow councilors, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2213.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2215.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2217.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll go to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2218.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I'm very clear on the vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2220.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's examination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2221.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the motion to have the auditor, this council, to vote to allow the state to come in and put through an audit through the state to see where we are and what's been happening with our funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2235.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2236.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, moving forward with the Attorney General's office, we'll see what they say about the management and the style that this Council President used over the last few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2250.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That has been an absolute atrocious display of leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2254.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'll come out in the next meeting, and I'll make sure I'm a little clearer for everybody when the Attorney General answers those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2262.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2263.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2281.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got the letter the morning I sent it through the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2284.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2285.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2286.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the response from the, the response from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2292.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor, I had it this week, and I forwarded tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2297.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You forwarded at what time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2299.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2300.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2301.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2301.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2304.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so that's what you're going to win on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2305.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's how you're going to play the gutter ball, you've got me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2308.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2308.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've got me, bud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2309.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2310.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2354.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2355.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2357.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the law between the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2358.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2360.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2362.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2363.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2364.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2366.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2368.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You obviously don't know who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2370.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2371.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2372.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please recognize the law that indicates that I'm the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2375.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2447.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When not, I'm going to Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2837.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2838.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3484.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3486.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to address a couple of the comments that people use my name directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3490.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On that first meeting, when we started the discussion talking about possibly using the free cash and being stymied, and then stopping that conversation because we all knew the process the following week would be the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3509.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next meeting would be to talk about the budget and possibly vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3515.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we attended the next following meeting, which allows me to then discuss that resolution that I put forth, I took it off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3527.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took it off the table to eliminate the nonsense that was already passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3537.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The idea to send a resolution through and explain the resolution, the option of thought process of one counselor, who by the way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3546.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understands that sometimes it's inconvenient for people that come to a vote to 100 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3553.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have the responsibility of thousands of people and making sure that we're doing our due diligence with all of the finances and all the financial questions we have, that I took it off the table because it was too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3571.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion that was presented the week before was to discuss the process so we can sit with the mayor and understand the process and get some answers so we can move it forward one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3584.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was stymied, that was stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3587.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it wasn't that I stopped that meeting because of lack of transparency or didn't want to openly discuss something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3596.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a moot point, we moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3599.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything I said there eliminated anything we could do because the mayor was ready to move on her votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3606.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand that, that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3610.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, let me share some shocking, sometimes the administration doesn't tell us the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3622.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you realize that even though you rushed the vote, even though we realized we got information about finances no more than a few days prior to that, that there were still multiple layoffs and we lost many, many teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3639.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3644.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3646.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could have waited and move this out a week after and got the information that all of our citizens wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3652.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not the 200 people that were here that found babysitters, but everybody, that's our responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3659.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3662.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made a choice to service the people that service you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3668.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's blatant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3671.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You talk about, Councilor Seng talks about just picking up the phone, call the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3679.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't trust the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3685.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They work for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3688.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say I don't trust the departments, I speak with the rank and file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3694.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they privately talk to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3698.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can't use their names because they're afraid of what goes up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3702.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not throwing fuel on a fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3705.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3707.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You brought up the question why I simply didn't go to these department heads and talk to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3712.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3714.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The key words in my resolution are transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3720.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I want something to be transparent, I'm going to bring it up here in front of all of these people so they all understand the process, not sit in a director's office that they can appease your agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3736.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3738.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you said it yourself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3740.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said it yourself, that was a very important meeting for the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3744.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a very important meeting during the budget to get that approved because there was fear that teachers were gonna be laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3753.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simply not the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3756.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, this is a simple, simple resolution as I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3765.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just to send this off to the auditor and get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3770.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a true indication of what the financial mismanagement that I see and others see, that we get the answers that are needed and required as we move forward, especially when you're talking about what you were asking for in November, when you talk about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3785.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's very important that we get the message out so everybody doesn't make a decision out of anger or lack of knowledge or lack of what was done during the budget season, because that's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3801.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3803.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Say whatever you want, but that's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3807.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why this community is so divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3811.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't, this is just one council standing up to make sure that the whole community is listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3819.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the 200 people that showed up for meeting and they were gonna be inconvenienced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3823.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because honestly, I know all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3826.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know you're very bright people and we've talked a lot<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3830.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I talked to you privately and I said, realistically, y'all given information about $9 million on a Friday, without talking to anybody, even okay, we talked to the directors, but then we go to move on a vote on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3849.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Truly, that is definitely not enough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3851.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been doing this long enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3853.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not enough time to get the answers that this community deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3859.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3862.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what was said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3865.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, this is the process of the council, and the process of the council, you went through with the letter of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3872.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You motioned it, you voted it, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3876.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, say what you want, Council Vance, we worked together, and the council's working together in the room right now, broke a rule that we can use against transparency and open dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3888.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Never would have done that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3889.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have lost the vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3892.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have lost the vote, but it was understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3894.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And same here, hey, when I sit and I lose a vote, I take it and move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3899.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to be stymied, that's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4475.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4480.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4483.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I just have one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4484.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4486.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to expand on what Councilor Callahan mentioned about the process and how everybody was here that night and they were so excited about the override and giving the voice to the people first time voting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4504.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you remember the conversation and if you remember the dialogue that was set forth in my motions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4511.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was the fact that we had a financial task force that we didn't see or understand how they got to that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4522.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't see how they showed us why we need an override, what got us to that override, and what are we gonna do in the next steps to make sure that we don't need another override the following year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4534.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4535.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a transparent process that we were asking for that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4540.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course people came up and voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4542.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course they want to be told that we should go on to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4546.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4548.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're not listening to the people that are right in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4552.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As many of those people that came up and said, we're for it, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4557.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have the same amount of people that are telling you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4560.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4562.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're not hearing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4564.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find it a little disturbing that the process of silencing or discussing or transparency or accountability would have come out in those meetings and discussions when we had the opportunity before the votes came out and understood, okay, the financial task force met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4585.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no minutes, no understanding how they got to where they did, but we're gonna come out with a $7.5 million override, a $30 million debt exclusion, which by the way, you're gonna be shocked when the firefighters come knocking pretty soon, and the understanding that not just a week later, we find $9 million more in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4611.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That alone, if that doesn't open your eyes and say, well, geez, Councilor Scott Pelley, eliminate all the negative banter, eliminate one side or the other, geez, that's exactly what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4622.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yeah, maybe we should look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4627.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though, Councilor Seng said it, you just said it, people came to that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4631.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course they were in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4633.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the problem was the people that had questions weren't listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4638.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a lack of transparency and accountability, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4641.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4643.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4646.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you might be confused in the verbiage that I'm sending the auditor, but let me simplify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4651.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking the auditor, with our vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4657.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to look at our city's finances, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4662.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll move forward with the Attorney General after I speak with them tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4666.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe they have something to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4668.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this isn't a very difficult, you can make this a convoluted resolution and be very confusing just because you wanna sign it, but it's a very, to everybody, it's a very simple process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4679.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My resolution states that we ask the state auditor by a city council vote and then the mayor's approval<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4685.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to come in and look at the city's finances because I question the process of millions of dollars in free cash and the process of how we got to certain votes when it comes to a financial task force that didn't have minutes to explain to the public what's happened to this community financially, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4707.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4707.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4833.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, one more last comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4838.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring this point up so we can all understand this, that one of my number one motives of moving to free cash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4847.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not leaving it up to a vote, is that during subcommittee, a resident asked a very poignant, moving question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4856.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happens if the override fails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4861.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Bear stated, it'll be absolutely devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4865.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be massive layoffs in our education process, not word for word, Council President, but it'll be a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4874.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My process was saying, why gamble right now with a total future and not using the free cash that we had in front of us, and then work together as a community to look at other options, but we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5340.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Donna, are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5358.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eileen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5368.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eileen, I'm requesting to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5457.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, um, jessica healy full lock road i'm just wondering why there's really even a Issue with having an outside auditor come in from the state I supported a hundred percent And we did just hear from a lawyer who also agrees so i'm not sure why this Has been such a big deal and all this arguing over just having someone come in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5483.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that use our tax money and pay them to do an audit to be very transparent and put everything to rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5490.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think everyone would just like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5493.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5904.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President, if I can, just to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5912.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5914.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5916.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've talked about the audit that's done every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5920.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that, the piece that we really would benefit from, from the state audit, isn't just, the audit that we get every year is the figure, the money line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5932.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it comes out, like I said, I don't question<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5936.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's being used fraudulently in the sense that it's illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5941.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My questions I have, and something that the state auditor's office will do, is audit the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5947.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not only the figure, but the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5950.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what we're seeing with being the biggest issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5953.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the audit comes in and they say, yep, all the numbers add up when you add up the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5958.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when the year is over, when the year is over and the mayor presents $9 million,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5964.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process has to be investigated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5966.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6031.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council might've known, but the financial team, they definitely knew there was $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=31.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=251.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=15.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tonight, we have to thank my team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=18.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so many of them, but I want to thank everybody that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=21.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're from all Medford, if you could just raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=23.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just thanking you for being here tonight and helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=26.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=31.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a few events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=32.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know tonight's a tough, tough night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=33.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we had about three different events tonight, but we said we need to do something because things are happening really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=42.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason that we're here is because we wanted to talk about the Proposition 2.5 override and the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=48.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are three questions that will be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=52.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you some more information later on after a few people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=58.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one is the debt exclusion, which is for a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=66.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very fortunate that we have one of our union leaders from the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=71.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Danielle Masolino is going to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=72.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's going to speak in a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=74.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And proud to say someone that I called and asked his opinion because I think he is probably<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=82.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the smartest educational mind, at least in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=87.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's someone that I respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=89.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sad to say, I don't think people respect him enough until that person's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=94.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I called this gentleman and I asked him some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=99.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within five minutes, you just feel better because he just educates you with his knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=105.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked him if he can come out and spend a Friday night to come out and speak and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=111.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: give his opinion and what, you know, his perspective as an educational leader, someone that ran our school system for many, many years, still works at the state level, high level at the state, and he's gonna share some of his knowledge, and then we'll fill in some gaps that people had that had some questions, and we can help educate everybody so they understand what this means on November 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=134.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, I'd like to introduce my friend Roy Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=19.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=28.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=40.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that reads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=43.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That exclusion on fire station shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=72.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: incidental to related there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=78.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=82.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, I thought you supported the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=85.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=96.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=103.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how they've been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=105.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=109.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=122.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're willing to stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=126.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=132.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financially for an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=136.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please do not vote for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=141.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=148.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=155.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=161.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=167.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=188.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=196.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=202.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=207.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=220.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=222.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=225.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=227.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an issue that I put forth years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=230.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=242.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we never saw sidewalks being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=244.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could never catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=246.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know my colleagues say, see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=249.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=250.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=252.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=254.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I love the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=261.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=270.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=280.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we been resourceful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=283.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=290.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=293.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=301.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=309.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=318.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We showed them that avenue through free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=322.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=325.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They imposed a rule to shut me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=329.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=332.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=337.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that school kid member said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=339.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=345.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=348.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=351.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=362.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take the $5 million out of free cash,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=366.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=378.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=391.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like the drama behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=394.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question eight's intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=396.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=397.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=399.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed, fix the school schedule at the level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=420.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't that sound expensive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=422.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=423.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe what it is, Roy, you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=435.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're asking for, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=440.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=446.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, what we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=449.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is nothing close to $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=452.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=453.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=456.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the trend here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=459.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six, we heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=460.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seven and eight, education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=463.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand every single community that has fought for an override in their communities has used what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=471.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the children, and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=474.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=478.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I asked my colleagues, and we've heard people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=493.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were there, and you still have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=498.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=501.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=506.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share it with your friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=512.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=519.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want it, never.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=521.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=525.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=527.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=531.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=534.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=537.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=545.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't divide the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=548.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what has happened now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=550.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're dividing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=552.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=553.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=556.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=565.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=569.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=579.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=582.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for those who don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=586.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick step-by-step so you understand it's never quick with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=591.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=596.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caviello was there, Council President Beas was there, and we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=610.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's too dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=612.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we were all for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=616.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Carviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're gonna vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=630.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=631.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What agreement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=634.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know what agreement it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=635.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Carviello and Councilor Knight didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=640.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=644.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A financial task force was created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=649.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A school kid member, two city counselors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=657.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five people with no background in financial battles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=664.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=666.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=672.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=673.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force is meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=675.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=676.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=677.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=679.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're told we're going to get in a meeting before we do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=684.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=688.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have our city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=691.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was the week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart red<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=700.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=708.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means devastation for the school department and our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=714.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=716.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=723.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use our free cash, let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=729.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=735.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=738.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=739.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Scott Pelley shut down, can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=746.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is how we're getting messages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=748.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=752.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was what they came out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=754.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=756.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=757.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who was involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=758.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=761.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=765.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=767.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=769.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all on tape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=774.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=785.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=789.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=802.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but our council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=819.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done, you can't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=820.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=828.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=830.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess what that, that's free, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=834.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=841.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't wanna talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=842.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=844.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move on to the next meeting and I said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=846.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=850.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can I do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=851.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=852.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=859.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=863.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we get to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=866.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our leadership team does the same exact thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=869.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Suspends the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=871.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imposed, says they cannot impose rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=874.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then invoke section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=879.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council leadership says, no, you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=884.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Against the rule, against the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=888.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what was gonna be said is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=893.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=897.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Curtatone was at a crossroads with his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=905.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Big cuts looming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=907.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=920.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had the Sloans from Century Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=925.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had his financial team present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=928.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=932.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=938.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, how do we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=942.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=945.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=948.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two, how do we fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=951.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how does this never happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=955.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we were taught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=958.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=961.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=963.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=965.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to increase those fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=967.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=973.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=974.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Need taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=976.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=978.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=980.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we figure that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=982.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=988.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=989.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Developers pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=992.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=998.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we bring Somerville out of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1001.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1006.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1012.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1016.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1017.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is, that was an open process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1021.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1027.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1035.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1038.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1050.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1056.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1059.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1061.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1070.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1075.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1077.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1081.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1083.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1087.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scott Kelly shouldn't be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1091.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1092.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't give a shit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1098.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to fight for what I think is right so every citizen is heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1102.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this, or I wouldn't do this, or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1110.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were three former counselors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Alicia Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1134.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1136.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1139.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1141.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Senior citizens are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1145.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1154.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1158.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could swallow that, couldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1160.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was with the process that gets started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1162.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1166.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1168.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1170.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1177.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1180.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this meeting tonight is so important, this fundraiser's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1184.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1188.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The restaurants that donated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1190.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's always donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1197.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1201.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1209.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess where that money's coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1212.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1214.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1219.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1225.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has $8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1231.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, God, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1234.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1241.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1255.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bullshit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1258.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money, but some of the people I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1269.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1272.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Mrs. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1274.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, George, help me understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1277.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1281.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So $48,000, I believe she said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1283.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I tell people $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1286.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now my house is worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1290.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My husband died 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1292.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a seamstress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1294.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My social security doesn't cover my taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1298.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So should I move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1300.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some people want them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1302.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1306.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1311.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1318.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1320.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1326.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Devastating for a resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1329.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not candy coating anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1332.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not hiding anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1333.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything you see has been public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1337.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1343.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see the information how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1346.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1348.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1350.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, it's only this much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1353.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1356.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because understand this, and I'll end with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1360.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1363.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1365.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1368.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a registry fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1370.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we talked about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1376.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it stops there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1377.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1379.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1385.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An additional $400 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1389.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, he's a young man, works very hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1392.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully, he can recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1395.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1406.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Kelly, what are we hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1407.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2025, you're gonna get the sales data for 2023, because the peak of the real estate market will pass your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1419.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1421.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have we heard any of that in their homework?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1424.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1426.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's only $400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1428.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's go a step further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1432.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A minimum $200 million renovated high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1437.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who fits that bill?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1439.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1441.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1443.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1444.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take it down to one new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1446.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looking at $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1449.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You people don't understand what that number equates to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1454.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1456.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary and it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1460.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1465.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group never wanted to say no to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1469.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1476.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1488.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1494.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't build something just to check a box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1498.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1501.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1503.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if they're saying it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1506.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've spelt it out for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1509.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very simple process right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1514.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fix the budget with $5 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1518.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1521.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1526.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something we haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1527.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I lying, Ricky?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1531.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many 40B jobs did we lose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1533.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1538.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1539.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tax revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1541.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done the homework on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1542.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $16 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1544.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these aren't lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1546.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are true numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1547.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, you wish you had a platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1562.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've been shut up way too easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1565.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in this forum, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1566.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're my voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1567.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're helping us spread the message now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1570.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1572.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1576.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1580.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have captains that are going to be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1586.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1591.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1598.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1610.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1613.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If a school kid member knocks on your door, it's a shame on you beyond that you have the information right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1620.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: beyond that you know the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1626.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1636.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's going to hurt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1645.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1652.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1655.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect, and we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1663.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1670.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They pay $2,400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pretty cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1676.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1677.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He will not raise that rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1680.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1689.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be passed down to the tenants, and renters are going to go through the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1696.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1700.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did I miss anything, Rick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1701.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1702.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1703.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick's going to tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1705.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, again, I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1707.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got great people working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1709.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for the energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1712.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1716.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Steve's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1717.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1723.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1730.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And show your neighbors and just give us a call, just so people know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1735.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1737.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you vote for an override and we give the mayor $6 million, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1753.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1758.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so again, there's a reason why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1763.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $9 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1768.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1770.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that want to know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1784.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1790.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1792.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1798.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring them out, have them know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1801.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1807.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Formell Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1814.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1818.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1820.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1828.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1841.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you all for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1843.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have a safe ride home and we'll talk to you soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=124.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=253.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=255.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=256.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there anybody from the administration available to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=262.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff or someone else from the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=276.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=277.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one question that I was informed by another city department that they were told that they needed to stop their negotiations because of fear of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=292.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the outcome of the override so they didn't want to commit, I believe, to move forward with any issues with funding moving forward until they know what happens in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=306.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm a little curious if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=310.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we should look at, I know there are some issues that we see that are on here now that I wouldn't object to because I know it's time sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=322.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's something that's really needed, I think we should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=325.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if there are concerns with the override vote and funding moving forward, that they're holding off negotiations, then I think it's something we need to talk about, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=340.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1384.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, Mr President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1386.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr Randazzo again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1387.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1389.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh, you are your, um, history and saving money for our community is second to none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1397.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that everyone should realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1400.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my question is, along with this, I've I've gotten many phone calls from the business district, and I know what some of the changes in parking in Medford Square that the discussion has been that there's going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1414.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the parking for the business community, um, on, um, on Salem Street next to that parking lot next to the I believe it's a national grid building their substation building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1428.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the concerns that the businesses has that there is no lighting in that lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1434.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that been discussed by any chance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1436.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we are office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1476.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1624.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1627.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A question on that topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1632.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the elevator still currently out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1654.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I bring this up because last night we had a very important meeting and I think everybody unanimously decided that having a community meeting with our senior citizens that we're having some confusion on what the debt exclusion and the override questions were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1672.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I get had a few phone calls today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1675.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh from uh representing people that are representing that uh our senior citizens and they were very concerned that uh will the elevators be functioning on october 15th and if not i think we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1690.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: seriously consider moving that committee to the whole meeting to a location where senior citizens can attend that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1699.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it defeats the purpose of what we agreed on yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1703.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have people that can't climb stairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1706.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the 15th something that can work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1740.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we can, if we just have the clerk, if we can, as soon as Mr. Riggi gets us an update, if we can update the council with that, that'd be greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1751.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1892.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Forgive me, that's a late hand Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1990.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1993.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's not the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1997.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was, uh, was talking to someone from the negotiating team from our method police department and they were told during negotiations, I believe that negotiations will be delayed, um, for the fact that the override, um, might be in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2013.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So because of that fact that we need to, um, hold off until we get more understanding or, or see what the vote would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2022.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2025.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in November to move forward with their negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2028.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, the second part of that question is that if that is an issue, um, I'm under the impression that, uh, there's a negotiating line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2039.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if if that's not the case, could you educate me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2043.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there is a case that that it is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2047.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if you can let us know what we are with that as well because in my in my capacity when there's negotiations there's understanding that most municipalities have a negotiated line item that has funding already set aside and if we're holding that out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2068.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because of fear that the override will not move forward and needing that funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2075.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be construed of maybe as a fair tactic if the administration is moving in a for yes vote or it then leaves me a little befuddled if we don't have a line item when we negotiate with our union members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2092.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2144.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2147.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, just with that, though, I just, I think it is a direct correlation of what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2153.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2154.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that is, and we do find that until until we get to our next regular meeting, where we will vote on these, these initiatives, I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2164.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding that if we're looking at, and this is the case, if you do find research and they do come back and says, no, we did mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2175.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that's the case, then it's relevant for tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2181.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that if we do have questions about our financial question marks after the override and where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2191.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're talking we're we're discussing this with a negotiating team then i think that everything has to be on the table when the mayor presents any sort of funding for anything right now um like i said there are things that are presented today that when it comes to a vote i i don't think i can hesitate because i think it's needed but there are some other things that we can look at and say hey i would like i would motion to sever and then look at the different options because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2218.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh the need of funding if that's the case moving forward so i think there's a direct correlation of what i was told and what is on the agenda tonight so thank you mr president and thank you chief of staff nazarian thank you and thank you for being here councillor lemming um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2267.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: yeah i apologize i just want to make sure if it's if i'm confusing councillor uh lemming i can clarify if he wants um the confusion is if there is an issue that's dealing with our city financial concerns and and one group or one situation is being um frozen for uh the the fear of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2291.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: lack of funding later on in November, then this would be a concern moving any money doctor to the next level, considering if there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2305.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some fear and I appreciate the chief of staff looking into it and hoping it's just a rumor, but I got it from a credible source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2314.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's actually part of the negotiating team that said that that did happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2318.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to see maybe, maybe there's some misunderstanding there and get some corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2323.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you're confused with that, I can clear it up if you have any questions for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2397.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2401.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I understand that we have, we have, we, we can, we can respect, excuse me, we can, we can agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2411.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think it's important that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2415.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if it does come to a climate when we need to petition to move funding around from different accounts, there are mechanisms that we could do that depending on what accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2426.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would say everything would be open until we understand the true financial picture on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2433.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2646.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you have, I just got a text message, Mr. Clerk, that maybe I'm out of line, but there's people trying to get on the Zoom that had questions with that response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2657.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like I said, I will move this forward and with a yes vote until we get more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2665.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2667.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2668.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, oh yeah, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2673.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no, it's Harold McGilvrey, the negotiating from the police department wanted to get on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2680.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2681.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it would be yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2741.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. Clerk, did you call my name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2745.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, I'd say no, I wanna hear more of what Council President is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2751.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't worry about his percentages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=262.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before we go on, can I just address my original question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=268.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=271.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pete, there are questions, um, that I know that, um, there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to, to, uh, meetings minutes and how long we could speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=283.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there are follow up questions, and if there's one question, I believe council bears explain the process that we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=290.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, as council president, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=298.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=306.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope we would do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=308.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other question that Councilor Behrs did read, did speak about is that we all asked for information to be sent out to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=318.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's response, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=322.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or given, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=337.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sending this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=350.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=358.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=365.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=374.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got that, that response was today, correct, Council Beers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=376.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was 10 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=392.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=398.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=404.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Adam, did you forward this to everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=843.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the word transparent gets thrown around, Ted, and I hate for you to get dragged into this, but you weren't part of any financial task force for the override, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=859.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Normally, when communities put this into place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=863.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm told from different communities, different assessors, finance directors, that they usually line this up prior to any budget meetings, so we can help our most vulnerable people in our community understand what any impact it would make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=878.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this calculation that you're doing for us, and thank you so much for doing it, because I know there were so many questions with the calculations that have been public on the side that you had nothing to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=888.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it came out of a state website, but it didn't truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=894.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: calculate the newer assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=896.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's correct, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this and now we're doing it on the 11th hour, the question was normally in your experience, other professionals in your field, this is done usually during budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=913.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can prepare our residents that if there was an increase of 373 median price,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=922.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=923.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it sounds minimal to some people because it's only, that's all we keep hearing, it's only, but is it odd that we're doing this so late?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=945.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=947.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=950.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1135.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1136.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With just a couple more questions, I know that you mentioned that this doesn't have any impact on question six, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1143.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not in fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1145.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's not enough time to put everything in, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1148.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know the actual numbers, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1155.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but we still don't know how much for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1158.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an open-ended, as it said in the question, there's nothing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1169.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1170.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I realize the exemptions are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1173.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I know that there are options when you do this ahead of time is to really prepare your seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1179.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the exemptions sound good, but when you read them and you talk to actual people, there are a lot of senior citizens that really don't fit in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1187.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are no other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1190.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know the buzzwords easy to say, we do have exemptions, but when you put it apples to apples and you sit with the senior citizen and you go through their situation, I'm sure you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1200.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mrs. Jones bought her house with her husband 55 years ago for 50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1204.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the house is appraised at a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1208.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it really doesn't help what we're offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1211.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a funny number and there could be something done more if we had time for an exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1218.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1219.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if we had time, this is something we could petition to see if we can really truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1224.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1226.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that must be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1227.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the, the last piece to this, I think that when they look at this and because one question I have Ted is that a lot of people have asked, not just seniors, um, that the, this is like a one time tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1240.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1241.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see that 4% above your two and a half percent increase, that's going to be compounded year after year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1249.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that's going to go away like debt exclusion, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1257.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so that'll grow forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1259.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the other piece that people have to understand too, and it's a tough office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1264.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, when you hear the misconceptions, I just need your input to educate our residents and understanding that, again, I believe the mayor said her house is only $13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1275.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some others here said their house is $40 a month or whatever, and we can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1281.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That might be the first year, but again, we were told, I think someone from your office emailed us and said that we'll be reassessing again in 2025 for 2026 using the data for 2023, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1310.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1311.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1312.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for helping with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1314.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, when this tax goes in, it's now assessed again, the homes will be assessed again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1323.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but we're seeing that most assessments, because I could tell you, I'm dealing with my own family members that are looking at a $400 increase per month for his new assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1336.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1337.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that what people also have to understand is that it's not just the home tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1342.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've seen their cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1347.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motor vehicle excise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1348.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vehicle excise tax is going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1350.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see the CPA tax because your homes are going to be assessed higher now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1354.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now the CPA tax will also be taxed higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1357.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see that a little bit higher, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1360.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's yeah, that's generally correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1366.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1367.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you're seeing is, it's not just it's not just an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1374.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1375.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's compounded year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1377.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a tax that increases in the CPA as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1380.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the excise tax that increases as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1383.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so much more than just 13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1385.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my point I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1387.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's easy to look at a site that wasn't put forth by our office because we know that although it's correct, the numbers that my colleagues did put out there on a page, it does give the numbers that are true and factual, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1403.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't include the assessments that residents had, and I'll use my brother's example, because his house was appraised at, on the calculations, at $800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1413.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His house is now appraised at $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1415.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why we're seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1417.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1419.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is family-owned homes that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1422.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we passed on to generation to generation, just like most people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1426.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1427.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I'm monopolizing the time because I think it's important, because these are the questions the people that are sitting in this in this room right now and their friends have contacted me and said, we're very confused, Mr. Scappelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1438.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because even something simple as, Mr. Scott Pelley, why are we fighting for $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1445.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, no, no, this has nothing to do with the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1447.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1448.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people understanding that, well, this is a fight between schools and kids and senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1455.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1456.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just want to make sure all the information's out so every resident understands the impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1462.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that, and we could talk about solutions as we go, because there are solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1466.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were solutions back in April, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1593.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the microphone on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1597.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Andrew, is the mic, turn the mic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2045.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me start off by first saying that unfortunately this administration has divided this community for the children in the schools and the seniors or the homeowners or renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2057.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say shame on this administration, shame on this council, shame on the financial task force, because the bottom line is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2065.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group knew that we were heading in some tough waters back in June 20th of 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2072.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you could see that in a city council budget meeting when council beers met with the mayor behind closed doors to set up some sort of deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2081.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't know what that deal was, but they created a financial task force and that financial task force put together a plan of an override without anybody's knowledge, anybody's input or any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2094.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or any community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2097.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no issues with our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2101.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a fair tactic and fair tactic only for the fact that we should remember this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2107.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Back in April, back in May, back in June, when the city had $25 million in free cash, it was my responsibility to bring forth that we take that $5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2119.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: levy that budget, make sure there were no cuts, understand the process, and then move forward to see if we truly need an override, which I never said that should never be an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2130.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to hear parents and teachers and friends and family say, George, explain this to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2138.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes knew that this was gonna be a devastating situation, but it could have been solved and still could be solved with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2147.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have plenty of free cash in the system not to turn the city upside down or divide the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2153.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, remember, I'll leave you with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2156.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're asking for in the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2159.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this override doesn't mean you'll get exactly what you think you're gonna get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2165.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all these cuts were made to set up this override as a fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2170.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli is not against the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2173.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just hope that people understand that this could be soft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2178.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2530.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2532.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I heard some similar situations with, I know what the assessor came up and gave us medium price homes, but we're seeing real people have told me that this is what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2544.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing the increase close to $60,000, most homes that you're seeing an increase at a higher percentage rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2551.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, on top of all of what we talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2554.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with this, so it's not the $13 a month, the $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2557.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the pieces that this gentleman just said is the understanding that I never thought that our home insurance now will now increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2568.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this isn't them against us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2572.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is understanding that we have viable options right now to fix this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2579.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with free cash and then work together to see how we can have an open process to really include all the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, that no one is hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2590.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2917.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2918.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I think my council is not understanding the free cash should be used now to fix a problem now, which we have, and I appreciate the clarification it's only $3 million accounts accounting and just said to fix the school budget, but the key issue isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2933.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't the process of getting this fixed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2936.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem that we've had, and we could use the pandemic and use the pandemic over and over again, but what neighboring communities are doing during the pandemic with the infrastructure money that was given through ARPA, that wasn't intended for, for the roads and sidewalks that you're asking for right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2951.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2952.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor had to balance our budget through ESSER and ARPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2957.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the easy way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2958.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's like paying your mortgage with a credit card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2961.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2962.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2963.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody hasn't said it, but the difference between why we're here and we're in trouble is because of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2970.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth is what pushes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2973.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our value, our income up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2975.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It gives us more tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2977.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It brings more money so we can do all the things we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2980.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This mayor has done nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2982.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had shovel in the ground in five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2985.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about, I know my council friends have gone out and told people that Massachusetts is the number one, Medford is the number one community new growth in permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2995.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong, I sat with the commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2997.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Permitting their fine, the biggest concerns we're having, look at the process that she lost fighting 40B projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3005.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One project alone was $3 to $5 million in permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3010.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then an additional $7 to $9 million that would have come in as new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3015.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one job that she fought in court, lost and appealed it, and this group had to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3021.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem isn't our tax base, because our assessments are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3025.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're paying more than anybody else in neighboring communities because our assessments are so high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3031.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will share my last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3034.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighbor communities per child, Malden, Arlington, Winchester, between 15 and 17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3042.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford, we pay $22,000 per student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3045.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it a management issue or is it really we don't have enough money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3049.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it because it's public. $22,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3530.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this financial task force was put together without any individual involved in that comment that a young lady put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3542.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3544.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3546.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't planned to educate our seniors, educate our residents, educate our renters, educate our landlords, so they could prepare themselves for what's being asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3557.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: within a vote that was presented, a discussion was presented on a Thursday, voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3564.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not one community meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3565.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, I will share this with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3569.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a FOIA request put out by a resident that asked a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3575.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They asked for all of the information, minutes for the meetings, any information, letters, any emails, any text messages, with this financial task force, with any building or any entity within the city to figure out if this is needed or how it will be used and how it can work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3593.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 150 pages later, all the information that was in that FOIA request were information about when we can meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3600.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing that's solid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3602.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would also share with these parents that are so concerned about what's happening, we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3608.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: saw the information back from the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3612.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school department communications director answered by saying, thank you for the FOIA request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3617.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We apologize for the tardy response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3620.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after investigating, there was no school department employee or member of the school department involved in any financial task force<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3630.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dealing with these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3631.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what again, what we're saying is we don't know if an override is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3636.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know one thing, we know we could fix this issue right now with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3641.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our students and teachers and families are fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3644.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we go back to the drawing board as a community together to see what we really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3650.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the mayor isn't gonna put new growth out there, she's not gonna work to bring in creatively, bring in funding for the city, then maybe we can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4026.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Financial director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4203.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, let me help you, Mr. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4206.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force was a farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4208.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a lack of transparency throughout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4211.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you speak on, I speak to this in where I worked in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4216.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we met in a possible override in a neighboring community, we talked about three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4221.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was how do we get here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4223.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we do to fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4224.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how does this happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4226.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those people brought in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4228.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mines from Tufts, Harvard, MIT, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4233.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They brought in their financial team, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4237.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had their assessor set the rate so people can understand, assessor was never involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4241.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look at how this was done, this was done in a bubble, this was presented on a Thursday, and then voted for in the budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4249.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look at the budget meetings, when I brought up the way to fix it, which is free cash, and I'll disagree with my fellow counselor, because she's wrong 1,000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4261.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash for divisional local services, it's not recommended, but not against the law to use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4269.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 3 to 5% annual budget, FY24 method generated $9 million to add to a $25 million estimate, which means the city had around 16% of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4281.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, the solution was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4284.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have this financial task force present this to the community, because that's what I asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4289.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked my colleagues, when are we going to present what the findings were?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4293.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were no findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4294.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just given, we're going to do an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4296.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People came up, shared, the mayor was happy, and it was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4299.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4302.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was no one involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4304.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble to scare people, to come out and say, the schools, the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4310.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4311.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said this in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said it in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it today again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4314.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need an override, but if we do it right, with open and transparent government, we could do something great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4321.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now remember, with one override in every other community, there's two, three to follow, and don't forget, this council's gonna ask for a 200 to $400 million debt exclusion from New High School, which we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4332.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4334.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't be confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4336.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not telling you the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4337.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4339.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4854.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4855.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people should understand the mayor came out just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4858.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had 34 million, 34.5 million as of July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4863.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor, just so you know, what free cash is, it's your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4866.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we say we're going to fund 50 teachers and we don't pay those 50 teachers because they don't hire them, that money goes into free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4875.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our money, that's your tax money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4877.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then it could be used for what it needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4879.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's truly mismanagement of funds from our leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4884.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's taking what we sign off on our budget and not use correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4889.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we have right now, I believe I've said this, Councilor Lemming said it over and over again, I'm not saying use free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4897.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a deficit right now, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4900.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we can correct right now and not put the schools and kids and teachers in fear and say let's level fund that budget using one time free cash one time and then look into what options we have later but let's listen to the mayor what she said 34.5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4916.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now she knows the override's gonna be a fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4918.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What does she do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4919.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom, she starts putting all these different monies in different accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4923.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from her words exactly in her video the other day, we have 18.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4928.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With that said, we can still take funding to level the school budget and still have 14, $15 million, which still leaves enough in there that would appease any bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4940.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, let's not get scared because that's a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4944.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see the bond rating so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4946.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, when we look at this situation, council, different communities, free cash, Arlington is 18 million, Framingham 14 million, bigger budget, Quincy 1.2 million, bigger budget, Andover 14 million, Newton, these communities are bigger than ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4964.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have this budget, they function with lower funding and free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4971.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand this, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4972.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can do this one-time cost to save the fare from our schools, take care of our seniors, our renters, our homeowners, so we can stop the fare in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4982.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, vote no on these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4987.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4988.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5219.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's 18.5 left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5226.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5438.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. Giglio, these are all scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5443.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, the financial task force didn't have the FOIA requests that shows that there were no documentations, no minutes, no information given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5453.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard the assessor, we know all the major parties, the school department, the assessor, the finance director, weren't involved in these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5462.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, it's not a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5464.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just said it, you heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5466.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Put 30 seconds back on for interrupting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5468.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the understanding that the sky is falling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5474.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of these projects that we need to fix, we need to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5477.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In normal communities, what we do is we bond these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5481.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we look at situations that we talked about earlier, when it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5486.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're trying, what we're seeing here right now, Mr. Joyo, it's the underfunding of local revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5496.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One second, I'll just, it's the focus of what we're seeing that our community has done for years here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5502.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's show lower meals tax and hotel tax and excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5507.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then when it comes higher, you can put that and use it for whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5511.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let that be known, the understanding what you're asking for, there are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5515.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem we hear right now, why the city's divided, why our seniors are scared, why our landlords are scared, why our homeowners and renters are afraid right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5523.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why our students and parents and teachers are afraid is because this group did something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5529.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They put it out there without any true information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5531.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5533.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't been educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5534.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why there's so much fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5536.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The firefighters aren't supporting a $30 million fire station, because again, there was no transparency there when it came to the final decision that had to be made for 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5544.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've decided to go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5546.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They decided to go public to say, let's not hurt our taxpayers with whatever, how many it's going to be, because we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5553.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be a $50 million fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5555.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the design was never put forth to the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5559.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you say totality, six, seven, and eight, we haven't been involved, Mr. Gileo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5564.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5565.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5566.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this group did it in the financial task force that presented it on a Thursday, voted on it on a Tuesday, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5574.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We find $9 million in free cash after that, that the man knew was certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5583.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, can I say one more thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5685.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wouldn't know that because it's literally in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6037.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the fair tactics, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6038.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6041.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's Councilor Lemming said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6044.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we haven't done it, so let's do it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6047.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just because we haven't done it, let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6049.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the roads, now we hear the schools were built bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6054.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's all fair, this is all fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6056.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here's the thing, we're not saying that, let's not look at this properly and do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6064.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6065.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6067.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it so privately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6068.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it where it's gonna hurt so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6072.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the finger-pointing between teachers and finger-pointing between seniors and kids, and it's a shame what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6082.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can correct this right now with the free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6085.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they say, the truth of the matter is we have free cash to make sure that seven and eight are correctable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6092.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know question six is correctable by listening to our firefighters, who will tell you straightforward that the mayor's not telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6102.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they're building there is insufficient, and it's going to put us 30 years behind in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6108.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please understand this, Mr. Gervino, when you say all this information and how it gets out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6114.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though councils want to say we did, we haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6117.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our seniors for what's going to happen on January 1st of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6122.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once the new assessment, once the new tax bills come out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6126.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared up our, our, our landlords to how they're going to handle single parent, uh, renters in their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6132.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our renters when increase goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6135.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6136.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Somebody called me when I put a post out about a woman that called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6140.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She has two children, and the landlord said, I'm not going to hit you with the assessment raise, but I'm going to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6147.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got to tell you, I'm going to have to raise your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6151.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And someone asked me, well, are you going to support rent control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6154.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, there's another wrong that doesn't make a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6157.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, there's a system in place with this group that's telling you what you should do out of fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6163.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, again, we have the funds to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6167.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they're saying, it's absolutely above board to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6172.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand it was done with mismanagement throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6177.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6514.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6524.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6527.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6528.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6529.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And by law, you're supposed to take the letter of what the questions are and use those funding as closely as you can to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6538.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions as they're read are very vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6542.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it really doesn't mean it's gonna go directly to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6546.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be portions of that or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6548.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'll bring us back to the budget meeting when school committee member Jenny Graham was asked a question, if we were given $5 million, would everybody go back to those positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6559.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6561.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next evening, the school's financial director and the school superintendent, when I asked that question from the evening before, she said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6571.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money would go back into their fund and they would distribute it to what they think is best for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6577.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6580.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6581.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about all these different cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6583.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't filled, I believe now 29 teachers in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6589.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's funding we haven't, we paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6591.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have so many dire issues, so many, the fiscal crisis we've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6597.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same breath, we're asking to bring in shiny new programs that are new, that are costing the school department $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6606.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about a city council that during this financial crisis talked about, did what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6612.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We found $9 million of free cash when they looked at the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6616.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6617.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They voted themselves a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6619.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the SIKU committee now goes from $10,000 to $12,000 up to $22,000, $24,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6626.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor gets an increase three times, three different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6630.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore all of you who are open-minded thinkers, are you sure we're in a fiscal crisis or are we in a problem with this fiscal mismanagement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6726.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6951.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Councilor Bielsa, in question six, I think we have a firefighters union here that have been involved in the negotiation because there is no limit on question six, truly is no limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6962.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6964.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's wide open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that if we can maybe have a fire fighters that have been working on this, just to give us an idea of what the process was, the beginning, what we were looking at for a number and how, how much it's dropped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6978.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can understand truly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6984.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6985.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm sorry, hopefully the firefighters can have an opportunity to express why they want to vote no on this debt exclusion because I think what you asked, there is such fluctuation and what's true, what they needed and what was agreed upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7003.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before the mayor became very angry with the firefighters and then started cutting and cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7008.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we're left with an inferior product that our firemen and women, firefighter men and women said over and over again, that please do not hurt the residents of this community with an inferior station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7020.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7021.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wait, maybe down the line, we could rethink this and refocus on what we could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7025.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for now, we're saying, let's not hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have teachers that are saying, let's not hurt our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7031.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have firefighters saying, let's not hurt the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7034.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions you're asking should have been out there for you, Joan, months and months ago, so you could truly understand the impact that you're going to feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7043.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is where we talk about the lack of transparency and why this should be taken off the table and people should vote no, because the bottom line is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7053.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fear of children, that should be fixed with the $3 million from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7057.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor said it, we have 18.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7059.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could still take 3 million out and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7061.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll still have enough to keep our bond rating up and look to bond other projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7066.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or maybe we sit together again as a true financial working group, a task force, and say, how do we do this together as a community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7074.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not gonna look later because there's no guarantees that there won't be another override next year, I promise you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7080.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because every other community that's gone that way have asked for two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7626.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7629.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't this a total microcosm of what we're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7633.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what 678 is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7635.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so much confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7638.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, we have to understand the feasibility study that was done is what gets us the funding for through procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7645.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we know the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7647.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When my fellow council said that this is a city building and firefighters, I don't know what the comment was, that is so irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7654.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To understand that this fire department's gonna stand up and say, no, we don't want a new headquarters because it's insufficient and it will hurt our community funding-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7665.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we say the needs of the community, we mean proper safe staffing and department and ability to add technical rescue specialist services to our emergency response, which will bring better services to the citizens in every call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7678.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's wrong what they're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7679.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're asking for a fire stations adequate to help our community grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7685.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The proposed design does not adequately address the health and safety issues of the fire service regarding cancer exposure mitigations, the privacy concerns which have never been addressed properly by our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7697.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Adults deserve privacy regardless of the gender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7700.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't an issue which is female and men.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7703.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you understand the design that was presented has firefighters after a fire showering downstairs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7709.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: walking upstairs in a towel or a bathrobe, walking down a community hallway to get to their quarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7716.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, their quarters did not consist of a locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7721.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7722.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are issues that I can't even believe that we would entertain this with so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7728.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how six, seven, and eight were all done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7730.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were all done in a bubble that we're supposedly battled over on social media by a leader of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7739.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the former fire chief here, we have the leaders of our fire department that have openly said, we don't want to hurt our citizenry and putting $30 million, let alone $3 into this because we don't know what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8151.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate my fellow counselor being in my mind to understand what my plan was, was to get the superintendent to say something she didn't wanna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8162.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate the resident who put all of the meetings out on social media because you could say whatever you want about George Scott Pelley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8174.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say that he's a liar, but when there are video and documentations with it, simple question to the superintendent was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8182.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Will this money, will it be made whole like Councilor, School Committee Woman Graham mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8187.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her simple answer was no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8189.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't trying to have her say anything any different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8191.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, what we're seeing in the school system after that vote, there were many teachers and many programs that were dismissed and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8200.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had the band leader who left right away because there were promised things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8204.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, we had to believe a $200,000 line put in place for City Year, which is a great program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8210.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great program, but when you have so many fiscal crises in the city, why are we funding something that's just a shiny nickel right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8217.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues with this, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8220.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore you just to listen to the common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8224.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen to the understanding that you can use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8227.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former teacher, and a parent of public school kids, and a coach, I understand, I lived it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8235.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8237.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I also understand and how to move forward without hurting our whole community or without dividing our whole community, because this is what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8247.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These override questions are hurting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8250.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have the information that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8253.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not spelled out correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8255.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't truly know, although like Councilor Kelly had said, yeah, it goes to the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8260.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where that money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8263.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have teachers positions open with money in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8265.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, there's a lot of money that hasn't been used to date that we can still use, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8537.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we went over this again, just to reiterate to people that are new to the room, $37, that's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8544.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coming from people that truly don't understand the impact, because a lot of people here, imagine just $37 a month, what that would do to people sitting in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8552.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine the impact, because that's been overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8555.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8556.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the CPA increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8558.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8560.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8562.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear spins it easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8567.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'm gonna say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8569.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear, we talked about busing now, lead in the water, teacher cuts, roads and sidewalks, because $500,000 is gonna fix road and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8580.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the most important thing I wanna talk about is what's happening in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8584.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you watch what's happening in social media, the teachers union, the MTA, has never ever, as one person that was on the negotiating team and a former member, has never ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8599.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ruled on or endorsed a candidate or a question, because we knew as union members that our impact's not gonna hurt just, it's not gonna help us, but it's gonna hurt other unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8611.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they did the right thing by staying neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8616.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe they believe in it, maybe they don't, but they said, let's be, let's stay neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8620.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And shame on this community that have turned their backs on teachers saying, the comments I've been seeing, like this is the teacher's fault?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8628.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't the teacher's fault, this is the administration's fault to set up this fear tactic and set up this negativity to divide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8636.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8639.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I want everything we can get for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8642.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our students and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8646.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8649.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's options with new growth as we come down the line, but we can correct it right now without hurting renters, landlords, senior citizens, our people that are most vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8659.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use that free cash, make it whole and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8665.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore you, please, think about what you've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8669.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's concrete, common sense information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8672.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9184.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, Councilor, to clarify a little something, I think that what I've heard from residents is the chronic misrepresentation and the lack of true transparency<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9198.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is what causes the community to distrust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9203.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9205.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's truly what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9207.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you hear and see how we got to this point, this is what caused it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9214.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The misinformation, the confusion, the uncertainty for the people that are most vulnerable, our children, our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9226.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the issue that we should be focusing on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9229.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and thinking that an override is the answer, or, ready for this one, $500,000 are gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9237.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9239.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's look at, now I've heard that 20 times tonight, that $500,000 is gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9244.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the big picture of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9246.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW, the mayor is firing DPW workers hand over fist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9252.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have equipment at DPW that we have members that haven't been trained because they don't know how to be trained on new equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9261.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a mayor that's spending so much money on legal fees and legal settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9269.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're using, the mismanagement of funds in this community has hurt us to the point that here we are, that some council is saying, hey, since we haven't done it ever, let's do it, which is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9283.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'd love to see us do this the right way from the schools with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9290.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's go to the table and see what we truly need with a true financial team open to the public that it's shared with everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9299.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9456.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't understand her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9457.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't hear her question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9466.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9467.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9468.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we sat and talked at the meeting in April, May, and June, I came forth with the proposal of a resolution of using free cash of the $25 million that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9483.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was Councilor, when I brought it forth, it was Councilor Lemming that used Rule 21, which froze<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9491.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the future discussions of that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9494.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as it went through and you could see in the videos, as we went through that process, they kept using tactics where we couldn't speak or have open forums before we went to a vote in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9506.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these are issues that when I say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9511.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we need to eliminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9512.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to sit together as a community and say, okay, what do we work with the state and work with our assessor and say, hey, let's understand the impact at an early enough stage so we can be prepared for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9524.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see if we can look at true exemptions that would help our landlords or senior citizens<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9529.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or our most vulnerable community members, then let's look at it and say, what do we really need and make sure that our children in our schools have everything that they're asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9539.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that with that process being open, I don't think we wouldn't be able to deny anything, but the way the process has come out and the way that's been spun saying, Councilor Scott Pelling wants no because he doesn't want that, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9555.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is the way this process has gone about from 2023 in June till today has been a total farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9563.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9564.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9566.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council can say what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9568.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These fair tactics are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9570.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9571.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not making it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9572.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them all say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9574.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's whether it's whether it's streets falling in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9578.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, even the mayor said the other day was sitting on a 200 million dollar time bomb called our water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9584.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9585.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if we did our job with ARPA, that's what that money was made for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9590.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to save your key, sir, because you had no new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9593.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10069.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10070.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10071.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This councilor has not said once that we should use free cash year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10076.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I said right now is eliminate the fear for our senior citizens, our children, our teachers for one time to level fund this and look at other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know where this keeps coming back and forth and understand an override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10094.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was said by another financial director in another community, he said to me, George, remember, using an override to do what you're trying to do in Medford, it's like using your credit card to pay for your mortgage or pay for your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10105.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10107.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a right way to go through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10109.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different situations that we talk about and we said, okay, you know, Medford has drastically underfunded so many processes when you look at our receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10122.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10123.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see that our circuit breaker has increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10128.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen that we use the Fair Amendment Act for Chapter 70, our increase of $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10136.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a lot that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10138.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of money in the city that we're not using correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10144.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10145.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, just to have the fact that you have $9 million of free cash at the end of the year, your budget season, to get certified, that just speaks volumes of mismanagement of fiscal funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10159.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, when you sit there and you set that budget, that budget is set, let's say 100 million, and then you only spend 90 million, that means you didn't do something right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10173.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means you didn't use that money appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10176.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the city's taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10180.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I say free cash, of course it's not free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10183.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's our money that we've already paid the year before to balance our budget, to make our city run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10226.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simon, thank you for coming up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10229.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so impressed with you coming to this podium, because there are so many scaredy cat adults, but you have the guts to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10235.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you for that, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10237.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have family members that might be your teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10241.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have children that went through the schools just like you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10245.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's scary right now, because you're listening to grownups talk about, we're gonna cut positions, we're gonna hurt teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10252.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the intent, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10254.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a solution that's easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10257.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use money that the city has saved, that can fix it right now, instead of going to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10263.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that Mr. Scott Pelley asked for years, months and months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10267.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you come to this point, my friend, you have to understand, we wanna make sure that every single one of your teachers are back next year, because you know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10276.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10278.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10950.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10952.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To your point, Mr. Rodriguez, I think that this is why question eight, again, this is why these questions are so vague, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10959.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That people are confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10960.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because the determination of this $4 million is so we can align the vocational school building with the high school building so we can increase the day, so we can provide programming for both levels, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10974.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10977.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10978.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10980.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where is the money gonna go when it's not even entertained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10986.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10988.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question that's $4 million, the state expert and former superintendent of Medford, Roy Belson, stated, if during negotiations, that's what we're looking for is to line those bells, then it's negotiations for the high school and vocational school teachers to increase their rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11013.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Realistically, you're looking at $600,000 when you're looking to do that group, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11018.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $4 million for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11021.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we've said, more arts programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11024.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have art programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11026.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue is aligning the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11028.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In programming, we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11029.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just gotta line the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11032.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's so wide open to say $4 million to do arts and to align this process with the vocational school and the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11042.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is so vague, how can we even entertain voting on it when we know the ramifications to the rest of the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11051.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11055.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hear what was being said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11057.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open-ended questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11059.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that people don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11063.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have FOIA requests that show that there was no proper discussions with school department members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11069.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the school department isn't part of this financial task force for an override, and then a question like question eight comes up, it's so vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11077.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11078.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure that we need an override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11184.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where does it say that though?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11185.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's eloquent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11187.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You would have to look at it if it was presented that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11190.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11191.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11192.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11737.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11741.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11743.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I missed most of the question, Bill, but again, like we're saying, we're hearing a systemic issue that's been happening for years, but the way the process, and I'll say again, the way the process has come forth, the way the process has come full circle right now, it's putting so many people, so many residents in flux and fear, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11765.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11767.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the way that we've moved forward, that this group has moved forward to present an out, that really isn't an out like they've said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11776.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not gonna really help, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11779.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where the money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11780.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things are still questioned for each question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11783.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not certainties, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11786.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already heard from everybody that hasn't been part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11790.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, why continue this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11794.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why keep moving forward and understanding that we're hurting real people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11797.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting real residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11800.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I said, I like, again, I'm talking about the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11803.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about the seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11804.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11805.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11807.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting a lot of people right now for something that quote unquote is so minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11814.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the truth of the matter is, this is so minimal and such cause such divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11819.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're now seeing is, are we truly gonna look at the next question when we really need it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11825.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or are we gonna look at it with caution and saying, I'm definitely gonna stand against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11833.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll use a $200 million, $400 million high school down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11838.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine if that process was done, how it would destroy homeowners right now, senior citizens, people on fixed incomes, it would destroy us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11847.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this process has to be done in a better way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11849.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It shouldn't be done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11852.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11926.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think if I can, Mr. President, I think when we've heard parents of the fear, right, that we're going to cut, I believe one school can remember saying it was 55 to 65 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11938.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it was now 35 and the pain, the fear is going to be spread all over, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11945.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's going to feel the pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11947.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the comment that's gone out publicly by that school can remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11950.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11951.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what you're saying to this is saying that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11955.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we gonna cut, a teacher's gonna be cut in January, January 2025, if the override fails in November?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11963.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a question, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11964.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11966.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know because in these questions, these override questions, you didn't say to cover the cost of 55 to 65 teachers that will be cut, not a question seven or question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11977.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11979.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that again leads to another example of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11985.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure we know what we're voting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11987.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are we sure we need to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11991.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And was this transparent enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12003.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12004.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, everyone, where's Simon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12007.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your teachers aren't going to be cut this year, because that's the word going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12011.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word was at these meetings now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They will not be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be no cuts until next fiscal year, next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12017.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But next fiscal year, we'll have more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12018.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12019.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12020.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll give us time, because we had an opportunity, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12023.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an opportunity back in 2023, when we realized that we were using ARPA and ESSER funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12031.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to balance a budget of operations which you shouldn't that we know that but this council voted on a backroom deal that that's what happened and then they've moved forward with this financial task force so here we are right now that was only 1.7 right only 1.7 so all right so this is where we are right now i'd like to not go back and forth guys oh i apologize so this is thank you i apologize thank you um go to vice president collins two minutes thank you and guess on i realize i may have misunderstood your question um with what fiscal year you were talking about but i know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12716.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12717.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let's start off by the teachers and compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12720.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A good way to make sure they go is scare them with layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12726.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you have an avenue to save them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12729.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with this question, the truth of the matter is, in most communities, it's growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12734.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Growth, growth, growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12736.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth, smart development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12737.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12739.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened in neighboring communities like Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12741.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the pandemic, what happened in Everett, what happened in Malden, you saw new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12747.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard my council colleagues say that it'll take us five to seven years to see that wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12751.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had three 40B projects that not only would bring in valuable funding through permits and fees, and then the new tax base, but also open up an opportunity for what we lack here is affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12768.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this mayor has voided that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12770.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, just one project, and I'll say it over and over again, because we've talked to the owner of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12776.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He put in a place for 40B projects, 400 units at the old gold gym site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12781.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 to $5 million just in permits would have come right to us, right away, $3 to $5 million for one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12787.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you would see an increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12789.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once that's built, you would then have a tax base of more to $6 to $9 million coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12797.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now what you saw is the mayor fight that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12800.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is a 40B project, which you can't fight and win in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12803.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12804.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She takes it to court, they lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12806.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then she brings it back and she appeals it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12810.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we're paying lawyers, we lose the appeal, but at the same time, we now have these developers that have walked away to Medford because now they're in Watertown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12819.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're in other neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12821.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this gentleman just lost $5 million by sitting on a property, hoping he could develop Medford the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12827.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece we have right now, the mayor is, did everybody hear this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12830.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an RFP for five spots in Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12834.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12836.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12837.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is again, lack of transparency and openness in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12840.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13095.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if I can, I think there's more involved here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13101.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's very clear and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13103.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the communities can see that our firemen and women do not want this override or this debt exclusion because it hurts our citizenry because the design and the building that they're looking to build is not adequate for any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13117.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have a firefighter standing in front of us that, so we all understand why we're in fiscal crisis, why we're in fiscal issues, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13127.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Firefighter Masolino wrote a grant for 11 firefighters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13131.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through FEMA, so the FEMA would pay these 11 firefighters for three years, as long as you didn't vary from those 11 firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13142.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, at the end, the only caveat is you have to sustain those 11 firefighters to be at minimal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13150.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, no, we'll only fund five or seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13154.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just by doing that, guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13156.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It voided the 11 firefighters that would have been paid for FEMA for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13162.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council, the mayor had a outside member doing evaluation to come in, and we spent $10,000 to start with this firefighter evaluator to come in and look at the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13177.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have yet to hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13179.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I hear, that person's been gone now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13181.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No report, no nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13183.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we see, the mismanagement of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13186.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not that we don't have, in certain cases, enough funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13190.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's how you manage those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13192.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you for everything you do, and we should not vote support this override, because our firefighters are saying, let's not hurt our residents, especially if it's an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13206.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll stay where we are, even though it's disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13210.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14012.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate the question because I too have a stance on this and it's difficult when your kids are reading posts and saying, hey dad, why are they using you for supporting constituents and residents that feel like they're being not listened to, to racist or a member of KKK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14034.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's pretty sad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14036.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see these situations of division,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14039.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's because people feel they haven't been heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14043.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I welcome you to look at the videos from our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14046.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had viable questions in our meetings, and this is where the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14050.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you try to bring these questions forward and this council actively shut you down, as a member of this community and a city councilor, to be disrespected like that, opened up so many people's eyes to say, is this something that's been, is it needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14067.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's a group of people, my friend, that aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14071.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're afraid that no one's listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14075.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that could be corrected, I've said this a thousand times, I never said I didn't want a debt exclusion, or the side, even the All-Method group saying that they didn't want a debt exclusion, all they're saying is, let's have a more open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14087.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard so many questionable issues tonight, from the firefighters' designs, to question seven and eight, there's so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14094.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the problem right now is you have six councils that really look at something and an issue and they band together, but they leave a whole demographic out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14102.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They can say the fluffy words to say that, well, it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14106.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're saying it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14107.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Words that some people use is divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14109.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is if it's smell, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14114.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and people just watch and see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14116.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want division either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14118.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's too much division in this whole country, in this whole world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14121.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love for us to sit together, but as a councilor, when you're trying to share an opinion for a group of constituents that feel that they're not being listened to, that they feel like they're not being listened to, then you bring that forward, and then they actively shut you down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14137.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They use council rules against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14139.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They suspend council rules so you can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14142.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14144.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14146.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because people didn't feel like they were properly listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14149.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't feel like this financial task force was actually transparent and open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14152.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if they were, and the mayor presented all the facts, maybe we'd be in a different place right now, but we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14160.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we made a lot of mistakes on many sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14989.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that when you left, no one could say this publicly, but we wanna thank you because we know how difficult your job is anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14995.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand becoming a chief is very difficult because you have been thrown into the realm of politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15001.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's sad because I know who you are as a man and I know how much you love being a firefighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15006.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll be honest with you, I was sad to hear that you did step away because Medford is worse as a fire department because you're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15014.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna make sure publicly somebody said that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15016.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Danielle doesn't want to say it, but I've heard it over and over again through public, through social media, our leader of the community, through social media, bashing on you, bashing on other fire chiefs, saying it's all them, that they've been part of the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15032.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I need to know, when you left, were our firefighters involved in that design that we have today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15340.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15341.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15346.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Clarification, thank you with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15347.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also know that from what I've heard, it's 1,000 square feet smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15352.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you want to talk about unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15354.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about doing something correct as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15356.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking about firefighters, that their safety with carcinogens aren't being met, I think in unity, we should all say that we do not support this debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15367.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's inadequate for our men and women in the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15370.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I think we should say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15372.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to start in that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15374.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15375.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Chief, thank you so much for the clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15377.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that our firefighters aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16519.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16521.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So very simply put is, I've been saying this for months now, is that it's a one-time correction with the free cash to eliminate any fear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16532.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and disruption to our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16536.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been saying for years that in the last five years, we've had zero new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16542.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you talk about new growth, that is the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16546.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The solution to any community's investment in finances is their new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16552.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in the city of Medford to hang our hats on other than a beer hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16560.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen anything bring in true funding other than a beer haul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16566.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, I've been pretty consistent with what I've been saying, but although you don't wanna look at transparency, I think that's the major issue right now is because the word, the information is not getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16579.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're voting on something that we've shown so many different reasons why we shouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16585.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16586.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many people, actual people that are gonna get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16591.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that to have a solution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16593.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's using free cash once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16596.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People keep saying that I'm saying that we do this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16600.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do this once because this community had over $35 million, over $34 million of free cash that we could have used and then sat together in an open process to see what we can do together as a total community to see what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16619.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16620.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, new growth and development is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16625.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the way that our budget was underfunded in certain aspects, but underappreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16633.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have to look at so many different options in the future, but what we lacked and the reason why we're here is because our mayor and our administration use one-time funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16647.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to carry her water for the last five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16652.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=808.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=810.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Larry Lepore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=813.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: someone we should all celebrate to know and be honored that he was our friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=818.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a while since you take that ride down Main Street and you notice his car's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=826.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At Alexander's, one of his favorite spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=831.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or the knock on your door and just so he can pat my dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=835.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or sometimes he would sneak away because he knew Dina was coming with Biscotti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=844.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he would always be so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=847.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we hear over and over about Larry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=852.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He never let politics get in the way of anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=857.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just such a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=859.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if you had a bad day, he'd tell you, he'd lend you that word that you're doing the job that people elected you to do and made you feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=874.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whatever you felt in yourself that it was the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=878.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=882.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to miss him so much because I think a lot of us, even though if you didn't know Larry long, it's amazing how you captured his spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=895.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even a night like tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=898.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, he'd look at me and we'd make eye contact with some stupid comment I'd make and I'd feel, oh, I owe him something later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=907.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or when someone would come up and they'd say something silly and he'd look at me with this like, are you kidding me type of face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=915.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he never did it with disrespect or without honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=919.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was such a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=921.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know the cancer that he fought at the end was very tough, very painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=929.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=936.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2400.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2402.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you said that if this job, from what I gather, if this, if we don't find a resolution, National Grid walks away and there is ramifications, like you said, could you explain that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2418.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there is a power outage with this piece being, you know, non-functioning that, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2425.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What part of the community is going to be affected if that's the case?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2460.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so hypothetically, if we don't move forward with this, there's a power outage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2467.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Parts of South Medford are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2485.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that situation, does that then facilitate an emergency service?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2490.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2496.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and then, if, Mr. O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2503.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we pay then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2525.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then the rule is still up for interpretation, still have to hop the car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2531.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=587.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=588.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=590.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work, but I think that one of the questions that I've been, um, that I've, I've received from the constituents is that when we wrote this RFP, we're getting to the point where, um, the question is down to a rise that is, is that we need to be answered is that when we wrote the RFP and we asked for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=610.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, in this to be the that were awarded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=613.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were talking about the process of going into the neighborhoods that our zoning changes would be affected so we can have our citizenry be part of that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=624.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, are we planning on doing that before we go to a city council final vote as we move<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=631.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: forward because that's something that was um stressed pretty pretty strongly when we discussed it with the prior city council so uh again i appreciate the hard work but i've been waiting uh to ask this question for the simple fact that it's what was intended when we first started the process so thank you thank you so much counselor i really appreciate that question um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=775.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor as a city council, I have a question and for you to deny that question for city staff is a serious issue, Madam Vice President, because I have a follow up to the question that you asked because I asked a specific question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=789.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The specific question I asked was when we asked to write the RFP and if I'll bring up the minutes, we will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=796.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we asked that we were going to take this directly to the neighborhoods and have an open discussion in those neighborhoods with open dialogue and meetings to get everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=807.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=808.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council is working on the transparency factor of what you think is correct, not what we decided on as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=818.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't disrespect me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=821.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't do that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=821.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done it three times tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=823.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=825.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=870.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=877.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=878.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's important as as make it make it to be clear that I've I've gone to listen to every meeting, gone to every meeting, and this is under the meeting preference that we're waiting on the process that was originally planned and the RFP that this will be taking to the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=897.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't answered that question yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=899.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=900.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that we've had open dialogue that we've done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=903.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=904.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I want to make it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=906.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This counselor hasn't brought this forward because I've been waiting for the process to walk through to see when is the plan and to go into the neighborhoods because that was the original discussion, Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=917.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=918.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1269.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to the election commissioners and they said that these rules are all posted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1275.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at City Hall and the election in the elections office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1277.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if anybody does need some clarity that the election office does have all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1283.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1731.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you like to read that first, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1930.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for Mr. Tomazak bringing forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1931.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've talked to a few of our friends in the audience and I think there was some confusion first that people seem to thought it was about the pop-up park, but it's not about the pop-up park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1943.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issues and concerns are something that we'll hear again later on tonight is that the way we're doing business in Medford is that we're really not getting the community involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1955.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they wanna say the community gets involved, but the truth of the matter is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1961.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me ask our seniors if we know that we have valuable land here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1966.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, I think there has to be an understanding that we need some growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1972.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if there was a partnership where we brought the process to the seniors and said, this is how we're going to look at the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1982.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wanna make sure that all of your concerns are taken care of and get your input so you can share what you're afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1991.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and making sure that we fill those gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1994.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure none of you have had that conversation with anybody from the city, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1997.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1999.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so this is what we're seeing right now in Medford, is that as we're going through our zoning changes, one thing we talked about was really going into the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2009.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We put that in the RFP actually, about when we rezone, when we look at projects like this, we go into those communities, just like neighbor communities do when they do big projects like Assembly Row,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2019.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and they do big projects like Union Square in Somerville, they actually bring city staff to the neighborhood where people come out and talk to you and you can share your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2029.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping moving forward by coming to this podium, there is an issue, there is a concern, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2037.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna say that we don't need new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2040.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna say that, I won't lie to you and tell you that I don't think that we need to use these parcels<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2046.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make a change to really invest in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2049.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, what we need is an understanding and a form of partnership where our seniors can say, okay, if you're going to take this lot, what lot are we going to build<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2064.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to make sure that it's similar vicinity that our seniors can park and walk across the street or walk next door so we can accommodate all of the programs that you said are so important to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2076.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think moving forward, I think that we have a, you know, I hear you loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2082.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm going to advocate to make sure that as we move forward, especially with this RFP and these five parcels I heard that I think it's three, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2090.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also told there was maybe five that are coming down the line that it's going to encompass the whole square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2095.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to see drastic changes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2098.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like we're forgetting the most vulnerable people in our community, mostly our seniors, and saying, well, let's just move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2106.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2108.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll share my information, my phone number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2110.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you feel fear in any way, give me a call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2113.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me at least try to be a voice as we go through this process, because unfortunately, it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that it could happen with a partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2123.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everybody's involved to make sure that all the concerns that you have are addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2129.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're not going to sleep thinking, are we going to lose the grieving program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2132.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to lose the knitting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2134.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to lose this program because there's nowhere to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2137.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2138.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to share that with you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2141.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that from what I've talked to a few of the seniors offline, and I think after this conversation I shared with them, they felt a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2151.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that we really need a buy-in from the city administration to work with our seniors, not just bring you cookies and pizza on election week, but really sit down with you and say, hey, what do you really need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2162.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And making sure that your needs are met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2164.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just just a point of information maybe some clarity for the planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3226.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the question that was reported back to me that part of the RP that the mentioned the mayor mentioned was that it was a looking at 40 spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3236.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the new developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3237.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that doesn't even come close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3239.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is why having this conversation is a beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3243.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's before it gets too late because we're down the line with other projects in the city that our community hasn't been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3252.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say community, it's having those meetings at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3258.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you set a vision of what you want this to look like, what you want Meffitt Square to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3262.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is where you bring in the business community, because some business members that were at that chamber meeting, really, they weren't very excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3269.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's some question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3270.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's why you have these meetings open to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3273.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you sit there with all the department heads, your planning department, your recreation department, your fire department, your police department, because there's so many things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3282.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you look at development that have to be considered, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3286.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we, if we build this many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3288.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we bring in this many people, are we going to have the infrastructure DPW can carry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3293.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we build it, bring in this many people, are we going to have enough police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3296.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we going to have fire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3298.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's so many, so many, and I only speak on this on as, as, as person who does this as a department head in the past, I worked for municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3307.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we do is before, before the city came out and just started giving out RFPs and getting the idea of the developers, because that's the problem with Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3317.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we bring the developers in to get their idea first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3319.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't that, that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3321.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the issue is in other communities what happens is you bring your stakeholders in first with the plans that were were derived that Medford has spent millions of dollars on that dust some of those off and say well these plans say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3335.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where do you feel and what do you fit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3337.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the first thing we see is our senior citizens have already come out and said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3340.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're scared that we're going to be overlooked and bypassed because one of the basic necessities we have is parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3348.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that could be something that you look at at a meeting like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3352.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping that the mayor really, really readjust and understand the process when it comes to the December proposals that come in, that we reassess again and look at the true process of true development and true input from our community, where we bring the meeting to you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3370.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not somewhere that you have to find one, you have to find where this meeting is and then go out and look for it and then not have the proper people in that can answer the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3378.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But neighboring communities, what they do is they bring everybody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3381.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So every question is answered right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3384.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then we could set up a comprehensive plan that involves all the stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3390.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that means that not everybody's gonna be happy with some of the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3395.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but at least they can look at outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3397.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one of the things we talked about in my neighboring community was it was affecting the process for one of our senior areas in Union Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3405.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So part of the deal was that we would have a shuttle system in place that would be built in with the developers that we don't need senior citizens who didn't need the parking in that area for it was identified for a small group, I think it was 50 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3420.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they looked at how they would shuttle the seniors in, and that was part of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3426.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's being creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3428.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's at least giving you an option to give you calm and understand that people are looking out for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3435.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a friend that came up to the podium said that our seniors are afraid that we're being forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3441.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3443.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard that in the last, especially three months in the process, we're seeing what's happening on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3449.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We hear you, at least I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3451.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to really put our money where our mouth is and really start opening up the dialogue with the most vulnerable members of our community, unfortunately, which are our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3460.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Beasley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3512.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the concern with that response was that not everybody is getting informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3519.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I'm hearing from everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3521.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might just check a box and say, we're having a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3524.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I understand the comprehensive plans that have been going on for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3526.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We spend millions of dollars on it, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3528.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, especially firsthand from our seniors, is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3533.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people are getting surveyed that then they say there's a survey of people say they've been spoken to people said there were meetings, but no one really knows when it seems like just a certain group understands against this message, because the average person, and you can look at what we have here in the auditorium today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3549.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're not getting the message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3550.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if that's the case, Council President, we need to do a better job as a community and a leadership in the city is to educate all of our members of our community so they can get involved with these processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3562.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4591.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4591.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Council, let me bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4594.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this is the outside the box thinking that we need to protect that most vulnerable, especially when you talk about the times we're in today so I and I think that Council saying is correct I think that what might help some people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4606.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, there are some people out there that'll question everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4609.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the city assessor could really support us by showing how the tax levy is, how many, if we looked at how many veterans needed the support and what that would look like and who would carry the brunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4625.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think if you asked nine out of 10 residents that we can support our seniors, I mean, our veterans,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4635.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and helping them through this process, I think that it would be supported wholeheartedly, but I think it would be good just to see that number, because I don't think it'd be drastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4646.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4808.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4810.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed that our, um, the consultant that this body approved its funding, um, has finished their assessment and has presented to the chief and his leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4825.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing that I found, um, that really struck me is that back in September, um, maybe the fire, um, our partners from the method fight apartment can help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4838.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4839.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, I know the mayor spoke on a podcast that mentioned the consultant directly and stating some pretty damaging wordage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4852.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would imagine that that letter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4855.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is public and is part of this body's purview to overview and use that input to help our residents, especially when they come up to Tuesday's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4867.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the Chief's here, and I know that President Marcellino's here from the Firefighters Union, and I know that, I believe the mayor used the consultant's words, she said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4879.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If she didn't fix the culture dysfunction with the fire department that someone could get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4884.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something she used to support her efforts, moving against anything to deal with the fire department but I think that that's something that is alarming to me when I heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4894.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4896.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the consultant is completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4898.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest issues that we're hearing right now and discrepancies that we're hearing from both the fire, um, firefighters themselves, the fire union who have come out publicly and chief Freeman, who was here the other day that spoke openly about the design of the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4917.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4919.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how people want to look at the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4921.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's one side or the other, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4923.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there should be only one side, and that's what we need in our community for our fire station, the best design possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4930.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I would imagine that, and correct me if I'm wrong, maybe Chief Evans can come up, that the pot of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4939.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: discussion must have been around a new design of a headquarters and getting some information out to the public, whether it's a, I know we're very popular with press releases, but really sharing any information that's given through a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4955.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: third party per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4956.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the yes group, it's not the no group, it's a third party that's come into the city and done an evaluation that the mayor has requested that this council has paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4965.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would hope that we can get that information out before the election on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4970.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know a lot of people have already gone out and voted, but I think that understanding what a consultant might think of that design might play a huge factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4978.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, if it's the fact that there isn't any information in those documents about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4985.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the design, then I stand corrected and we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4990.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it would be interesting to see if that was part of that consultant's purview to share their opinion when it comes to our main street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5001.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fire department and it's designed for a new station because I know that a lot of people right now are in flux whether they're going to support it or not and if it's something that comes out and says no there are some design that he does support what the administration is saying that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5018.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All perfect and it's ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5020.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the chief supported it through the letter that the mayor read in her blog or her report that it's definitely that he supports the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5031.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that having a party that is an outside specialist, I'd like to see if maybe the chief or anybody from the union has heard anything that can help us get that word out to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5047.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5090.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it could be released, especially with the election coming up in November about support or not supporting the fire design of the project, that if the consultant had information that we can share before the election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5133.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's nothing in the design that consultants about their thought of the design?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5142.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I don't know what I'm just saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5144.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's not, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5144.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5146.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I would do if we can, um, as well as, uh, appreciate that, that eliminates any, um, any, any thought process of trying to answer some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5156.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that if we can, Mr. President, that we do motion that we have, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5162.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if the consultant can come out later on after this as soon as we can to really review all of the findings with this council and if it needs to be to go to executive session that we go to an executive session because I know we as a council had some questions about having the fire department and talking with them about some concerns and maybe opening up executive session for them as well so I would put that in a form of a motion and hopefully we can do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5190.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before before the new year if we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5192.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5204.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that the chief has answered that, that there's nothing in the report that, you know, I thought that that might be interesting to see if a third party had some initial thoughts on that in the report, but if they don't, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5217.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's now we know if they don't, if we could just rephrase that, Mr. President, that we call for a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5223.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um a meeting uh before the new year it doesn't have to be right away now with the fire department and um the consultant to review their findings thank you got it so i would amend the resolution to um remove the question about the fire headquarters and then change it to requesting to attend a future council meeting to explain the findings perfect thank you mr president got it do you have that amendment mr clerk<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5609.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council Collins for leading our zoning team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5613.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5615.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: agreed 1000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5617.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5618.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we've been looking, looking into this for so many years but I just again, I bring forth the understanding that of course we've had a lot of meetings, we can see that there's been plenty of meetings but one of the things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5631.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we made sure with the past council that we really made sure that we tried to incorporate the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5639.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you could say that we've had these meetings been open up to everybody and this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5644.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what we talked about when we started the RFP process back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5648.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: back many many years ago the conversation really was and I hope there's still time to do this is bringing the meetings to those neighborhoods and getting the input from our citizenry and with a comprehensive plan together with all the departments together and getting the vision of what everybody wants to do and making sure that all of the needs are going to be met in that neighborhood<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5672.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I revert to the RFP that was written and the scope of work that it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5681.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: public outreach the consultant will develop a public outreach strategy designed to inform the community stakeholders and the general public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5689.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The strategy and design was brought up into the fact that what we were doing in Somerville as a department leader that really shined the light and made everybody feel like stakeholders<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5704.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember these meetings specifically that we all understood and agreed that going into these meetings, sitting down as a team, looking to see what everybody wants in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5714.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about my process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5716.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about how recreation played a process when we wanted to look at Union Square and how that process was derived and how it was built together with stakeholders at those meetings in their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5728.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've had a thousand meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5730.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that people have been informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5732.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not what we asked for as a council a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5736.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what part of the RFP was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5738.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll state the comment that was made in a meeting when we were deciding this and we were talking about this in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5746.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Pelli said, he thinks the most important thing in the community's input is community-based meetings, meaning in that zoning community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5755.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is something that I'm making up because I wanna be negative or I don't wanna do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5761.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna move forward with it, because I think we need to move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5764.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same vein, we have the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5767.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been talking with the people from Salem Street, and they feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5772.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's talked to them, no one sat with them in their backyard at the Roberts, like we did in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5778.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We go right in their yard, go to the Roberts Elementary School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5781.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You bring the neighbors there and say, okay, this is a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5783.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking to redevelop part of Salem Street to 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5788.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if you ask the people on Salem Street today, no one was really informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5792.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one really understood the process and no different what we're hearing on Mr Cav.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5796.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5799.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5800.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we need the reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5802.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've supported this from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5804.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we do need is the truth of what hasn't been done, and that's what was written in the RFP, to have community-based meetings to involve the areas that are being rezoned to get their input and make them feel like they're part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5817.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not all of a sudden they come in and say, well, there's 12 stories coming up and we really weren't part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5824.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, no, we've had 36 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5825.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we've had 36 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5827.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm telling you again, when we talk about surveys, and I'll use Car Park as an example, when they did Car Park over, we talked to Alicia saying that everybody was surveyed in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5839.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I live a few streets away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5840.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5841.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I asked my neighbors, no, they weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5843.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing the same thing as we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5845.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, this is the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5846.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we could still catch this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5849.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But all I implore to my council colleagues<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5853.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to do what was asked in the RFP and I'll make a motion to revisit or ask for the plan that associates must have because it's part of the scope of work of what they viewed envisioned of what the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5868.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the community outreaches because to me, we're not reaching them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5872.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, like I said, I'm going to support this because I think it needs to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5876.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same vein, before it gets too into the process, we really need to start having these community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5882.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really need to start informing our residents more about being part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5888.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're not shocked two years down the line when all of a sudden their neighborhood has changed so drastically that they can't live there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5896.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6034.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for myself so I can share this with the community is what that breakdown really means for the community input one on ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6043.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think that that would be important to Mr President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6045.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, I don't think it will be a concern or an issue or a violation to bring the meetings into neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6054.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done this in the past many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6056.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I think that that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6059.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that wouldn't be a hindrance at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6061.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate the words, but again, I do think that we should do more, like you said, and maybe outreaching and doing something in their communities, in those neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6073.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7730.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7732.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it me you're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7733.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7736.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, I know that recently I saw, I think it was a Stoneham truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7755.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's great with the fire department in your world that we can reach out to our brothers and sisters from neighboring communities to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7762.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that my thing is that I know that as we look forward to the capital plan that the mayor put out, we know we have two trucks coming, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7772.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that there were questions last year that we wanted to order two more, but if we didn't do it a certain time, it would be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7781.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: drastic, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7782.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what is I know the two are coming in 20 is it 2026?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7798.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so it looks like we need some band aids to get us through these first two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7803.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that do you know when the plan is for the other two was part of our 14 plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7809.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7810.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, that if we can, Mr. President, as part of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7814.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just get an update on the mayor's capital plan about the I know that we wanted to but waiting for two more fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7821.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think because if we keep we keep band aiding and keep it'll be no different than what we're seeing with the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7836.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's only so much bubble gum and duct tape that we can purchase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7840.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that these are serious issues and making sure our firefighters have, you know, it'd be funny if everybody jumps into Bobby's oil truck to go fight a fire because we don't have a truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7853.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think that I completely understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7859.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're going with this and it's if it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7863.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand but I have other questions but I yield to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8312.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8374.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Due to the situation with the override on November 5th, I would invoke rule 21<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8381.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to move this to the next meeting after the override for the fact that without understanding the true emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8398.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would invoke rule 21 and move this to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8401.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8548.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8549.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8551.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you define paper way so people can understand what that means, because a lot of people like where's paper way in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8558.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we can just explain that a little bit that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8635.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's out of necessity, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8637.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because of some structural issues to Joseph's way, is that what I'm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8683.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8686.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks pretty dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8687.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>
